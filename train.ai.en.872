I used to date Katie.
Wow.
like, once or twice?
for a couple years.
there's nothing between me and Katie.
and yet you felt the need to tell me that.
Katie and I were over long before Dan stepped in.
Oh, this is too good.
Hi.
Hi, it's nice to see you again. - You, too.
so I hope I'm not interrupting.
actually, I have to get back to work.
Oh, no, please, don't go. I'm just dropping something off.
no, really, I do actually have to leave.
it's a hospital. We never close.
thanks for lunch. - Got it.
I'll see you later.
see you. - Bye.
niners tickets. Thanks for helping out.
sure.
so, uh, I got to go. There's a thing at Zack's school.
okay. Good seeing you.
drop in on my next date.
you couldn't have given me a heads-up about the interrogation?
Oh, you met Hargraves. - Yeah.
he wanted to know how we were spending the booty.
he's just doing his job.
so, you didn't send him? - No.
this is his investigation. I'm homicide.
if the owner dies, you might see more of me.
Jack, Dan didn't do it.
I like her. - Yeah, she's fun.
but don't get too comfortable. It might not last.
Why?
you'll laugh. - What?
she doesn't want to have kids.
Wow. You live long enough...
um, so, when did you have this epiphany?
not too long ago. It's time.
I just need a fertile Myrtle, and I'm good to go.
someone who'll order in Chinese with you and watch South Park?
Oh, please. I'll die alone if I wait for perfection.
that's a good point.
you okay?
Yeah.
come on.
you see him?
no.
Hey, do you know where I could find Frank Vasser?
Thanks.
how old were you when he left?
Zack's age.
go, Dan.
Dan Carson, UPI. I'm doing a story on war correspondents.
could I talk to you for a second?
sorry, Ford's in town. Got to get to the St. Francis.
take your pictures, meet deadline, then off to the wash bag to decompress, right?
do I know you? - Herb Caen told me about you.
ten minutes.
five.
you can't drop a half a million tons of bombs on a country just 'cause it's next to Vietnam and not expect people to go crazy.
Yeah, no kidding.
we were over there when the Khmer Rouge rolled into Phnom Penh.
just teenage boys in red scarves yelling, waving guns around.
it was, uh...
it was real ugly.
how long were you there? - Four months.
had a hotel pool till a water buffalo died in it.
must have been hard on your family.
traveling comes with the job.
you know, it puts a roof over their heads.
there's a soldier I'm looking for.
army ranger special ops guy.
he was in Cambodia around that time.
a captain Rich?
you get a first name? - No.
well, if I knew a Captain Rich, I doubt he'd tell me he was special ops.
those guys don't talk about what they did over there. - Vasser!
Yeah. - What?
your wife's on the phone.
Yeah, you know, just, uh...
just tell her I'm not going to make dinner.
I got to go. - Okay.
thank you.
man, you, uh, sure you don't mean Ritchie?
sorry?
captain John Ritchie, went into Cambodia.
worked on the Ho Chi Minh trail.
he got shot up over there.
he was an army ranger.
where would I find him? - What's going on?
some broad just took a shot at Ford at the St. Francis.
great.
thanks a lot.
do you know where this Ritchie might be?
where he always is.
critters pub.
so, Dan has me looking for this guy who fought in the Vietnam war.
he thinks that's Dylan Mccleen?
maybe.
there's this one vets' message board and buddy search that's really good.
great.
bird-dog him.
well, uh, the board is for vets.
only.
Oh, come on, Jesse. You must be a veteran of something.
sure, I could be.
it's a little misleading.
is it illegal?
no.
it's the kind of stuff I used to do as a blogger, but...
look, are you going to be quoting anybody?
cite them as a source?
probably not.
this is a big story.
don't stop doing what got you hired.
so, you've got a hundred grand in walking-around money, and you drink in this dump.
they track the serial numbers.
have to be careful where I spend it.
Choung must have quite a family for you to want to spend the rest of your life on the FBI's most wanted list.
how do you know his name? - I'm a reporter.
tell me why you're looking for him.
if I was gonna turn you in, I would have done it by now.
I was wounded there.
his family hid me, fed me.
I promised him I'd get him out.
couldn't the government help you?
Nah.
everyone just wants to...
forget.
Yeah, but hijacking a plane is... - Cambodia's imploding, man.
people are getting slaughtered over there.
I needed money, and a bake sale wasn't gonna cut it.
so Choung didn't know what you were doing.
hell, no.
after I bailed out of the plane, they had a man hunt going for about six weeks.
I laid low until they left.
by the time I got to San Francisco, Choung was gone.
he probably went to Cambodia to try to get his family out by himself, which means...
they're all dead.
maybe not.
I'm not paying you to eat.
let's get out of here.
what are you doing? Who are you?
Hey, that's my dish diver.
I think he's quitting.
Oh, no, no, I got 15 tables, man. I...
imagining a place...
I'm calling the cops!
do you know where your family is? - Yes.
my friend in Thailand tell me. - Okay.
you got about five minutes to pack.
we fly to Thailand tomorrow.
I never unpacked.
so what, you're just going to buy your way out?
it's a little more complicated than that.
let's just say I still have some infrastructure there.
well, good luck. I think this is where I get off.
Hey, here. - No, thanks.
I only need 50 grand. Just don't spend it all in one place.
I don't want the money.
fine.
let me buy your Jacket. - My what?
the place is crawling with cops.
I don't need to be answering a lot of questions.
you can take it.
you can take mine.
what, and take the rap for your hijacking?
that's got to be, what, 30 to life? - Then don't get caught.
thanks you you're sitting on a pretty big story here.
who says I'm sitting on it?
let's go huh.
Hello?
professor Choung Seng?
Yes.
professor Seng, this is Dan Vasser from the Register.
I'm doing a story on the Khmer Rouge.
Oh.
Yeah, I know. Uh, you had family there.
Yes.
are they...
are they still there?
I was one of the lucky ones.
Really?
I got my family out.
but the others...
this is kind of a bad time. Can I call you back?
Yes, of course. Um, I'll call you tomorrow.
thank you.
your name again? - Uh, Dan.
okay, Dan.
good-bye.
good-bye.
where you going? - Home.
I really got to see my son. - No, you can't. You got to stay here.
what are you talking about? - I found Captain Rich.
but actually, it's Ritchie. Captain John Ritchie.
he's a former army ranger. In Cambodia from '68 to '73.
expert parachutist. And, uh, oh, get this.
in 1976, he got caughtin an airport in bali with 12k in cash.
think he was taking a little vacation.
so, what's he doing now?
he owns a custom motorcycle shop in Mission Viejo.
wife, couple of kids.
it's a dry hole.
what? - I already checked out Ritchie.
he's got an alibi for the day of the flight.
he talked to FBI in '76.
sorry. - You sure?
positive. - Damn it.
I said I'd kill it if I didn't have it. Problem?
no.
Hello, there. - Hello.
Hi.
you're in a good mood.
I love coming home.
I just put Zack down, if you want to go say good night.
I'd like that very much.
what's that?
football tickets? - Three.
let Jack keep the other two.
how much did they cost you? - Don't worry.
I used some of our mad money.
mad money? - Yeah.
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god!
Dan, where did you get all that?
I knocked off a liquor store. - Dan...
Katie, relax. - Relax?
you had a gun. Now you have money. Tell me how any of that is soothing.
it's Dylan Mccleen's. - The hijacker?
it's a long story.
can I say goodnight to Zack, then I'll tell you about it over a glass of wine?
sure.
I'm awake. - Hey.
guess what? - What?
we're all going.
I'm sorry I haven't been around much lately.
it's okay, dad.
it's not, but I'm going to try to do better.
it's okay, dad. I think it's cool.
you think it's cool? - I saw it, dad.
what did you see? - You.
what did you see, Zack? - You're magic.
don't say that. Absolutely gross.
my God! Gorgeous!
perfect.
that was a ten! A perfect ten!
ai Jolson, you mind jumping in the water and also screaming on the way down, "l love my daddy"?
okay.
Yeah, do it, do it for me.
do it for Da-da. I love my daddy.
daddy is my favorite adult!
you're paying her enough for this, right?
and I love you, my little British crumpet!
all right, homeboy, you're up next. Let's go.
come up with something on your own.
you gotta squeeze out another log?
what happened? What'd he whisper to you?
water's too deep.
water's too deep for what?
he can't swim.
he can't swim?
and you wanna swim with the dolphins?
that makes a lot of sense.
haunt thought it through.
no kidding you didn't think it through.
thought about spending all my money, didn't you?
Danny! I'm saying, I'm not the kid's...
no one taught you how to swim, huh?
my dad's supposed to, but he's busy.
busy being an idiot.
you guys have to come in, the water feels magical!
I got something magical, too. Right in the downstairs area.
I don't high-five when it's...
downstairs area!
no, put it away.
you know what? I think Mommy's gonna explore the magical waters.
honey, are you okay to hang out here with fake Daddy?
sure.
Really? You're gonna get undressed?
what are you doing?
what? You got a bathing cap, too?
you're the worst.
a 1920s swimming gown on, honey?
don't do it. Don't take it off.
Yeah. I have to be alone.
okay.
God, I gotta start taking the stairs more.
don't buy that line.
she takes spinning classes like they're M&M's.
I think he's wearing my underwear.
what is he doing?
I guarantee you fall!
I'm all set.
Ow!
thank you, God.
I wanna climb Palmer Mountain, so what do you say we get rid of these kids?
no. They had them last night. It's our turn.
isn't that how things work? We alternate?
what? No.
I get the kids... I had them today.
that counted as a "me" day and then she gets them at night.
that's how we do it.
Dolph, Devlin, do you want us to watch the kids so that you guys can have a little alone time?
I don't think...Yes! Absoshnutely!
we are sleeping together!
you guys have your own beds and it's our time!
so we're gonna watch them.
you guys wanna come take a look at the balcony?
I think I saw some dolphins around here.
dolphins? Hey, he loves those, right? Dolphins.
sorry. Okay, go.
all right, let go. Come on.
get the dolphins. Bye, you guys.
that's why we're here, the dolphins.
see you out there.
listen, if anything happens and you need any... And I mean anything, you have to call me.
I'm good at this, I swear to you.
I used to baby-sit Eddie when we were children.
Eddie is your fault? No, no, no.
but I want you to enjoy tonight.
come on, it's like a free night.
you can do whatever you want.
you can knit yourself some socks or shock people with your sneaky hot body.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm just gonna sit in my room and worry about you and them and everything.
what about just hang out platonically with Eddie tonight? Have some dinner?
or is he not good enough?
you need Brian, the guy from Foghat, around here.
that really bothered you that I went to lunch with that guy.
what do you mean, you went to lunch with him?
I told you I was going to lunch with him.
I thought it was he asked you to lunch and you were gonna like scoff at it.
but you did? You fell for his charms?
I don't even understand what this is.
it's the beard, man.
it doesn't move!
in the wind, man. it's flapping around.
all right. You know what? I'll tell you this.
the guy made it through an entire lunch with a woman without making up a fake life.
Ah.
you just hurt me.
that was not nice, but it was the truth.
and I speak the truth.
please pay attention to my children.
everything will be nice.
they serve room service in the hallway.
I'm so nauseous. Okay. Bye.
alone at last!
let's play the game.
we were doing so good with the game.
if you could be one person besides yourself, "who would you be"?
Rachael Ray, because I've always wanted to know how to cook.
Really? Oh, she's darling.
you know what? I don't really wanna be anyone else.
I'm happy with who I am. I choose me.
or Captain Kirk. Either one.
see, that's a good one. All right.
what about you, Bart?
Mr. DeCesare.
our mailman? Why?
he just seems like he's got it all figured out.
we're getting deep.
okay, moving on.
name something that makes you sad.
that Judi Dench has never won the Oscar for Best Actress.
it's a travesty.
that 'N Sync broke up.
Yeah. That was rough on all of us.
who's 'N Sync?
sadness. Bart, you're up.
I don't wanna say mine.
okay. Let's move on then.
Hey!
honey, come on. You can share anything with us.
Yeah, share.
he looks like he's about to lose it, but okay.
when my dad doesn't have time for me.
come on, it's okay.
we're okay. it's fine.
it's all gonna be okay. Come on.
we don't need him in our lives.
Wow.
no, no, no, he's...
we're okay. It's fine.
it's all gonna be okay.
this has nothing to...
this is, like, from a long time ago!
it's okay.
what are you doing?
well, that was a major setback "When my dad doesn't have time for me."
we're sorry.
I know you're sorry.
I know you got real stuff going on with your family.
and it's painful.
but you gotta just hold it in till you get to the mainland again.
you're the ones who wanted to come here and go swimming with the dolphins or standing with the dolphins because you can't swim
can you act professional? Yes, sir.
for at least two more days, until I kill you off in a boarding school train accident?
I thought it was a car accident.
I don't know. Either that or a science explosion, just something.
you're gonna be dead soon. That's the good news. Okay?
so, can you just focus for a few more days?
Yes. Good.
so, give me some fake hugs right now and laugh real loud like we're the happiest family on earth.
okay. Is that possible?
and laughing, laughing, laughing.
that's it. Laugh louder, louder.
I love you guys!
Hey, sweetie! What's going on? What's up?
so, kids, I just got off the phone with your mom and you guys are gonna have plenty of time to spend with your dad tomorrow because she and I are gonna have a nice, long spa day.
Aw!
awesome! Awesome, awesome.
you guys are so...
I'll see you in a minute, okay? I love you.
he's losing it. Okay, good night.
he's losing it.
all right, here we go. Everybody out.
so, what are we doing?
Palmer forgot her camera in the room so I'm gonna have a surprise for her when she gets back from the spa.
a stolen camera?
no, some pictures of us having a great time reassuring her of all the fun we have together.
I forgot to flush the toilet before I left the hotel.
so she's gonna have two surprises.
no one's supposed to crap as much as you do.
you gotta look into that Pepto Bismol or something.
here's your putters. Bing.
and a bam. Thank you.
let's just look right in the camera. And we're having fun.
and we're a family. We love each other.
and boo!
let's do the old Michael-hit-a-putt shot. Okay?
so boom, that's in the hole.
and you're excited about that, and we're happy for him, and...
Maggie just hit the ball, but you followed through too much and it made you fall on your back.
okay, but... Look at this.
you're laughing, but I'm a concerned father, so I'm like, "Oh, my God."
all right, now, let's just laugh at something I say, because I'm a funny dad.
you're very close with me, and you think I'm funny, and...
why are we always laughing?
is there something wrong with us?
no. You're just amused by everything I say. So, here we go.
can we take a break? Do something really fun?
no, we're not doing anything fun, man.
we're here to fake having fun.
come on. Right to the camera.
don't worry. We never have fun with our real dad either.
Oh, man.
all right. How's this?
I'll teach you how to swim, okay?
before your mother gets back from the "spa day" in four hours?
is that even possible? Yeah.
but we're gonna take one more picture, if you don't mind.
make that two pictures. Maggie.
throw this straight in the air. Make it look like...
on the count of three, one, two, three.
okay.
now, Michael, lay down.
on your back. And...
Yeah, all the way over. See if you can clench this.
now look like you're in pain.
Ooh!
it took my friend a whole summer to learn how to swim.
How're you gonna teach me so quick?
I'm gonna do it the same way my grandfather taught me.
don't worry.
it took Grandpa eight hours to teach us.
it was a nightmare.
but there's two of us here now, and we're sober.
you're gonna be fine.
all right. You're doing great.
is he doing great? He's doing great.
okay. We want to advance a little, though.
I need you to swim to Uncle Eddie.
if you get there without touching the bottom, we'll give you a dolphin cookie.
is that what your grandpa gave you?
no, Grandpa gave us something he'd call a Heineken.
I want one of those.
no. Stick with the dolphin cookie.
Yeah. They hurt less when they get thrown at your head.
God, he was a sick man.
Yeah. Okay? Are we ready?
don't think about it. Commit. Kick, kick.
get the cookie. Move your feet.
kick, kick!
right there! Reach for it! You got it!
doing good, buddy!
there you go!
my boy! That was terrific, buddy.
have your cookie. We're gonna move on, though.
Hey, Devlin?
Devlin? Yeah?
so, Danny's birthday is next week, and I have no idea what to get him.
well, don't get him a tie.
he has 100 of them and he never wears them.
that's good to know.
he loves books on tape for his oar.
fishing gear.
loves it. Doesn't use it.
can't take the fish off of the hook once he catches it, so he just collects it.
he loves candy. Jelly Bellies. Loves them, his favorite.
but he only likes the Cotton Candy and the Peanut Butter.
so you have to buy the bag of the Jelly Bellies, separate the Cotton Candy and the Peanut Butter and put them into a little...
it's a kind of Ziploc baggies that I got online.
you know so much about him.
Yeah.
I've known the guy forever.
music. Loves music.
but anything after '95, don't bother.
you'll lose him.
that's when I finished my Girl Scouts.
all right. How many cookies do we got left?
maybe about forty!
what do you think, 40 feet for 40 cookies?
can you handle that? You need a little rest?
let's do this.
Really? Okay, he's ready! He's ready to rock!
almost.
what? No.
Oh, my! Ladies and gentlemen, off come the floaties!
this is getting serious!
are you sure about this, Michael?
hell, yeah. All right.
no matter what, you're a good man, okay?
keep kicking. I'm here if you need me.
you got this.
go! Go, Michael!
go! Breathe! Yeah!
move your arms! Yeah!
he doesn't have floaties on!
Oh, my God!
get the cookies!
come on, sweetheart! You've got it!
a little bit more, little bit more.
swim! Swim! Oh, my God!
come on! Just a little bit more!
keep going, Michael! Don't give up!
very nice!
that's my boy! Yeah, buddy!
I did it! I did it! Thank you!
no way, that was you, buddy.
that was awesome. Way to go!
what are we looking at?
jeez. Oh, God. Devlin.
Devlin. Oh, God. You snuck up on me.
did I? Oh... Yes.
do you startle easily? That's a sign of menopause.
Hmm...
Devlin?
Palmer Dodge, this is Devlin.
she and I went to college together.
this is Palmer Dodge. Aloha, Palmer.
is this your daughter?
no, no, no. I'm actually the girlfriend.
whose girlfriend?
Yes, hi.
I am the Dolph. Willkommen. And you're very beautiful.
married, flattered. Thanks. Where's Danny?
Danny is in the water teaching our little boy how to swim.
Hi, Doctor!
he was so sweet.
you know what's so crazy is that I have never met anybody with the first name Devlin before.
you know, and here you are, and your name's Devlin and...
shark attack!
we are playing Bavarian pool rugby and now I'm in the lead.
okay, bye!
she's trying to beat me, but she won't.
no OHS Can!
this is fun!
anyway, something's opened up in our schedule tonight.
so, we were wondering if you and Danny were good to go for dinner.
Oceano's. Seven o'clock. Oh, no...
you don't! She's like a shark. Come on.
is it a bad night? Are you two fighting?
No! We're not fighting.
no, we just, We're delighting. We're just fine.
no, that's great. Tonight's gonna happen. Yeah, perfect.
perfect. Anyway, see you tonight!
okay, Devlin.
Oh, my God! Dolph, let her breathe!
Yes, I...
Dolph! What?
what was that?
I was... Were you under...
I don't understand. Why would you say yes?
because I didn't know, I didn't say no.
I'm not leaving here. What would I tell Palmer?
what's going on, sweetie?
so, today, you know, with Dolph pushing me in the pool.
it was weird, right?
no, no, no. He's a sheepherder.
that's what those guys do, you know?
they do a lot of horseplay and that's kind of initiation time for you.
you're in the gang, I think.
okay. Yeah.
well, I was thinking for tonight, maybe we could have a little me and you time?
Oh!
I'll get my rubber duck and see you in a sec.
Yeah, no, I'm not doing this tonight.
it's like my first night alone with the girl.
all I'm asking you is one favor!
just get this one dinner with me so I can save face with this horrible, heinous human being.
what am I gonna tell Palmer?
would you just put her on the phone?
Oh, God.
tell me she is not listening to 'N Sync.
no, no, no. It's coming from the elevator.
Hey!
Danny, that is my jam.
someone on the phone for you.
I don't know who. Okay.
Hello?
what is that?
it's Palmer. So?
I need you to get on the phone. I need you to ask her out.
I need you to take her as far away from the hotel for the entire night.
would you please just do this for me?
no, I'm already eating. I just wanna hang out. Ow!
seriously, I need you. What are you doing? No.
Ow! My gosh.
take it. All right.
go for Dolph.
it's Dolph.
okay, I got an idea.
how about you and me, we go and get the dinner tonight?
to supper?
tonight?
Yes, and we get to know each other, because I think it's important for the kids to have good symmetry in the family unit.
Yeah, hang on. Let me check with Danny.
Dolph wants to do dinner tonight.
no. No, no, no.
all right, tell him yeah.
Yeah, that's fine.
awesome. Thank you so much.
what am I supposed to say to her all night?
you spout crazy nonsense for hours in Eurotrashenese.
just do it, but just do it far away from the hotel.
okay, fine, I'll do it, but if I do good, can I sleep in the bed with you?
no. Why? You've got a great private room.
hmm, really? Because when we were in the Napa Valley, they said that wasn't a good time of year for Merlot.
how about the Verite Cabernet?
isn't Cabernet really grapey?
I mean, I like grapey, but not overly grapey.
did you go over the index cards?
I glanced at them, yes.
you glanced at them?
I graduated med school without reading a book. Just relax.
just give us the most expensive bottle you have and it'll probably be good enough.
perfect!
look at us, Katherine. Both so happily married. I mean...
can you believe it?
everything I always hoped for, right, Yogi?
Mmm. Boo-Boo.
my Yogi Bear. My Boo-Boo.
never enough.
hold on a second.
I love the way you smell.
nothing smells as good as Devlin.
smelling Devlin, always a good thing.
this is really where we're eating?
Oh, yes. No, the hotel says it's amazing und very far away. Yeah, it's good.
Hey. I want that car.
I'll give you two chickens for it.
two chickens, that's very nice of you, but...
don't be scared.
we're just here for dinner.
also, this car's worth about 10, 000 chickens.
don't pour over me.
don't pour over me.
I'll bring my glass to you.
so, Danny, you're a plastic surgeon. Yes.
very convenient for you, Katherine.
no, this girl's had nothing done.
she's just a natural beauty.
she really is. Sweetie.
what about me? What would you do to fix me?
professionally speaking?
nothing. l wouldn't do a thing to you.
nothing?
you're too sweet.
they already took too much fat out of your arms, but that's what sleeves are for.
so, where did you two meet?
we just, we met at a concert.
sting. Yeah.
live at the Index Card.
it was a benefit for the rainforest.
someone's on the phone for you.
I think it's the guy from The Omen.
go for the IMan.
hold on a second.
can I say something before you say what you're gonna say?
seeing the man who invented the iPod, on the iPhone, saying, "Go for the IMan... " Yeah.
...that was like watching Ronald McDonald eat a cheeseburger off the Grimace.
I'm serious. That was serious stuff. It's so true.
that, to me, was like watching Dr. Kevorkian kill himself.
Oh, no.
I'm sorry. This is one of my foundations.
I've gotta take this.
your virtue, your intelligence, your passion.
your beauty, your drive, and your womanhood.
it's something we do whenever the other leaves.
we say what we love most about the other.
that's really nice. That's big. I like that.
you guys should try it.
Yes, we should. We should. We'll try that later.
we have to. Not everyone can do it.
we'll do it now.
right now. Okay.
so, broke and penniless,
I took to the streets to sell my wares.
and by wares, I mean my body.
and by body, I mean my schnitzel.
help! Is there a veterinarian in the house?
my pet sheep, he passed out. He's not breathing!
I don't know what's wrong with him!
him! Him! He's not a vet, but he sells sheep for a living.
Oh, me, yes.
I do, yes. I am that.
please come this way!
now? Yes!
this way, this way!
what is this?
is that a real sheep?
okay.
Yes, um...
hello...
yes?
Yes, in my expert opinion, that sheep is dead.
I'm very sorry.
let's go eat. Okay, show's over. Let's go.
Oh! He's still alive!
please, you have to do something!
Oh, shit on me.
you look each other in the eyes and you say what you love about the other. Mmm-hmm.
we can't just say it? We gotta look at each other for this thing?
okay. Yes. We're so ready.
are you ready?
go ahead.
you're on. Okay.
come on.
um...
I love your sense of humor.
you do? Mmm-hmm.
all of it?
every dirty bit of it.
I love your, uh, stories.
Yes. They can go long, but... It's okay.
...I try to finish strong. Always entertaining.
and I love that you...
love that you read the index cards.
of course.
and I love that you secretly have a huge heart, and it's just filled with kindness and humility.
and blood?
I'm sure there's blood.
I don't know, I...
I just think you're a really nice person and I really like...
I really love spending time with you.
that's good enough for me right there.
Yeah, game over.
Danny?
game back on? We gotta...
um...
well, I'd like to start off by saying that I love the most that you fixed your teeth.
why did I know that...
they were horrible, I agree.
no, no. Um...
you know what I love? Mmm-hmm?
how you just do everything for everybody else and you never expect anything back.
in fact, when I say thank you, I don't know, do you hear that or not?
it's cute.
and I love...
I just love...
you're the only person I've never lied to in my life.
I swear to God.
I just trust you more than anybody in the world.
you know every secret about me.
I love your smile.
that smile is the magic.
when I'm in the operating room all I think about is, "All right, 20 more minutes, I get to see the smile."
it's just like...
it starts my day, that smile.
I won best smile at our sorority three years straight, right, Katherine?
not little Bucky here.
okay, here we go! Hi, yes! Wee!
we do the sheep dance, right?
we want to live and dance more, yes.
okay, all right. Here we go. Eat some food.
eat the food. Come on, here we go.
couple more zings.
make the milk. Yes, he makes the milk.
you love it. You give milk to the baby.
all right. One, two, three, here we go!
come on!
we got a couple things that I know how to do!
Yes, this is a good test, so why not?
all right. Here we go.
you're killing him!
the sheep lives! The sheep lives!
Yes! Here we go, one more time.
here we go. Yes!
this is what I did. You saw this. Yes!
welcome. I am Tanner Patrick, Jr.
we're ready for the legendary Oceano's Hula Competition.
Legendary? Never heard of it!
legendary like the day you were once sober. So...
she talks the talk, who will walk the walk and walk with me to the Ladies' Lounge? Feeling it...
I think you should do it, Devlin.
because she would win.
I'll do it! Oh! Good show!
Katherine? How about you?
come on, this isn't Katherine's thing. Right, Katherine?
no, no, not my... Her speed. Not mine.
some people are just more comfortable on the sidelines, so don't judge her, honey.
your honesty, your fearlessness, and your tickle spot.
your creativity, your bravery, and your taffy nipples.
let's go! How do I win this thing?
I'm gonna do this hula thing.
Oh, don't feel any pressure, Katherine.
I'm not the one who should feel the pressure.
ladies and gentlemen, a warm welcome for tonight's hula girls.
these are my stars. And here's the key, you decide how brightly they shine tonight.
you the audience, judge and jury.
I like what I see.
this is my hula palooza.
you're the judges.
you're voting for your favorite hula girl.
how about we do one over here?
can I get a little something-something up here in the corner?
has anybody got a conscience here tonight?
come on, you did well. You did well.
Aw!
lt's tough.
what do I got over here? Anybody?
how tall do you think that guy is?
who? The Tanner guy? I don't know.
Yeah, that Tanner.
looks pretty tall, I'd say he's like 6'3."
Yeah, I don't know.
can I get a positive reaction?
thank you.
how about this little girl? Let's make her night. How about it?
I like it. Keep the mojo going.
how about Big Country in the corner?
do I got...
sorry.
this is fixed!
tall fellow is lucky to get away.
let's pick up the tempo, boys.
what? What is that?
okay. This is a lot faster.
fabulous!
Yeah, baby!
what?
come on.
nobody got cheated here tonight.
these are two of the hottest chicks we have ever had up here.
but our job is not done.
I need your help, because I need a winner.
let me hear you.
beautiful!
wow, that is gonna be tough to beat.
let's not kid anybody. How about over here?
there you have it. We have ourselves...
that's my Boo-Boo!
a tie! We have ourselves a tie.
that's great. We both win. Good...
what's the tiebreaker?
what's the tiebreaker?
this is how we settle ties in my house.
it's something I like to call Coconut Smoochie.
the object of the game is, the coconut is in their midsections.
it must move all the way up to their mouths without the use of their hands.
focus, focus.
if you touch the coconut, you are disqualified.
okay. Ready? One, two, three, get coconutty!
okay. Slow.
okay, all right. Calm down, calm down.
let me just bring it up to you.
okay, do it.
get it up there. Come on.
bring your coconuts down to me.
okay. Oh, my coconuts.
pull up. All right. I'm so low.
squeeze your coconuts. Squeeze them.
use every crevice you can. Don't be afraid.
I can't get it up here.
I'm trying.
would you be quiet?
stay there. Wait.
okay, that's good. Is that good?
sorry about this, by the way.
Really? You're really sorry about this?
no, I'm not. I like it.
Oh, yeah!
pick it up, pick it up!
not with your hands, you buffoon!
come on!
look what he's doing! What happened? I can't see.
focus. Take it slow, take it slow.
he's got it!
that's not fair. He can't do that.
no, that's a clean pick-up right there.
okay. Bring it over here.
go! Go! Go!
I got it.
there's still time. Let's go.
you can touch each other, you cannot touch the coconut.
hang on, hang on.
what's going on? What is that? What do you use?
what's the hold-up? You still got that perfume on, huh?
would you stop it?
smells good. Come on, let's go.
have you got it to your mouth yet, Boo-Boo?
stop putting your ass in my face.
I like it. That's my girl. Okay.
we've got a winner! We have a winner! We have a winner.
coconut Smoochie champions right here.
awesome.
you suck at everything!
boo-boo.
great teamwork, guys.
how long have you two been married?
eight years. Ten years.
ten years. Eight.
very long time. A very long time.
did you see the look on her face? Yes.
do you understand what joy that brought me?
how about the look on her face when you were doing the juggling, though?
the juggling was the highlight for me.
that was pretty good. You liked that?
it was so cute.
and when you talked about her arms getting done?
the good news is she's beating the hell out of the iPod guy right now.
right now, I know.
that was good. That was really fun.
you know what, I think that was the first time that you and I have ever gone out, you know, just us.
I know. I do.
I feel bad for the Soul Patch now.
I do.
now that you've been out with a real man.
and by a real man, I mean a man who showers.
I think it's so adorable how obsessed you are with this guy.
I just can't picture you guys on a date, you know what I mean?
who said it was a date ever?
you. You.
you get very excited when you talk to this man.
listen, Dr. Gervitz is moving his practice to New York City.
Yeah.
Brian is not gonna go with him, and he...
he's just been asking me if.
I would want to, you know, replace him.
you're going?
no.
you can't do that to me.
I just wanted to see how you'd react.
look at you. You can't live without me.
what do I do? How do I sign it?
how do I pay for it?
no. You kind of played with me a little bit, though.
you could've told me that earlier.
you're just messing with me?
trying to get me a little jealous, weren't you?
no. I just was having fun teasing you.
that was fun. Why? Were you jealous?
no. Get outta here. Was I jealous? No.
look at you. You're grinning, you can't stop, what is that smile?
I didn't know you had that many teeth.
I know. I got like 55 teeth.
no. So there's nothing?
you and... There's nothing?
no love connection? Mmm-mmm. Nothing.
no.
well, then, that's a shame.
what?
that coconut getting in the way tonight.
that's a shame, don't you think? Oh.
no. No, that was bad.
the coconut.
you're lucky that coconut was there.
you couldn't... You wouldn't have been able to handle it.
maybe you're right.
you got more tricks that I don't know about?
I don't know.
okay.
I don't know anything.
mommy? Mommy?
Hi, guys!
Hey! What're you doing?
the babysitter fell asleep.
Oh, great.
I mean, come on, it's like a Hawaiian Rosa, huh?
is it? Oh, my God.
Yeah, that's asleep.
look at that.
Wow. She's out deep.
all right. Good to see you guys.
good night.
good job. One more day of lying, guys.
we're almost done. Home stretch.
all right. So, you gotta go to sleep.
Yeah.
tired? Yes. Good night.
okay. That was fun. Good job.
good night. Good night.
good night. All right.
okay, Danny.
okay, good luck. I'll see you in the morning.
she ain't going to sleep.
Hello! There he is, Danny!
it's nice to meet you.
where were you going?
what?
I was going... I was going to...
where were you guys?
I was looking for you guys at...
what happened? How was the dinner?
Dolph gave mouth- to-mouth to a sheep.
Yeah. And then we had a few drinks.
Yes. It was choking and so I gave him sheep-P-R.
but he was the black sheep of the family, but he was also white, if that makes any sense.
and we've been talking about now amazing this trip has been and how amazing you are.
Yeah, all joking aside, it really has been first-class.
and that, if the kids and I hadn't kept you so busy, that you might've had the time to do something you've been thinking about doing?
the one ringy-dingy?
uh... Yeah, you told her about that?
I don't need you to get me a ring, Danny.
let's just get married. Right here.
what now?
why not? We're in Hawaii. Let's do it tomorrow.
I mean, this has felt special from the moment that we met.
and I've seen the way that you are with the kids, and it's exactly the way I always imagined my husband would be.
Oh, man...
I don't wanna wait.
I just wanna start my life with you.
Hi!
Hi, everybody! Dolph.
there you are.
I have been looking everywhere for you.
for me? Yes. Come here. Come on, let's go.
no way, we can't go. What?
my little Oompa Loompa.
Danny and Palmer, they're getting married tomorrow!
what?
no, no, I mean, why?
Yeah, we are. But what do you think?
what do you mean, what do I think?
I mean, what does it matter what I think?
I think that's great.
thank you, Devlin.
I really hope that you can be there tomorrow.
I can't.
it's really...
it's bad luck for the ex to be at the wedding.
come on, Dolph. Let's go.
where are we going? They are here.
we gotta have the sweet sex.
what? Okay? Come on.
okay. Congratulations, though.
I'm trying them on as we speak.
I know, but I just bought them.
I had some with me and the one I have on is pretty amazing.
Michael!
nincompoop!
Nincompoopenschtic!
Michael, the crap is the stinking...
Hello?
Hey, you up?
Hi. Yeah. Glad you called.
are you?
um...
Yeah, I was, uh, just checking flights for your parents tomorrow and I found...
no, no, no. You don't have to do that.
her parents aren't coming in and she wants it to be kind of elope-y.
elope-y.
got it.
okay, uh, so, are you all set for what you need to wear tomorrow?
do you think this is a good idea?
what? The wedding?
Yeah, the wedding... Just the whole Palmer thing.
well, that's why we came out here, right?
I guess.
you don't think it's crazy?
um, Danny, you don't need my permission.
okay? You're a big boy.
I know, I just...
I know if I do this that...
just, things could get weird between you and me at the office, so...
well, you're not gonna have to worry about that.
you going to New York?
Yeah. I just, you know, I mean...
as much as I was looking forward to you, um, reconstructing my face,
I really just need to start fresh, you know?
Hello, are you there?
you understand?
I guess.
it's an awful lot of guessing coming through this phone.
I've been divorced, I have two kids,
I don't have time for guessing.
got a big day tomorrow, Doc, all right?
so why don't you just get yourself some sleep?
so that's it. You have nothing else to worry about.
we have the flowers, the music and the location, which is ha-wowie, by the way, you're gonna love it.
I promise you it is going to be the most wonderful day of your life, guaranteed.
Devlin. Yeah.
Oh! Palmer! I didn't...
well, you just look absolutely beautiful.
Really? Thank you. Yes.
Devlin, can I ask you something?
course.
do you still want to be with Danny?
wait. What?
because I think that he still may be in love with you.
Really?
why would you think that?
he's always glowing when you're around.
and he laughs at your jokes. He doesn't laugh at mine.
Palmer, trust me, there is nothing between me and Danny.
we're just, you know, we're familiar.
and you are the girl for him.
he even told me that last night.
my God, Devlin, this is such a relief because I could never stand a chance going up against you.
turn around. Tell me if this fits.
put the hanger up your nose.
stop!
excuse me.
here you go. Thank you.
Katherine!
Katherine! Oh, Devlin.
that was so much fun last night.
I know.
I am still trying to work out how you cheated.
I didn't. That's what happened.
so, where's Danny?
Devlin...
Danny's at his wedding.
come again?
I was never married to him.
all a big lie that I made up.
Why?
cause I couldn't stand the thought of you knowing the truth.
Really?
so, yeah, I'm a single mother.
I have two kids that I love more than anything in the world.
I drive a Honda. Still have dial-up internet.
I got a 2. 7 GPA in college, not a 3. 4.
and while I'm at it telling the truth,
I named my kids' poop after you.
and I work for Danny. I'm his assistant.
that's it.
really, I would never have guessed this.
I mean, you two had a real connection.
he's great. He's the greatest guy.
and I might even be in love with him, but that doesn't really matter at this moment because he is getting married to another person right now.
Ian and I are breaking up.
what? What happened?
well, for starters, he's gay.
he's gay?
I mean, look at him.
that's a strong muscle right there.
I'm squeezing.
Devlin, I gotta tell you, last night, with the ass grab of the coconut, little bit of a red flag.
I've seen him do that with the soap.
what about the iPod?
Oh, he didn't invent shit.
he didn't?
No! He made his money suing the Dodgers after he got hit by a foul ball.
Oh, God! That's so...What?
well, this is different.
Yeah, why didn't we try this truth-telling thing before?
I don't know.
Hey. Hey.
what?
that's nice.
it's nice to tell the truth. That's good.
the truth is fun, isn't it?
like, were you telling the truth when you said you might be in love with me?
I'm gonna leave you two. Okay.
I'm gonna go get a divorce. Good luck.
wait, where are my kids?
Palmer took them out for ice cream.
so, how was the wedding?
okay. All right.
so, we're standing on top of this beautiful cliff. Uh-huh.
I start looking out into the Pacific, and I think to myself, "Wow. I am about to start my life "with the one I love.
and the only problem was, the one I love was not with me.
she wasn't?
she was not.
so you didn't?
I couldn't.
you couldn't.
I mean, don't we have something extra happening with us?
Danny, I...
what happens when we're not on fake-action and you wake up and realize this is real?
you are the only real thing I've ever had in my life.
Danny, come on, man. I don't...
she's beautiful and she's... I'm not twenty-three.
I'm not that.
she's good, she's very nice, there's only one problem. She's not you.
she's not you.
I have two kids.
I can't just drive them off a cliff. You know?
I love those kids more than anything in the world, Guv'nor.
no, I wanna be with those guys like 23 hours a clay.
what about the other hour?
good job!
that's what I'm talking about.
whatever!
well, everything turned out pretty good for everybody.
squirt got to swim with the dolphins.
Palmer met some tennis player her own age on the plane ride home, who's an even bigger fan of 'N Sync.
and Maggie's about to start a three-week acting class with the actual Dolph Lundgren.
and what happened for me?
well, I'm finally wearing my wedding ring for real.
and now when women ask me about it,
I'm gonna tell them I'm married to a woman who doesn't beat me, doesn't cheat on me, doesn't drink... Well, doesn't drink that much.
and who I'm gonna spend the rest of my life with.
a woman named Katherine.
would you like to dance with your wife, Doctor Maccabee?
Yes, I would, Mrs. Maccabee.
Yeah, it's okay.
one more.
you were right, Soul Patch is going hard on that bass.
what did I tell you? Uh-huh.
Hey. Encore, man. I'm just kidding. Stop.
I get it. It is long and it's gross.
you don't need wind for that thing to swing around.
methamphetamine is a modern-day plague, like locusts, only worse.
if I come back out here again and you're still cooking up that poison...
well, be careful what you're doing in there.
I hear these things blow up all the time.
fire in the hole.
you bastard.
gill was in the back.
you killed Gill.
did my daddy send you?
I told him I was starting a church.
Yeah, and he embraces that, boy, with all his might.
but you don't screw with the man's business.
a meth lab blew up in the woods outside of Harlan.
and the local police there had a c. I. Inside.
he was killed.
so now he's killed someone.
come out of the tent with your hands up!
put your hands up! Come on!
get out! Get out! Now!
get on the ground!
good morning, gentlemen.
please remain facedown with your legs spread until you are told otherwise.
you are now in the custody of the Kentucky state police and the U. S. marshals service.
Raylan, with all this manpower, you looking for Osama Bin Laden, 'cause I'm fair certain he ain't here.
you must be proud.
you made it most of three weeks before murdering someone.
sorry.
Mr. crowder,
captain Choate of the Kentucky state police has identified a parolee in violation of the terms of his release.
all this fuss is over one parole violator?
well, unless you've got something else you'd like to tell me about.
well, they strike the Shepherd so the sheep may scatter.
the Shepherd -- is that you?
come up out of there!
let me see your hands! What the hell you think I'm trying to do?
whoa, whoa, hey.
hold up.
I think I know that voice.
Hey. Looky here.
it's Dewey Crowe.
Luther, you know you're going back to prison.
you got like -- what?
four years left on your bit.
that could easily turn into 10.
you need friends right now, Luther, somebody to go to the a. U. S.A. and the judge and tell them you helped us make a case.
if you do that, we might be able to go to bat for you.
you strike at the Shepherd, that the sheep may scatter.
you strike at the Shepherd, that the sheep may scatter.
they strike at the Shepherd, that the sheep may scatter.
you might strike out the Shepherd, but us sheep, we won't never get struck out. Or scattered.
or words to that effect.
well, Raylan, it seems that we are destined to be locked in an antagonisti
as long as you keep putting yourself in trouble's way.
you gonna introduce me to your friends?
Oh, my mistake. I'm sorry.
Yes, of course.
uh, Art Mullen, the chief deputy of this office.
art's my boss.
I thought you guys had met that night I shot you, but, of course, you were unconscious by the time he showed up.
and this is Detective Frank Choate, Kentucky state police.
we are looking into the homicideof the man blown up in ransom holler.
Mr. Crowder...
we found this in your camp.
we were wondering where all this money came from.
well, there are people in Harlan county who understand the mission of my church and support it with generous donations.
these are donations?
not money you stole from a meth lab before you blew it to shit?
all from grateful souls who want to see me expand my ministry.
well, it's now the property of the marshals service, until such time as you can prove that you came by it honestly, you know, with donation forms and receipts, and I'm sure you've got all that stuff.
well, I've never been good at paperwork, but I'll get right on that.
Boyd, just honestly, are you working for your daddy?
is that what this is, just scaring people back under his wing?
has it ever occurred to everyone sitting at this table that what happened in ransom holler might have been an accident?
Oh, so you didn't mean to burn that boy alive.
well, I'm merely suggesting that the explosion of a meth lab might.
and if a man was killed, well,
I think we may safely claim to see the hand of righteousness in it.
and whose hand would that be -- yours?
only the lord can be righteous.
I make no such claims for myself.
do you know anything about the man you killed?
he was a screw-up, working in a meth lab.
maybe he was trying to turn his life around, do some good.
sure as hell didn't deserve to die like that.
dear friend, death comes to all of us, but if he was truly a man on a righteous road, he is now with our heavenly father.
would you do me a favor...
...and just show me in there where it justifies the killing of innocent people.
you really don't know shit about the heavenly father, do you, Crowder?
it's assholes like you that give Christians like me a bad name.
no, Frank, I got this.
you want to talk about the hand of righteousness.
you're gonna find out what that means.
the kingdom of heaven suffers violence.
violent men take it by force.
is Crowder completely full of shit?
he is, but I just don't know if he believes it or not.
what do we do now - go on back down there to Harlan?
I think our best bet is tracking down the two meth cookers who were in the lab.
if Boyd didn't already kill them and dump their bodies somewhere.
well, exactly, in which case, we have no witnesses.
then I think our best bet is going to Boyd through his father.
one problem we do have.
we don't know the extent of Boyd's old criminal enterprises.
I can help you with that.
all right. Do.
Winona. Hey.
Hi. Raylan.
you just happen to be here?
Um...No, I was looking for you, actually.
what did I do now?
nothing.
no, it was me. I, um...
Um...When I was, uh.
when I was at your motel room the other day, I...
I think I lost my hair clip.
I've looked in the car
I've checked in the car.
Um...Well, I've checked everywhere.
I can't find it.
what's it look like?
um, a hair clip.
what?
you got so many hair clips in your room you need me to.
well, if I see it, I'll let you know.
okay, thanks.
no. - No, go.
Oh, I was, uh... - What were you gonna say?
I was just gonna say thank you, again, for -- for what you did for Gary.
just happy it turned out the way it did.
are you?
I got to go.
I bet you're glad to be back at work, though, huh?
Yeah. I am.
Ooh. - Sorry.
all right. Okay.
I'm real sorry I didn't take your offer that first time around, Boyd.
I mean...Looking back, it
it was a real square deal.
you wasn't thinking straight, was you, Mickey?
I mean, sometimes them chemical vapors, they -- they seep in your pores a-and mess with your brain... G-get you all mixed up.
I ain't too big a man to say I made a mistake or nothing.
we all make mistakes, right, Johnny?
every damn day.
is it too late for us to get your protection now?
never too late.
I'll have my boys look after you.
and don't worry - we'll let bygones be bygones, get you up and running again.
the, uh, rate's gonna be 10.
um, last time you said 5.
you're what they call...
high risk.
are you really in a position to haggle over price?
no, no, no. Of course not.
I...10's fine.
thank you, Boyd. Thank you.
live and learn.
isn't that what they always say?
Yep. - Live and learn.
what?
you sick?
no.
it's that bad, huh?
no, Raylan, living in the hole's a party.
I figure I'll give it a year.
if it don't get no better, I'll take the bedsheet exit.
why are you here?
well, I was hoping you'd give me the lay of the land as far as Boyd Crowder and Harlan's concerned.
so now you want help getting at Boyd when it's because of you he's back on the street.
me? No, no, no, no, no.
Boyd is out because of me.
Boyd is out because of you.
I had a lid on Harlan.
I bet you did.
crime went way down after I came in.
you were on the payroll of a Miami drug cartel.
Yeah, they paid me to let drugs roll through Harlan.
they didn't stop there.
you know, Boyd was the one providing protection for the meth labs.
I put Boyd down, I cut meth in Harlan by half.
I can imagine.
no, I don't think you can, Raylan.
you wouldn't believe the shit I had to deal with.
trying to flush out them snakes, the stoll brothers, spreading their black-tar heroin.
how about Chris Lytle?
do you remember little Chris Lytle?
Chris Lytle the...
little faggot walked in front of the marching band with the stick.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I heard he became a marine.
Yeah, then he came backstarted growing pot from Harlan to the Virginia state line.
trying to stomp him was like playing whac-a-mole.
what was Boyd's involvement in all this?
protection and collection.
Hey, anything's running, he's getting a cut of it.
what about after you put him away?
Johnny take over?
Oh, no.
Boyd assigned his collection duties to Arlo givens.
whose son's a big U. S. marshal?
you know, from what I heard, he did a piss-poor job, too.
ran it right into the ground.
I can't imagine old Boyd's too happy about that.
and YOU?
sir.
morning, sir.
Mr. Crowder.
I seem to recall you making your first tentout of bedsheets and broom handles.
you were about knee-high.
some things never change, huh?
afternoon, daddy.
I always prayed that the lord would guide you into the light.
welcome to the church of the last chance salvation.
you're looking good.
this backwoods lifestyle seems to be suiting you.
I prefer a soft pair of double d's, a 60-inch-wide screen, and a good stiff drink, myself.
is that Hestler Jones?
in the flesh.
well, I ain't seen you in a minute.
when did you get your release?
I forget. It was a day ending in a "y."
well, did you have to go around and tell all your neighbors you're a pervert?
how better for me to see what the new talent is?
that day I came to pick you up at big Sandy and I asked you to work some hours to help me rebuild my business and you said you wanted to walk another path, well, I reacted poorly.
that's why I came too see you today, son, to say I'm sorry, to beg your forgiveness and your indulgence.
what's this?
the smoke from your blast sent a signal across all of Harlan county.
I got people lining up with cash in their hands, begging me for protection.
well, I can't accept this.
why not?
cause I know where it comes from.
the bible tells us that "a gift blinds the wise and perverts the words of the righteous."
well, then let's just consider it an offering, my tithes to your church of the last this, that, or the other.
you're not taking me seriously, daddy, and I don't find that amusing.
you know, it's funny.
I was just about to say the same goddamn thing to you.
I'll send Johnny to tell you where this hand of God will strike next.
you're wasting your time if you think I'm doing anything on your behalf.
whatever you're doing, it's working.
just keep doing it, son.
son of a bitch!
God!
Hello, Raylan.
Helen, this is Art Mullen.
he's my boss.
you got a nice garden, Mrs. givens.
your boss is a liar.
this was his mama's garden.
I promised her I'd take care of it when she was gone.
I have done a god-awful job.
well, it's a lot of work.
hand me that, would you?
Oh. Sure.
Hey, let me ask you something - do you get snails?
whole armies of the little bastards.
you got a cure?
well, I was hoping you did.
I mean, I've tried everything.
I even tried crushing them and stringing them on a line as a lesson to the other snails, but they don't seem to care.
why are you here, Mr. Mullen?
I thought Raylan didn't want nothing more to do with us.
no, we just wanted to have a quick word with your husband.
he's not here.
where is he? Why?
we just -- we needed his advice about something.
his advice?
you thought that would work?
flattery?
Well...Now, it often does.
7 out of 10 times, I'd say.
he's down at the VFW, blowing off steam.
been spending all his time down there lately.
says those vets are the only ones who understand him.
apparently, his wife does not.
well, I wouldn't take it personal.
VFW's the only place he can get a drink in this dry town.
what do you think he's done this time?
no, no, ma'am.
it's nothing like that.
we just wanted to have a quick word with him -- that's all.
you have a nice day.
you've got a beautiful place here.
you know what? Hey.
we know Ario's been running Boyd's protection business when Boyd was in prison.
it never ends with you, does it?
Helen, this ain't personal.
you can lie to yourself all u want, Raylan.
you can put on that hat and that badge and pretend you're someone else, just so you can accept every crazy notion you hear about your father.
are you saying I'm wrong?
this look like the palace of a Harlan county kingpin to you?
I'd say it looks about right, given the fact that Arlo ran Boyd's business into the ground.
I know nothing about that.
he's gonna have to answer for pissing Boyd's money away.
do you understand what I'm saying?
gonna need a new trailer to cook the meth in.
Boyd will get it for you.
can he get us ephedrine?
it's better than buying that cold shit.
Boyd will get you everything you need.
here he is now, boys.
afternoon, soldier sorry, sir, no membership I. D. no entry.
did you see that part down there where it says "U. S. Marshall"?
again, I'm sorry, sir, but it's veterans and their guests only, unless you got a warrant.
are you serious?
listen, my father's inside, named Arlo givens.
would just tell him we need to speak with him?
just a moment.
that's nice stonework.
not if you're trying to bounce a ball off it.
I spent my fair share of time out here, waiting for him.
sorry, sir. I can't help you.
well, I know he's in there.
his truck is right there.
sorry, sir.
Howdy.
we interrupt anything?
I've been off the clock since 5: 00, so...
you drunk?
I was headed in that direction, till this detour.
no admission, huh?
did you try flirting?
he was immune to my charms.
he said heroes only.
Oh, okay.
you show him your ass wound?
no, I didn't think it was that kind of an evening.
evening, soldier.
uh, I didn't bring my cape.
I'm guessing this will suffice?
Rangers, huh?
where did you serve?
afghanistan.
no shit?
we got a boy waiting to ship.
Oh, great.
maybe he can buy me a drink.
how did you get in?
deputy Gutterson served in Afghanistan.
he a mess-hall cook?
sniper in the rangers.
so, he's the shit.
and you?
art Mullen, chief deputy.
have a seat.
the Afghan war, huh?
Yes, sir.
"yes, sir. " I like that. "Yes, sir."
so, what can I do for you all?
we're interested in Boyd Crowder.
isn't he out in the woods uh, running a revival or something?
Yeah, but we want to know if he's helping Bo Crowder and if Bo's reestablishing his businesses.
why would I know any of that?
because you ran Bo's protection-and-collection business while he was in prison.
I what?
you deny it?
hell, yes, I deny it.
that's crazy.
why on earth would Bo do something like that?
okay. We're done here.
Mr. givens, what we need you to consider.
what I'm supposed to say is, "we know you ran Bo's protection racket into the dirt."
so it don't take a prophet to see the future from here.
okay, you can either sit around, waiting to catch a bullet...
...Or...
what?
or you can accept protection from the marshals service.
that's why you're here?
I don't need protection.
yeah? What about Helen?
you gonna forgive yourself if she gets caught in the crossfire, hmm?
you are no longer welcome here...Any of you.
okay.
tell the truth -- you didn't honestly think you could turn me.
I came here as an officer of the law, because sometimes we have to make deals with lowlifes because we have our sights set on life-forms even somehow lower on the ladder of lowlifes than they.
now, Arlo...
use your words.
Mr. givens, we're taking down the Crowders.
and you can either go with them...Or not.
over here.
let me guess - our missing meth cookers.
each with a bullet hole in the back of the head.
Hello, Arlo.
Bo. Thanks for coming.
want a drink?
sure.
what'll you have?
Oh, how about a Singapore sling.
what the hell do you think I'm gonna have?
I don't know.
I'm having some bourbon.
it was a joke, Arlo.
Helen here?
no, she's out. Why?
well, several of the Harlan ladies brought me care packages when they heard I was out.
I've kindly been waiting for Helen to show up at my place with a big basket of something sweet.
I can't remember the last time she baked anything.
well, I can forgive Helen.
why weren't you there to welcome me home?
because I knew how this was gonna go, and I thought it wasn't gonna amount to much.
what happened?
young punks came in, wouldn't show respect.
you should have made them.
and you shouldn't have given the job to an old man.
that's why I picked you.
if I'd have left Johnny in charge, he might have gotten ideas about taking over.
you know your place.
at least I thought you did.
Where's my money?
there is no money.
people stopped paying.
you invited me over here to tell me this?
no, Bo, I invited you over to tell you you have to do something about your son Boyd.
he has gone clear off the deep end.
well, shit, at least he hasn't join the other team, become a goddamn marshal for Christ's sake.
at least Raylan doesn't run around, preaching Jesus and blowing up meth labs.
I got control over my boy.
can you say the same about yours?
he comes to town, it's to ruin the likes of you and me.
only reason my son comes to Harlan is because of your son.
you're gonna give me my money.
how much you want?
$50, 000 to start with.
I don't have that.
how much you got?
nothing.
well, then why did you ask?
being polite.
polite?
well, how about this.
you've got until this time tomorrow to come up with a better answer.
or what?
thanks for the drink.
I'm sorry I missed Helen.
give her my best, huh?
I should have shot him.
or you.
I got one of these for my grandson, Willy.
he loved it.
he used it to terrorize his dog.
you know, those Chinamen - they get a bad rap, what with their history of communist oppression and all.
but without their cheap labor and parts, well, you couldn't get yourself a remote-controlled helicopter for $37. 99.
no, sir.
well, as fascinating as this is, Mr. Lemuel, it's a different Chinese product I came to discuss.
Ah, well.
those are a little harder to come by, and they cost a touch more than $37. 99.
well, I'm aware of that, but I have recently been given a stipend and a benediction that allow me not only to proceed with a full wallet...
but a full heart.
I'll see what I can do.
Aw, shit.
come on, hop in.
hell with it. I'll wait for another car.
what you doing?
I'm hitchhiking. What's it look like?
but what's going on?
I got nothing to say to you.
why aren't you up there at church camp with pastor Boyd and the other commandos?
they ain't Crowder's commandos no more, that's for damn sure.
what do you mean by that?
too much religion.
that's why I left.
I never should have come down.
there's too many rules.
what kind of rules?
Oh, all kinds!
hell, I can't even remember them all. They're from the bible.
they kick you out for breaking one of God's rules?
Yeah, one of them.
one lousy rule - he kicked me out.
well, what did you do - lie? Steal?
dance on Sunday?
he called me an onanist.
bet you don't even know what that is, smartass.
actually, I do.
Yeah, well, I didn't.
how you think that was, Boyd, running me down in front of everybody?
I don't know -- funny?
you go to hell.
I'm just playing.
so he kicked you out for jacking off, huh?!
Hey, Dewey Crowe, you stop right there!
in name of the U. S. marshals service and the government of the United States,
I hereby declare you deputized.
what?
you are now a duly deputized assistant U. S. marshal.
what the hell's that supposed to mean?
it means you either assist me in my investigation or find yourself in violation of section 39b of the U. S. marshal's act, for which you might receive a sentence of not longer than three years in the federal pen.
Oh, bullshit!
that's an abuse of federal power!
well, be that as it may, it is the law.
now, get in the car, or face the consequences.
Boyd really bounced you out of there for spanking the monkey?
you know, flogging the log?
polishing the German helmet?
where you taking me?
what do you mean - where am I taking you?
I'm taking you back to Boyd's.
what?
I was headed there already, but this'll be much better.
you'll have a badge and a gun.
won't be loaded of course.
you got to earn that kind of trust.
you can't take me back there!
what do you mean I can't?
you're a man of the law now.
we're on the same side, Dewey Crowe.
this is bullshit.
you ever hear of the O. K. Corral, hmm?
does that ring a bell?
Yeah.
well, weren't none of those men walking with Wyatt Earp deputized before that moment -- not the day before, not the hour before.
he deputized them right then and there, and they did their job.
they died!
well, that's true.
but they died heroes, huh?
Oh, this just sucks. Will you pull over and let me out?
why did you and Boyd blow up that meth lab?
me?!
that was before I got down here.
ain't you paying attention?
well, you must have heard something.
you know he killed a man sleeping in the back of that place, and now it seems he's killed two other men, as well.
Oh, I know what you're thinking.
only two minutes to the camp.
can't wait to show off your shiny new badge.
he never killed them. He let them go.
why did he blow up the lab?
because he hates meth.
why did he blow up that particular lab?
one of his men used to be a cooker there.
which one?
I can't remember.
try harder.
Oh, Bobby something. Bobby Sue.
Oh, I don't -- will you turn the damn car around?!
gentlemen, this morning, we are looking for Bobby Joe Pecker.
packer. Sorry.
see. We got a warrant and everything.
what, you got him squirreled away in a mine somewhere?
I don't know where he is, Raylan - hopefully out spreading the good word.
Hey, can you ask your friends to be a little more gentle with our belongings?
we don't have much, but we do value what we have.
well, I could, but they're looking for a witness to murder, so I don't think they'll listen.
what does that make it now - four on the list?
what list, Raylan?
the men you murdered.
I got one on a bridge, one in a meth lab, and now these two meth cookers we found dumped in a ditch.
are there more?
you know, Raylan, we are getting precipitously close to the moment
I ask to have my lawyer to be present.
Yeah.
Oh, I think I found out that thing about Arlo you were gonna tell me, that could help me put him away.
he was running your daddy's protection-and-collection business while your daddy was in prison.
was that it?
Yeah, that's it.
that was the deep, dark secret about your daddy I was dangling.
I figured as much.
but do you know who he was running collections with?
wasn't you, was it?
no, it wasn't me.
and the only reason I'm gonna tell you this is 'cause he is well beyond your reach.
now, far be it from me to tell you how to run your affairs.
but you might want to have a word with the woman you are currently bedding.
you see, the man who ran my daddy's collections, along with your father, was Ava's late husband, my deceased brother, Bowman -- God rest his soul.
well, I thought Ava would have told you that.
Bowman? Ava's ex? That's what he said.
well, that could be bullshit, just trying to get you all spun up.
Yeah. Probably.
the last car drove off. The woods are clear.
with alacrity!
let's get him out of here.
come on.
hold on!
man, that was hot!
about cooked!
man, you never told me how you knew they were coming for me.
Dewey called and confessed he broke a confidence.
how was it down there?
I couldn't hear nothing.
I thought you forgot about me.
not for a second.
I appreciate you going down there for me, Bobby.
I truly do.
I'd do anything for you, Boyd.
you saved my soul.
God does the saving, son. I just point the way.
now, Bobby, I'm gonna have to ask for one more favor, and I'm gonna warn you, now, it's a big one.
whatever you want, Boyd.
all right. Come on. Let's go.
Hey, let go of me!
let's go. Come on.
no.
what?
what the hell are you doing here?
I'm drinking.
what are you doing back in Harlan?
well, this isn't Harlan.
you see, Harlan's dry.
you must have missed the silence.
this is Corbin.
you got a death wish?
this is as good a place as any for you to interrogate me about my dead husband.
I wasn't interrogating you.
I just wanted to ask you a few questions.
ask.
this is not the place or the time.
why not? Isn't that why you called?
it wasn't to check up on me.
it wasn't to ask me what I was wearing in that sweet voice of yours.
well, okay, then, let's just get it out in the open.
you want to know whether bowman worked for Bo.
you lower your voice.
can I ask you something, Raylan?
um, you thought that bowman was some big-time criminal, and I just forgot to mention that to you?
we can discuss that in the car.
Oh, well, it's okay.
I'll find my own ride home.
you are beautiful and drunk.
but on account of that target Bo's got on your back, none of these boys are gonna get within 20 feet of you.
that's not true.
um, Hestler over there - he'll take good care of me.
won't you, Hestler.
who's that?
Oh, you don't remember Hestler Jones?
he was the creepy kid who used to, you know, sit in the bleachers and smile his creepy little smile?
he just did eight years in the state pen for statutory rape.
he working for Bo?
that would be my guess. He's been following me around.
Raylan givens. How you been?
what brings you here, Hestler?
having a drink.
Ava says you've been following her around.
it's a small world down here. Maybe you forgot.
people run into each other all the time.
she's just imagining I'm following her.
we all have imaginations, don't we?
differentiates us from the beasts.
I, for one, imagine all sorts of things.
Ow. That hurt.
all right.
Oh, no doubt a violation of your parole.
you think that's the only gun I can get my hands on?
probably not.
ow, you broke my finger, you son of a bitch!
won't be able to pull the trigger now, will you?
okay. We're leaving.
no, no, no, I'm staying.
I still got my left hand, asshole!
I'm not leaving you in a bar with a rapist.
I'm a big girl, Raylan.
I've been taking care of myself long before you rode into town on your white horse.
all right, listen to me.
you are leaving with me if I have to arrest you and put you in handcuffs.
holy shit! Yeah.
she's not dead, is she?
I hope not.
I was just driving along, and she passed out.
did you put handcuffs on her? Yeah.
she wouldn't listen to reason.
I need her to stay at your place tonight.
why don't you take her back to your luxury motel?
did you screw things up with her?
what do you think?
what's going on?
there have been threats, from the Crowder family.
is she in danger?
nothing that could be drawn back to you or Gary.
I just need to convince her to get out of Kentucky.
and you think dumping her handcuffed at your ex-wife's house, that's gonna do the trick?
what about you?
what about me? You getting out of Kentucky?
I already tried that.
are you gonna drive closer to my house, or do you expect me to carry her from here?
you gonna take those handcuffs off her? I could.
but you might regret that.
what in the hell?
how's it feel to rip off your own damn wife?!
I didn't steal anything.
you snatched every single dollar I saved!
I had to take care of things.
why didn't you have the balls to ask me before you took my money?!
your money?
you haven't had a goddamn job in 20 years!
what are you doing, digging it up now, anyway?
you finally looking to leave me?
I damn well should.
look, Helen, I planned on filling it up again.
Arlo, that money was gonna buy us some time.
you okay?
no, Arlo, I'm not okay!
we need to pack up and get out.
nobody's gonna run me out of Harlan.
Arlo, unless you got $50, 000 I don't know about, we got two options.
we either run or you kill Bo.
welcome back, my friend, to the show that never ends.
put your bag down.
I appreciate you giving me the heads up on Raylan.
we took care of the Bobby Joe situation in the Nick of time.
well, where is he? He's performing a great service.
so, did Raylan rough you up a little bit?
I know he has before. No.
well, how did he get you to talk, then?
he deputized me. He did what?
he said he could deputize me, and then I had to talk.
Oh, that Raylan givens. He sure is a clever one.
well, you know that's not true, right?
I wasn't sure.
no, you didn't have to talk.
but I'm sure you wanted to.
no, I didn't.
not even after I humiliated you?
I regret that, Dewey...
friend.
that was out of line.
Yes, you broke our rule against self-pleasuring, but...
I should not have embarrassed you like that in front of the others.
so, I understand why you talked to deputy Givens -- I do.
and I forgive you, Dewey.
thank you, Boyd.
thank.
but I can't abide it.
I'm sorry, son, but the work we're doing here is too important.
I hope you understand.
I don't -- I don't understand.
you can't kill someone for jerking off!
go.
I could stay.
I promise not to spank it so much.
excuse me, sir?
he said he had to come up here.
Yeah, hey, boss.
that's me.
I come up here to tell y'all I'm the one that set fire to that trailer.
wasn't nobody but me -- not Boyd, not nobody from the church, just me.
and I asked God's forgiveness.
he told me to surrender, so here I am.
well, I say if you're gonna be a bear, be a grizzly.
but this, my friends, is a Kodiak.
Hello?
Hello, Raylan.
Winona, do you know what's going on here?
I'm being framed of a murder I didn't commit.
I Found the gun. -Thank you.
this time, seriously, don't come find me.
go tell your boss I got the gun that killed Gary. -Do you?
ask him where he thinks it might turn up. -You have no ide... ooh!
what are you gonna do?
make sure Ellen May don't get hurt.
thanks for coming by, Raylan.
what brings you to Lexington?
I just wanted to let you know Boyd Crowder is backing a man for sheriff.
you came all this way to tell me that. -I likes to back the winning side.
I'm gonna want to know what Mr. Quarles is up to.
I believe you can help me out there.
you need someone who know his way around Harlan.
I got the sheriff. -Someone who ain't the law.
Oh, so what I need is a federal fugitive who assaulted a U. S. marshal.
I don't think so.
Mr. Quarles, sir, I will do anything to make it right.
you were supposed to wait until I get back in the house before you set that thing off.
you get me what you owe me, or next time, I won't even wait for you to get out of the car.
Rachel said you wanted to see me. -Yes, come in.
shut that door behind you. -This isn't good.
no. - I'll be gentle.
who's Brady Hughes?
you been checking up on me?
Yes. Duh.
who is he? Switchboard said that yesterday you got an anonymous call that said, "tell deputy Givens to ask Quarles about Brady Hughes.
all I can tell you is what I got when I ran the name through the database, which I'm not gonna share with you cause.
I know you already did the same.
what does Quarles want with a missing hustler?
he just about killed one in Detroit. -So, what?
you went down there to where Brady? -Yeah.
and then you asked them all if anybody had seen him with Quarles?
none of the other rent boys were too anxious to speak.
what do you have on Quarles? -What do I have on Quarles?
Yeah. -What have we been talking about?
what do you have on Quarles right now that you can prove?
that's what I thought. Look, we're gonna shut this down.
shut what down?
you and Quarles . us and Quarles.
cause no matter how big a scumbag he is, until he runs afoul of federal law enforcement, - he's not marshal business. -He tried to destroy my life.
and even if he was marshal business, he wouldn't be yours.
you're gonna have to step back now.
you got it?
don't hog it all! -I'm not.
don't get your panties in a twist. All right. Golly.
there's plenty for everybody. Just hurry your asses up.
you want us to be pumped, don't you?
no, what I want is for you to go out and make me some goddamn money.
you bitches ready? It's showtime.
everybody get down on the ground!
you too! Are you deaf?!
Aw, shit!
J. J. open the door! Open the door!
I got her, J. J! I got her! Come on!
Aw, shit! -Go, go!
he grabbed my gun!
there was nothing I could do!
she... she's right. It happened so fast.
God damn it! You kill anybody?!
I don't know. Krystal shot back at him.
took off half his skull. The clerk took a bullet, too.
Aw, shit. -It's okay, baby-poo!
Oh, my God. We're gonna get you help.
Oh, no, n no, no!
Oh, no! -What?
Oh, no, no, no! -What?!
no, no, no!! -She's dead.
you shut up! -Ellen May, shut her up!
or hand to God, I'll run this van right off a goddamn cliff! -Shut up! Shut up!
you got to shut up right now. You got to shut up.
all right.
now, it's terrible what happened to Krystal, huh?
don't make it worse by losing your shit. That's the last thing she'd want.
the last thing she'd want is to have her guts spilling on the ground.
krystal was a soldier. She knew the risks.
and she'd want us to, you know, soldier on, huh?
wouldn't she?
wouldn't she?! -Yes.
I suppose. -All right.
let's fix this.
for Krystal, huh?
I could use a pill.
now, that's more like it. Yeah.
ask and ye shall receive.
can't we just bury her? -No darling.
we need the slurry to eat her up.
couple days, there'll be nothing left of her.
she deserves better than this.
you got something to say, Ellen May?
no. All right. Best not.
go on. Toss her in.
well, what do we do now?
we cover our tracks.
Ava Crowder... just what my day has been missing.
bet you feel like all I do lately is ask you favors, but...
Raylan, if you just give me...
for you, I got all the time in the world.
so, you're saying you ended it this time?
I'm saying I played a big part.
Elmer T. Lee single barrel, water back. -I just asked for a whiskey.
friends of the deputy get top-shelf.
hm. She clearly has a crush on you.
are we talking about the bartender? -She is awful pretty...
if you're into that sort of thing.
little long in the tooth to be dressed like that, though.
I'm willing to forgive her. Boyd tells me you shot a woman.
are you two still close?
what was that like? - Different?
I can't say what it's like to shoot anybody, Ava.
as a rule, women aren't into crimes where they get shot by people in law enforcement, so we don't get that many opportunities to shoot women.
well, if a person's holding a gun at you, doesn't matter if they're wearing a dress.
she was wearing pants.
Boyd the reason you're here? He is.
still think you can change him, huh? Not trying to change him.
I'm trying to help him.
what?
I'm reminded of a fugitive we were chasing...
a big fella named Tiny.
found out he was stepping out on his wife with this pretty sorta-rican girl.
we knock on her door. She answers in a see-through number.
my boss says "where's Tiny?" And then she says, "he ain't here.
and he says, "if he's here and you're lying, you're going to jail.
she says, "he's in the back.
you understand?
it wasn't like she was hurting him or telling on him.
there was just nothing she could do for him, so she said, "yeah,
he's in the back.
did you catch him?
you do know what Boyd is, right?
I mean, you do know.
he says he can help you get to Robert Quarles.
then why didn't he come down here and tell me himself?
well, I knew if anybody could sweet-talk you into coming to see me, it'd be Ava.
I hope you had a pleasant time, but not too pleasant.
well, I'm here. That's the main thing.
what do you got for me?
the man who did the shooting out at your - aunt Helen's house... man with a limp... - You know him?
well, I believe he's Robert Quarles' point person in Harlan.
he tried to turn Devil against me. You gave him the limp.
well, I can get territorial. How is Devil?
I haven't seen him.
well, he's calmed down a good bit since last you saw him.
and what's in this for you?
well, the man you threw out of that trailer happens to be,
I believe, the same man who committed the crime for which I find myself currently incarcerated.
you're asking me to go find your "get out of jail free" card.
let's think of it this way.
now, you find this guy, you get your man Quarles, and you get to help out an old friend.
now, that's a win-win.
you got a name?...
now, just exactly where did this information come from?
Oh, Tom Bergen and his boys. They been down here rattling the bushes.
fella name of Tanner Dodd popped up.
Bergen, huh?
you say his source is solid?
100%. He's a known scumbag.
I ain't surprised at all to hear he's the same fella I threw out of the trailer.
all right. Go get your fugitive.
all right. - Will do.
Hey, Raylan.
you ever hear of a fella named Tanner Dodd?
you want me to frisk him? Nah, that ain't necessary.
I told him we were all pals up here now.
have a seat, Mr. Quarles. You hungry?
uh... No, thank you. I've eaten.
you sure?
hell, Bernard's little, pretty mama make the best shoofly pie I ever ate.
you ever had shoofly pie?
no, but judging by the name, I'm sure it's delicious.
molasses. Mmm.
butter, brown sugar.
my, that sure am sweet!
indeed.
and, like all sweet things, it draws pests.
hence "shoofly.
Mr. Limehouse, I'm sure you didn't invite me up here to discuss the sociology of baked goods.
well, last we spoke, you said you had a plan for this county included the election.
of course. I'm from Detroit.
elected officials are always part of the business plan.
are you on board?
I am... Just as soon as you tell me who your campaign manager is.
excuse me? For the election.
no, no, no, no, no. I heard you.
I just don't understand why I need one.
Crowder's in jail, Napier's a hero. It's as good as won.
now, I'm sure it seems like that from the outside, but 'round here, elections ain't won without insurance.
and no doubt you'll be adding that "insurance" to my tab.
fraid I don't make donations 'less they tax-deductible.
now, is that gonna be a problem?
open the box.
no.
it's not gonna be a problem. Good.
then you can give that box right there to your new campaign manager.
and where do I find this fella?
he gonna be in my seat in about 10 minutes.
Mr. Quarles.
we're not open!
Christ, we're not the only place in town to get a drink!
Ava, I prayed you'd be here.
please... please, you got to help me.
thank God you're here! Come on! Mrs. Dodd?
hurry up! I think he's gonna kill her.
who is? Vincent.
where is he? He's in the woods.
see, he was hunting, and he shot what he thought was a deer.
but it wasn't. It was Bernice.
she was spying on him.
well, at least I think it was Bernice.
see, it could have been her evil twin sister, Eloise.
problem is, I could not see the beauty mark on the TV.
Mrs. Dodd, is there anyone in the house with you? No. That's why I need you.
I've got something I need to discuss with you.
well, I ain't discussing nothing until you help me get this TV working.
Mrs. Dodd? Now, hold that up high.
Mrs. Dodd. No, call me Imogene.
and hold that up nice and high. I'm sorry, Imogene.
no, wait. What? I'm not here to help you with your TV.
I'm here because I'm looking for your boy Tanner.
I haven't seen him in years. I don't think that's true.
I think you saw him the other day, when he brought over that brand-new TV.
he brought it because he loves his mama.
only, he didn't have a chance to hook it up, did he?
no. Because he's in trouble.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I - Think you do.
I know you love your boy and you don't want to see him get in any more trouble, but you should know... I'm not the only one looking for him.
there are some very dangerous men after him, too. Really?
and don't you think it would be best if I found him first?
so you could help him? That's right.
Oh, that would be so good.
did you ever think of trying the one where he accidentally ingested poison and you're the only one with the antidote?
excuse me?
look, the first time some no-dick lawman came around and ran that game with me,
Tanner was 10 years old.
now you get the hell out
Yes, ma'am.
in case you change your mind.
now, we'll concentrate our first haul here 'cause if you ain't got Vernon creek, you ain't gonna win.
now, that is, unless you got Jameston holler.
now, once we make sure they vote right, we give them each a playing card to exchange for the booze.
now, personally, I like to use a face card 'cause they're more distinct to a deck, makes it harder for people to bring in their own...
excuse me, Harvey?
aren't I paying you to do this for me?
well, yeah.
Oh, but... but I take pride in my work.
I like people to understand the services I am providing.
a- a-and this town-hall-debate circle jerk?
well, that's vfw. That ain't town hall.
you know, we gonna have to tread light with that, too.
no, I'm serious.
as many times as votes been rigged for these people, they're pretty quick to spot a fix when they see one.
you know, I got to be honest with you, Harvey... I'm not sure
I'm understanding the services you're providing on that one.
well, we make sure that, uh, Napier scores, and, uh, then I just gavel out before Shelby can even respond.
now...
as I was saying, a face card gets a bottle.
the more status a person has, the bigger bottle they get.
I found that works, you know?
how long's he gonna be in there? Relax.
they're almost done.
Hey, ma... what?
shit.
okay.
I love you, too.
I got a problem.
Tanner's mama says the marshal's been coming around looking for him.
he's thinking of running.
he got any unfinished business could come back on us?
I don't know. "I don't know.
that's an acceptable answer if I ask you why the sun come up each day or why God chose to give man dominion over the animals.
but if I ask you if your friend Tanner left any loose ends that could point probing fingers back at this holler, you say, "no," you understand me?
Yes, sir, Mr. Limehouse.
now, you go with Tanner, and you make sure he ties things in a tight, little bow before he take flight...
else we have our own unfinished business to tend to.
Yeah.
it has been an honor and a privilege to serve the people of this county.
come in. Sheriff Napier.
u. S. Marshal Raylan Givens. What can I do for the marshals office?
this is special agent Masters, A. T.F. A. T.F?
you know, I never understood why it's not A. T.F. E.
E" is what brought us here - - The recent bombing of your car.
well, that case was closed. We have the man who set the device in custody.
our concern is that Crowder may have not acted alone, may have had an accomplice
a fella named Tanner Dodd. Never heard of him.
well, his name's come up in a number of bombing investigations.
so, Masters checked out your car this morning.
he what? On whose authority?
president, congress, United States of America.
anyway, sure enough, uh, the rigging device, it matched Tanner's M. O.
we're... we're pretty confident Boyd Crowder acted alone.
agent Masters is one of the best. That why he doesn't talk, doesn't smile?
just stands in my doorway like a big, hot, steaming pile of shit?
social awkwardness is often the curse of genius.
anyway, you get a line on this guy Dodd, we're gonna want to talk to him as soon as possible.
you give us a call if you do, okay? Mm-hmm. Count on it.
pleasure.
good luck with that speech.
I did good, didn't I? You did.
Hey, man, uh, you want to grab a beer or something?
Ah, it's a little early in the morning for me.
Plus, I'd like you to get going before the sheriff spots you, wonders why a bomb tech drives a big rig.
my vest? Oh, yeah.
sorry.
take it easy, buddy
might be a little ragged, but it's clean.
there we go.
music always helps me take my mind off things.
Ava, I can... I can't... - It's okay, honey.
you just relax. Yeah.
maybe even get a little sleep.
Ava! It's okay! It's okay!
you're safe.
you're okay.
why was the damn door locked? Should have been open an hour ago.
Johnny. Ellen May's here.
Delroy's girl?
said Delroy killed another girl and she's gonna be next.
look, Ava, I know you got a big heart and you're always bringing in broken things, trying to make them well, but she ain't a stray kitten.
you can't keep her.
I was thinking that maybe you'd take her in.
might do you good having a woman around the house.
that's what you were thinking, huh?
that is very sweet of you, Ava.
but, uh...
I always wanted a blonde.
go back there and look at her, how messed up she is.
look, it's not about that. This is just business, okay?
Delroy pays us protection money. She does not.
you got to turn her over. He'll kill her.
that's what she told you, but she's an oxy addict.
how do you know she's not here scheming you for more pills or money or some shit?
Boyd is in jail again.
and we don't know for how long.
and in the meantime, everyone's got to just make their own way.
you and me, we got to take care of each other.
all right. "All right" what?
I'll turn her in.
that's what Boyd would do. I don't believe you.
who's this?
Delroy. It's Ava Crowder.
ms. Crowder, this ain't such a good time.
I got your girl.
which girl? You know which one.
you want her back, you're gonna have to bring me a little something for my trouble.
I already pay Boyd protection.
well, Boyd didn't find her... I did.
and I charge a finder's fee.
how's two grand sound? Sounds like I don't have a choice.
you don't. It was a pleasure doing business with you.
believe me now?
well, how much did you pay for the explosives?
five grand. Why?
you might as well get your money back before you pop him.
hold up.
Yeah, what do you want? I just want to give you what I owe you.
yeah? What brought you to your senses?
well, that's a lot of money.
takes time to gather, is all.
how about I come by your place tonight?
well, actually, I think you ought to stay out of sight.
how about, uh, how about we meet?
meet at pine top in two hours.
fine.
looks like I'm about to double my money.
back for more?
not exactly.
I need a refund.
Oh, so that's how it is. Pretty much.
well, money's in the back, on top of the green cabinet.
after you.
as you like it.
you do anything squirrely, you get a bullet in the back of your head.
it's up there.
what was that? Whoa, son.
you best don't move... else we're all dead.
bullshit. You ever heard of a bouncing Betty?
a what? It's a goddamn land mine!
that's right.
in Vietnam, I've seen them cut men in half.
I got this one rigged so that it don't bounce.
less damage to my shop.
don't make any difference to you.
well, turn it off. Turn it off right goddamn now!
son, you shoot me now, you'll spend the rest of your life in this room.
I'm the only one that can disarm it.
and I will, but not until you boys hand over your weapons.
both of them. Shit.
you goddamn son of a bitch!
choice is yours, son.
I put down my gun, I won't blow up?
not if you do it slow.
God damn, Errol!
what did you do that for?! Sorry, man.
I got my own loose ends to clean up.
you try to leave, I will shoot you.
I don't think you want to do that. Now I'm the only one who knows about this here predicament.
unless you gonna call the cops, you need me to go and look for somebody to turn that bad boy off.
bullshit.
you're not gonna tell anyone where I'm at.
you're gonna leave me here to either blow up or spend the rest of my life in prison.
how about I step off this thing right now... take you with me?
you could.
but won't be no one left to make sure your mama don't fall to no harm.
now, you let me walk out of that door right there, I'll take that bag of cash to her, make sure she don't never want for anything as long as she lives.
you got Mr. Limehouse's word on that.
Givens.
Raylan, we found Tanner.
you did? How?
believe it or not, he called us.
how's he doing?
not so good.
he's over at Lemuel Briggs' place, standing on a land mine.
unbelievable.
see you in a bit.
sheriff. I'm pretty certain he ain't coming.
wake up.
I can't believe I actually slept.
here. Drink this.
Thanks.
Yeah.
put this around your wrists.
go on. - Wait!
tighten it up.
no... what did I do? No, please.
I need you to stand up.
what did I do? No!
walk to the door, Ellen May. No, please! I'm sorry!
no, please.
open the door. Please don't make me do this.
open the door, Ellen May!
shut up! - Walk!
Hey, darling. No, no, no, no, no! Please!
please, Ava! No, please! He's gonna kill me!
shut up!
please! He's gonna... - I got to tell you to shut up again, I'll shoot you myself!
satisfied?
Yeah, ALL RIGHT
all RIGHT
see, darling, you got to understand, business is always gonna triumph...
help me clean this up.
Raylan, you know Keaton from A. T.F.
happy you're here. Not sure I am.
LEMUEL Briggs is one crafty son of a bitch... knows explosives better than most of my techs. I ain't going near that thing.
he still armed? Yeah.
he's afraid to put his gun down... says the weight change might set it off.
knowing Lemuel, he might not be wrong.
make sure all communications are off.
Tanner. Marshal.
I need you to drop that gun. Can't.
LEMUEL said if I move, I blow up.
well, you raise it, the situation's gonna be a lot simpler.
I ain't raising shit.
can't even hardly feel my arms. Damn, that's a nice setup.
can you defuse it?
of course.
it's gonna take a few hours. No way, man.
you got to work faster than that.
my legs are about to give out, and I got to piss like a racehorse.
all right, take it easy, Tanner. He's working on it.
how about you take this time to tell me about your boss, huh?
how about you get me the hell out of here?! You know, I just left your friend Napier.
he was waiting for you in a secluded spot with a shovel and a rope.
what was that about?
you guys doing some gardening?
did Quarles order the car bombing? I don't know what you're talking about.
come on, Tanner.
we already got you on multiple murders, not to mention assaulting a federal officer.
and, although I haven't done forensics yet, I'm pretty sure that's a dead body at your feet there.
now, why don't you tell me something that'll make life easier for you down the road?
are you trying to cut a deal with me when I'm standing on a land mine?
no better time. Shit.
you're just like your mama.
she okay? She is.
she misses you.
tell you what... you help me out, we get you out of here,
I'll take you by her place, you can help her set up her TV, huh?
ey, you get me off this thing, I'll tell you anything...
Quarles, Napier, whoever. No.
you tell me right now, or Keaton and I are gonna take a lunch break.
I'm a little hungry. Bullshit.
Quarles ordered the hit on the oxy clinic?
my legs are giving out, man, and my hands are sweating rivers!
did he kill Gary? You need to chill out, pal.
Oh, shit!
you sit tight. What happened? What'd I do?
Oh, you're gonna be fine.
I'm just gonna go get the robot. Oh, no, no, no, man.
we need to get out of here.
he needs to tell me what I... come on, man!
God damn it! Did Quarles kill Gary?
everybody get back!
Keaton, what the hell's going on?
the thing armed itself. Armed itself?
are you saying that thing's gonna go off? It's hard to say.
but if the thing arms itself, you get the hell...
since I've been in office, violent crime in this county's down almost 12%.
now, Washington's always trying to fix something that ain't broke.
but I like to think down here, we know better.
rebuttal?
way I understand it, violent crime is down all over.
Mr. Shelby, I believe you'll want to argue against me.
now I will remind both candidates to please not interrupt or address each other directly.
Yes, sir, but given Mr. Shelby's lack of experience, I'm trying to help him understand the concerns of the local community I was a lawman for 20 years.
and now you work at the mega-shop as a greeter.
there's nothing wrong with honest work.
odd you would mention honest work, being as how you lost your security job after a robbery in which you were suspected of being the inside man.
that's enough.
now... next question.
I got a question.
uh... Mr. Moderator, this man is a convicted felon.
we don't let felon vote in this state, do we?
well, I didn't come here to vote.
you wouldn't be here at all if it weren't for the fact that a few hours ago, friends of yours in the federal law enforcement field saw fit to intervene in our local affairs, forced us to release him from the cell he's been occupying since his cowardly attempt on my life.
well, Mr. Napier, I'd like to think that if I was behind an attempt on your life, at the very least, I would have messed up your hair.
all right, now.
what's your question there, Boyd? Uh, thank you, Harvey.
my question is, does Mr. Napier know the name of the company that fired Shelby from his security job?
well, I'll save you the trouble.
the name of that company was Black Pike Coal.
now, do you want us all to believe that Shelby here's a dishonest man because Black Pike tells us so?
do you think that Shelby's the only man in this room been done wrong by a coal-mining company?
Mr. moderator, how many questions you gonna let this convict ask?
Mr. Napier, everybody here knows that the only men the company doesn't do wrong are company men.
and you stand up there with your slick haircut.
you look down on Shelby because this man works for a living.
you talk down to me because I've been in trouble with the law.
well, you know when that trouble began?
why don't you ask your good friend Harvey Jones? He was there.
he was on the line when we struck out at Eastover...
trying to run us over in their cars!
and I know that you weren't there, Mr. Napier.
but there sure were a lot of men there who looked like you.
men standing on the company side, laughing at all us hillbillies who were just trying to stand up for what we believed in.
now, I'm not saying you're a bad man, Mr. Napier.
that, I don't know.
but what I do know is that you've been feeding too long at the public trough.
now, I don't know about the rest of you, but I'm gonna say no to the company man. No!
I'm gonna say no to the lawmen who disrespect the rights of the people whose taxes pay for their salaries!
and I'm gonna say no... I'm gonna say no... I'm gonna say no to sheriff Tillman Napier, who laughs in our faces while he makes money off our backs!
here's to sheriff Shelby.
Oh, you got to like the sound of that.
well, let's not get ahead of ourselves here, son. Oh, come on.
no one's gonna vote for that son of a bitch now. He's right, cousin Johnny.
Harlan county elections ain't over till the dead have voted.
but I will allow... We've had a very good day.
baby can I have a word?
uh, yes, baby... right after we finish this round.
uh, you want to join us? I'm good.
and, uh, sooner's better.
uh, well, sooner it is.
boys.
here?
in... in that bar, where, uh... Where all them...
them people are standing?
Yeah, but you ain't got to worry about that, because me and Ellen may, we cleaned up every drop.
we even got out stains been there 10 years.
Where's Delroy now?
well, he's stinking up an old splinter shaft out past Neary holler.
um... uh, well, Ava, I appreciate your thoroughness, but now, um, you understand that, uh, well, that Delroy was under our protection.
I know, but buying protection doesn't entitle him to bring his mess to our front door like that.
and...
Boyd, you didn't see Ellen May. She was scared.
she was scared as a jackrabbit running from a wildcat.
you know what, baby?
if that's the decision you felt you needed to make, well, then I respect it.
good.
cause I was also thinking... - In Delroy's absence, someone's gonna need to keep them girls from getting swallowed up from some other animal.
well, now, that - - That is very true.
uh, but what about your "no whores" policy?
well, I wasn't talking about you.
Oh, I'm... I'm sorry...
who were you talking about?
me.
ms. Dodd.
got something for you. From Tanner.
Thanks, Errol.
if you need anything, you let me know?
I will.
thank you, Errol.
you're welcome. Bye.
thank you, Imogene.
I'm gonna let myself out the back.
and I truly am sorry for your loss.
why didn't you say grace? Because he's bad?
I simply forgot it, dear. Aren't you supposed to say grace with bad people?
marshal.
kitchen's closed, but I might could whip up something if you're desperate. Closed, huh?
funny... I was just thinking I might have to do the same thing.
what's that?
close you down... For what?
I see to it myself... my kitchen's so clean that the virgin mother herself would eat off of it.
Ellstin, you think for a minute you could cut out that country-bumpkin, barbecue-king bullshit?
you'd rather talk pig shit?
close.
that supposed to mean something to me?
I'm either gonna put him in prison or in the ground.
well, I'm sure you got your reasons, marshal. Not sure how I fit in.
you're gonna help me.
I would if I could, but, like I said, I don't know any Quarles.
Quarles' point man in Harlan county got blowed up today.
a few hours later, I watched your boy Errol pay the grieving mother.
tell me again that you don't know Robert Quarles.
I'm sorry, marshal. I lied to you.
I Know you did.
no, not just now. I mean before, when I said I did not remember your daddy.
I do remember him.
truth is, I remember every shot I gave him, the way his blood felt on my hands, the crying sound he made when I was laying in on him, and just when the sound was about to stop, he was on his way out... I was gonna finish him off...
and looked up and saw you looking...
eyes big as dollar coins.
you was about to pee down your little pants leg.
well, if you thought that memory was gonna upset me,
I'm sorry to disappoint.
well, if you like, I can tell you what I remember about your mama.
that would upset me.
you must know why Quarles is down here.
there's a war coming.
you really want to see Nobles become a battleground?
I appreciate your concern, marshal.
I really do.
but plenty of kings have tried to lay claim on Nobles holler, and none have ever succeeded.
thanks to you and your family. That's right.
that's what you're doing, huh? Just protecting this holler?
right now, I'm just trying to close up for the night.
so be it.
so be it.
you got a sonogram picture taped to your bathroom mirror.
I'm not married, if that's what you're wondering. - She kicked you out.
there's supposed to be $3 million in here, Limehouse.
way north of $3 million. - It's all spent, except what you see right there.
I believe the terms of the deal are I receive the money and then we are through, ain't that right?
that's right. Those are the terms.
then you take it back. - I'm gonna kill you, Raylan.
maybe not tonight, maybe not tomorrow, but some day, you'll be walking down the street, and I'm gonna put a bullet right in the back of your skull, and you're gonna drop.
why wait?
so we're clear...The other night, you throw down the gauntlet to a trigger-happy U. S. Marshal, and this morning, you remember you have pressing business out of town?
I told you... I'll be back in a couple hours.
and what if Givens comes by, wanting to finish the game?
you may tell him that he is welcome to wait.
you know, you disappoint me, Wynn.
word around the Detroit campfire is that you were a wild man.
comes to a little nut-cutting, suddenly you want to bitch out.
don't be like the rest of them.
you can't have the Duffy without the Wynn.
I'll see you in a couple of hours.
Hey. Morning.
just, uh, getting some coffee, and then I'll... - You can take a seat.
no, I don't... Want to be in your way.
you're setting up. - No, I'm not.
okay.
if I had eggs, I'd make you breakfast. - Well, thank you.
you want a shot in that?
uh, I usually like to wait till the sun's all the way up.
it's afternoon somewhere.
listen, Lindsey... - stop.
you don't even know what I'm gonna say.
I think you're gonna apologize again for not giving me a full accounting of every second of your life before you heartlessly accepted the gift of my feminine virtue.
well, when you put it that way, I guess don't owe you an apology.
first time you came in here, I knew you were going through something.
to tell you the truth, I felt a little bad taking advantage of you.
Really? - I mean, not so bad, I don't plan on doing it again.
listen, Lindsey... - you said that already.
I'm about to become a father. - I know. I saw the sonogram.
it's a good-looking kid.
it's got its daddy's eyes. An unfortunate nose, though.
that must be your ex's.
I'm gonna get some limes in the back.
I won't be a sec.
sorry, guys. We're closed.
heard you had a little mischief in here the other night.
well, I wasn't aware that made the news.
we had a friend who was here. - He tell you about the hot wings?
this friend of ours... I'm betting you wouldn't forget him.
he looks like he even shits blond.
I don't suppose you two fellas are from Detroit, are you?
that's a hell of a guess. - Where you buy your suit?
gallo's on Michigan Avenue? - I don't buy suits.
boss buy them for you? - Our boss doesn't buy us anything.
when I first saw him, he was wearing this little gray sharkskin number...
made him look like a kid playing a gangster in a school play.
we don't work for that gentleman.
you work for his daddy. So, what?
Theo Tonin decided little Sammy overstepped when he cut Quarles off, decided to send some new muscle instead?
hence, you two knuckleheads. - You don't want to take that tone.
why is that, champ?
I get the impression they only keep you around so little Sammy doesn't feel like the biggest asshole in the room.
I was just telling these guys we're closed.
and I believe they were leaving.
another time, then.
good. See?
there's gonna be another time.
I'll clean that up.
firing a shot in the air in a crowded bar.
that could be a hiccup. - Yeah. Let's see.
you knew that you had to get the patrons out of harm's way, and they'd already failed to heed your order to evacuate.
you knew that there was nothing above you but your own empty apartment, so you fired a shot in the air, even though you knew it was against marshal's policy, because you thought it was the only thing they would hear above the music.
write it like that. - Thanks, Art.
well, good news is, now we have a nice federal charge against Mr. Quarles.
we just start with the bartender, and we round up some of the other...
bartender doesn't make a good witness.
what's wrong with him? - Her.
Oh, Jesus, Raylan. - It doesn't matter, Art.
we want Quarles for more than this piddly shit.
threatening a federal officer is more than piddly shit.
we had Dickie Bennett for actually trussing up an officer, trying to brain him with a Louisville slugger.
how'd that work out? - Look, Raylan, just pick him up, alright?
we got patrons in there we can use as witnesses.
if we don't have Quarles threatening you, we just got you firing shots into the ceiling.
wait just a second. - Why?
I thought it was a top priority that I go bring in Quarles for the capital punishment of hurting my feelings.
it is, but the son of a bitch is threatening your life.
I can't let you go by yourself. - Tim and Rachel are at Tramble.
you honestly expect me to wait for them?
no.
no way. - Way.
you want I should open it up? Might not be the wisest idea given the surroundings.
well, am I gonna see a little something-something in there I haven't seen before?
maybe something that might make me the Harlan millionaire I was always meant to be.
you'll see 46 and change. Plus a couple of receipts.
is that right? Receipts, too.
I tell you what... you can just leave that shit shut, brother.
you still not gonna take it, huh?
Oh, now, I will.
I will take it... just as soon as it starts adding up to everything I'm rightfully owed.
you understand?
till then, you know, you can't really blame me for wanting a real good reason to hold my head up when I try to explain to people why it is that Ellstin Limehouse somehow sees fit to cheat me out of my family's fortune.
much as you know Mr. Limehouse, you really want it to get back to him that you're running your mouth on his reputation?
think him the type to sit still for something like that?
is that the best you got, sister?
whatever you decided with the cooler,
Mr. Limehouse said to give you the ride back home.
well, that is just... that's real considerate.
but I'll tell you what... I think I'm just gonna have these bastards call me a cab, you know?
the least they could do. You know what I'm saying?
real good to see you.
what do you think's in the cooler? - Probably not a human head.
Mm. That'd be cool.
if you're here to talk about running me in the special election, there's some things we gonna straighten out first.
such as? - Such as, this is staying my office.
no more talk about putting me in a broom closet.
I guess if I were to offer to back yet another of your campaigns,
I'd say that as long as I'm putting up the money,
I'd put you anywhere I goddamned please.
fortunately, I'm not here to pony up.
in fact, I'm here to take back what I previously ponied.
you can't seriously expect me to give you that money back.
well, that's exactly what I expect. And I'm very serious.
well, it's gone... spent.
Aww. On what? - Campaign expenses.
I do believe my wife dipped into it a little bit.
Mr. Napier, I am not an unreasonable man.
I don't expect the actual bills that I gave you.
just give me bills of equivalent worth, and we'll call it even.
I don't have it. Not even close.
that is disappointing.
I don't know how in the hell you expect me to get that money.
as I was saying, I am a reasonable man, and I'm happy to help you find a way to square up.
I don't know suppose you'd already happen to have something in mind, would you?
for starters, an address of some local miscreant known to have large amounts of cash lying around, known further to have secrets that would discourage him from calling the police if someone were to relieve him of it.
you want me to find you a drug dealer to rob?
you know, I couldn't have said it better myself.
and if said miscreant in question happens to pay Boyd Crowder for protection...
so much the better. - Sure you want to poke that bear?
that bear poked me.
Mr. Quarles, you already managed to lose me the sheriff's office.
now you want to involve me in an armed-robbery conspiracy?
actually, I'm gonna need you to find me a buyer for the shit that I take off of this guy.
so technically, that makes it a drug conspiracy, as well.
and what if I say no? - Oh, you don't want to say no.
Oh! What... Excuse me.
Rodney. Hey, boy.
what's up with the hot-rod entourage here, Rod?
last time we saw each other, I had a gun pointed at my face. - Yes, you did.
you and me both had ourselves held up, man?
and then the next time I come down here, some squirrelly little shit from Crowder's crew tried to muscle me.
you got to be kidding me. - I ain't kidding.
you can believe it.
sometimes I'm glad your daddy didn't live to see what's happening to the drug business.
thank you.
but you didn't ask me down here to pay my respects.
that is the truth, and we should get down to business.
if you wouldn't mind, please, first, call off your dogs a bit here.
my friend.
all right, now, as I started to say, at the time she passed, my mama...
she had a little over $3 million.
do you know where to find it? - Well, I know who's got it, okay?
and he has been doing everything he can think of to try to get me to believe that there's only $46, 000.
he's been sticking it in this little cooler, trying to get me to take it.
here, take it. "I've been saying... - Get to the "who"!
the suspense is killing me.
so, what's the plan? We gonna shoot our way into Nobles holler?
Yeah, at some point, we are gonna have to shoot our way in there and grab the money and get back across the bridge before they knew what hit them.
that's not exactly my usual line.
although $3 million... might justify a man stepping outside himself. - It just might.
Yeah, I am aware that, uh, we need to find out exactly where my money is before we do anything.
and that is exactly why I asked you down here.
not how it works, Dickie. - It's...
I'm willing to make some calls for you, but you're gonna have to do the heavy lifting.
I don't think you understand, man.
I can't just be strolling around out in the open, asking people, - "hey, do you happen to know where my money is that Limehouse is hiding?" - ???
at sundown, we're headed back to Memphis. You best get to moving.
okay, so, that would be the end of the discussion right there.
I say we pop him and be done with it. - Before he leads us to the money?
just so long as it's not before he suffers some.
how do you suggest we do that, Arlo? With the feds watching him?
we need to stop wasting our time on Dickie Bennett.
we should be out there showing the flag.
maybe if you spent less time questioning your orders and more time following them, our protection money wouldn't be dropping off.
our protection money is dropping off because since.
Delroy disappeared and we inherited all of his whores, there are people out there paying money... they don't know what they're paying for.
all right, that's enough. I'm gonna kill Dickie Bennett.
and when I do, I'm gonna take my time.
but not before he leads us to the promised land.
Johnny, go back out there and see what else you can find.
when I was posted in Manhattan, a chief deputy there, this big guy named Langston, he used to spend one day a week in the field.
said it was the only way he could "feel the pulse.
the pulse? - The pulse.
of the street? - Yeah, man.
new York in the '80s.
so, that's why you come along? "Feel the pulse.
Nah, some asshole threatened to kill one of my deputies.
I'm the only one that gets to do that.
I'm touched. - You know what?
I ought to just go by myself. - Because...?
because when he sees you, he's liable to start shooting.
all right, just admit it... you're worried about me, worried I'm gonna get shot.
I'm worried I'm gonna get shot.
who's your new friend? He's down from Lexington.
guess if the D. E. A was gonna send an undercover in here, hard to imagine they'd choose him.
thank you.
Wow. Quite a place.
uh... I-I-I thought you said I d- d-didn't look like a cop.
that don't mean I think you look right.
is it true they test a samurai sword by cutting through paper?
this is a katana.
my granddad pulled this off a dead jap officer at.
Shuri castle... Okinawa.
the greatest generation at work. - He was a lying old sack of shit.
probably just bought it.
what you looking for, brother? - What you got?
I got a fresh batch of crystal, coke, pills, little bit of smack.
got guns, too, if you're willing to take a drive.
also, if you're looking for company, I got this little 16-year-old honey just up the hill... 50 bucks.
uh, no, I, uh, I-I-I'll just look at the, you know, the crystal, you know?
sure thing.
you just be real careful how you move around in here, pop.
don't touch shit till you pay.
Whoa! Holy shit. - You see how clear that is, brother?
hold it up to the sun, you can burn ants.
Oh, that's just... just beautiful.
I mean, don't you guys worry about leaving all this stuff out in the open?
cops come in here, they're coming in to search.
they'll find it even if it's hidden inside the wall.
that's a good point, but, you know, not just about the cops.
I mean, where I'm from, the dealers rip each other off all the time.
yet you have your trunk unlocked.
people don't steal from us. - Is that so?
your questions are starting to get on my nerves, brother.
I think it's time you did your business and went on your way. - Sure thing. Sure thing.
but I-I-I-I-I-I do have one little question, though.
how do you get that rust spot off of your sword?
what a dick!
I was starting to think the only flavor they served around here was vanilla.
I'm a deputy United States marshal.
Oh, how nice for you. - I need to talk to your boss.
whoa. Easy, now, sister.
unless you have a warrant, there just ain't no way.
I don't need a warrant to talk. Get out of my way.
you touched me.
would you like me to do it again?
something we can help you with?
you can start by telling your boys to put their guns on the floor and then back away from them.
or, I guess, maybe you can have one of them shoot me.
but is Dickie Bennett really worth dying in a federal gas chamber?
and those are the only two options you see for us, huh?
there's a third. You could die right here.
okay. Okay.
Dickie. Jesus.
you know Boyd Crowder runs this place now? - "Dickie, Jesus"? Ho!
is that any way to greet a dear friend?
Dickie... no, no, no. You can't stay here. No. - ??
Dickie, please. If Boyd finds us here, he'll kill us.
Yeah, okay. Listen, listen to me.
I need your help. Okay? And if you can't help, I really.
no, I can't think of a better place to meet the reaper than right here.
what do you mean, you need my help?
okay, here's the thing. Here's the thing.
um, you see, over the years, we've had to spend some time up in Nobles, hiding out from some man or in trouble.
these friends of yours who are doing the hiding... they...
I'm wondering if they maybe might have heard something about where Limehouse is hiding his money.
you go up to Nobles looking to rob Ellstin Limehouse, you are liable to end up fed to hogs.
to the hogs. Yeah, I know.
if I die here or on the moon, it don't really make a whole lot of difference.
Ellen May, I need your help. - Okay.
take... take your time.
Limehouse keeps his money buried under the church.
Ellen May, I am disappointed in you.
what?
every kid in Harlan grew up hearing that right there, that little fairy tale.
nobody believes that. Come on.
no, my... my friend Trixie, she saw it with her own eyes, so...
so, you need to promise me something.
okay. - I just want you to promise me that if you ever find yourself running things that you'll make me queen.
michigan plate. That'd be a hell of a coincidence.
it's not. Theo Tonin sent them.
and you know this how? - They came by my place this morning.
you don't think that's something you should have told your chief?
what are you talking about? I just told you.
you told me you were doing all right, that you were drinking too much but basically getting by.
you remember that? - What's your point?
even under ideal circumstances, Raylan, the prospect of first-time fatherhood can make a man feel unmoored.
Unmoored? - Oh, shut up.
I'm just feeling my way through this.
art, I've already got a daddy. - Yeah, I've met your daddy.
fair enough. Continue.
to be clear, I just don't need you to be any more reckless than normal.
all right? - You really are afraid of getting shot, aren't you?
whatever your failings are gonna be as a father,
I'm pretty sure that your child is gonna be better off if you manage to stay above ground long enough to make his acquaintance.
we got ourselves a problem.
what, Dickie Bennett's on his way to Hawaii with his mama's money on the seat beside him?
no. It ain't Dickie Bennett. I sent the collection boys out there to see Parker and.
Longbaugh on account of them shorting Arlo last week.
the hell, you say! Shorting on me?
Jesus. It ain't rocket science.
if anybody wants to know what happened to Delroy, you just say that he stopped paying and they best not go down the same road.
it ain't about Delroy, either. - What is it about, Johnny?
what did they do this time?
nothing. They're dead.
he wasn't there. - I never told you he'd be there.
I told you that was the last place I saw him.
but there was someone there, though.
and I told you... he went there to face off with a U. S. marshal.
Yeah, but you didn't tell us the marshal lived upstairs.
you know, if I didn't know any better, I'd think you sent us there expecting him to take care of us.
or you'd take care of him, have to go on the run... either way.
a man doesn't talk like that unless he's holding the nuts.
it's nothing personal.
I just figured the more soldiers Quarles has down here, the more tenuous my position becomes.
did you figure if you didn't put us together with him, we'd just go away?
I figured it would buy me some time to cut a deal...
help you in exchange for a guarantee that I don't get left out in the cold.
well, how about you help us in exchange.
in exchange for your lives?
that sounds a little odd coming from the guy not holding the gun.
did you help Quarles because of the guns he had or because of who was behind him?
Theo Tonin... he carries this ear around in his pocket.
I'm sorry. It sounded like you said... - Yeah, yeah. It's a human ear.
and, uh, whenever he wants to get some guy's attention, he just takes out the ear and he starts talking into it.
what does he say?
I don't think it really matters.
Jimmy, where's which neighbor lady? Collection boys are sitting on her.
you sure she didn't call this in?
well, if she had, you got to think, at the very least, we'd have a squad car out here by now... even in Harlan.
go get her.
as if our protection business wasn't already halfway down the shitter.
boy, this is not good. - Johnny, check the closets underneath the sink.
see if you can't find any household cleaners. - Why?
well, he poured bleach over everything he touched.
I'd like to know if he found that bleach here or he brought it with him.
what the hell difference does that make?
well, if he brought it with him, he is a pro... not some tweaker pulling a crime of opportunity.
go.
ma'am, I-I am so sorry.
I was hoping to spare you this sight. - Oh, glad you didn't.
at my age, I got to take my pleasures where I can find them.
Meaning? - Meaning I'm tickled to see these two sumbitches dead.
hope they suffered some first.
well, I suppose that explains why you didn't call the police.
police didn't do shit when these two killed one of my dogs last year...
togo.
used to bark at all the late-night comings and goings.
come outside one morning, found him shot dead in my yard.
that's awful to hear.
togo got 'em back, though. - Togo did?
your dead dog? - Who else we talking about?
well, how did Togo do that? How did he get 'em back?
I know it was him sent that husky-looking fella to do this here.
you saw the man who did this? - That's correct.
he was heavyset? - Wouldn't have called him skinny.
but you... you did say he was husky-looking. - He was. Looked like a husky.
you know, sled dog? It was the eyes.
even from across the street, I could see 'em... just like a husky.
but the man you saw... the husky-looking fella that Togo sent...
bluest eyes I ever saw.
we got it.
you said, "go figure it out." Did you not? And what'd I do?
I went ahead and I figured the hell out of it, man.
see, what I did is, I was like, "wait a second, now... Ellen May.
I'm thinking she's got to have. - Dickie, what'd you find?!
Limehouse hides his money beneath the floorboards buried in the dirt underneath Nobles church.
how 'bout them apples, huh?
you know, I think I'm gonna need me a bear hug.
I'm sorry, Dickie. - Bring it in.
I'm greedy. I'm not suicidal.
wait, wait, wait, wait, Rodney.
we had ourselves a deal, man. This ain't the Rodney I know.
come on.
I thought I had a brother in you, man.
you know, mama always said you had the balls of a man about half your size.
out of respect for your late mother, I'm gonna let that one go.
my advice?
call Limehouse, get your cooler full of cash, and get out of here!
let's go.
you federal storm troopers get what you needed?
Yes, Mr. Dunham, and on behalf of a grateful nation...
go to hell.
the marshals' service would like to thank you for your troubles.
Mr. Napier.
it's sheriff Napier... least until next week...
which means you two are in some seriously deep shit.
well, I'd be less concerned about the shit we're in and more concerned about what you're gonna have to do to stay - alive till your term ends. - You don't scare me.
I ain't some half-wit gun thug that you think you can just...
just so we're clear, I ain't some half-wit gun thug, neither.
what do you want?
robert Quarles just killed two men under my protection.
I didn't have nothing to do with that. - Whether he did...
whether he did it out of spite or stupidity, I'm not sure.
but what I am sure of is that you're the one who told him who to hit.
I didn't have nothing to do with that.
just like I'm sure you're gonna be the one to tell me how to find him.
you want to count it? - Uh, no.
not if it's still adding up to 46 and change or whatever.
what made you change your mind? - All right, gentlemen.
we have reason to believe this money represents ill-gotten gains and is therefore seizable by the marshals service under title 18, part 1, chapter 46 of the U. S. Legal code.
uh, that right there... that would be my money.
you want it back, all you got to do is show a court the legal means by which you obtained it.
may I go?
no, actually, I'm afraid you both are gonna have to stay with us while we wait for a warrant to go up into Nobles.
wouldn't want you to be tempted to tip your friends we were coming.
have a seat. I'll handle this.
Oh, shit. - U. S. marshals.
get your hands where I can see them. Step to the car.
you know, there was a day when I would have said nobody could stealth me.
yeah? What happened?
lose your edge or just realize you weren't that good to begin with?
maybe a little of both.
sooner or later, old age humbles us all.
look at that. Concealed weapon.
that's not good for a convicted felon.
what, did you pull my rap sheet? - Educated guess.
you want to tell us what's going on here? - Why don't you be more specific?
is Quarles in that apartment?
why don't you guys just walk away, let nature take its course?
Yeah, why don't you shut the hell up?
not like the world wouldn't be a better place. - This is not Detroit.
don't say I didn't warn you.
why would he go to Harlan?
I told you... he barely speaks to me.
now, please let me go.
come, come U. S. marshals! Put that weapon down!
hands behind your head!
put the weapon down. - I'm walking out of here.
no, that ain't gonna happen. - You want to see this kid's insides?
that ain't gonna happen, either. - Give me a chance to get to my gun.
maybe this could be our time. - Aah! My leg, God damn it!
on your bellies! Hands behind your head!
Where's Quarles? - He's not here!
move! Where is he?
Where's Quarles? - What do you mean?
I mean, where is he? - Aah! I don't know!
I thought he'd be here, damn it. - He told you he'd be here?
why would he tell us anything? - You work for the man.
do you not? - Where do you get this from?
Theo Tonin sent a couple of guys down here to take out the trash.
you don't think that's something you might have mentioned before?
you ever get the feeling God's laughing at you? - Why?
just 'cause we shot the guy that's looking to kill the guy that you're just dying to see dead?
you don't say much, do you?
Mr. Quarles.
dare I even hope that you have come to settle your tab?
actually, I'm looking for a place to lay low for a while.
lay low while you, uh, figure a way to square things with your friends in Detroit?
is that a guess? 'Cause that's a good one.
you know, I think we could see clear to extend our hospitality.
but that would, uh, put you critically in our debt.
you see that? - Of course.
you also see that, uh, it is not wise to let a man get so far into debt without insisting he first settle the debt already owed.
thank you kindly.
well, that's a good start.
when you think I'm gonna be getting the rest of it? - Bag's not empty yet.
do I look like a drug dealer to you?
that's pretty smart, holding all your meetings in a place like this.
the smell of blood in the air.
Plus, it gives you an excuse to hold a knife in your hand.
there's no knife in my hand now, Mr. Quarles.
now, you seem like a resourceful man.
I'm sure you'll find a way to turn that bag into something I'd happily take off of your hands.
and when you do, you know where to find me.
good day, Mr. Limehouse. - Mr. Quarles.
sheriff. This is Kismet. I was just about to call you.
is that a fact? How come?
well, it turns out I need a place to unload the spoils of my earlier endeavors.
why I called. - You have an idea for me?
I do. But I want to make sure after I tell you,
I don't ever hear from your sorry ass again.
sheriff, trust me... the pleasure will be all mine.
all right. There's a whorehouse, but they also deal to the Johns.
they ought to be able to take whatever you got.
it's called Audry's. - Audry's.
Bye-bye.
all right, you got 30 seconds. I'm on vacation. I'm having a sandwich.
uh, Mr. Tonin, I wanted to just make sure you, uh, were aware of the situation down here.
you mean that my guys got snatched by the marshals before they could get to Quarles?
Yeah, I'm aware of it. What's your name, again?
uh... Duffy, sir. - Duffy. Duffy, yeah.
I think I remember my son Sammy mentioning you.
Oh, uh... Oh. I'm glad to hear that.
Sammy's an impressive young man. - He's a moron. What do you want?
uh... Well, I was wondering, sir... do you intend on sending more men down here to...
to kill Bobby Quarles? Yeah, I plan on sending more.
I loved him like a son.
but he's wasted my money, he threatened my actual son.
and that other shit... Jesus. - Well, that's the thing, sir.
I don't know if your money has been wasted.
Bobby was onto something down here, and just because he's gone off track, no reason to turn your back on the whole thing.
so, when Quarles is gone, you want to step up.
is that about right?
Yes. - No.
okay. May I ask why, sir?
I don't know you.
I'll tell you what... you deliver Quarles, show me you can get things done.
price I gave those other assholes was $100, 000 dead, $200, 000 if Sammy gets a chance to, uh...
talk to him about putting a gun in his face.
you know Bobby like I do, you'll settle for the hundred.
Yes, sir. Thank you, Mr. Tonin.
I'll be in touch. - You hope.
Ohhh, honey! Think we're about to have us some fun.
don't you think he looks like that guy, from the butterfly movie?
the one about the time traveler? - No!
the one about the, like, prison island or whatever.
ladies, as much as I would love to get to the bottom of who it is that you think that I look like and all the kinds of fun that we could having together, the reason that I'm here is 'cause the mongoloid tending bar inside said this is the place where I could find the guy who runs the joint.
huh. Wait a second. No, no, no.
don't you go anywhere? Where the hell have you been?
I've spent the last two hours as a guest of the U. S. marshals service.
let me guess.
our friend deputy Givens has been tangling with a couple of Detroit's finest.
how is it you know that?
I saw him bracing one in front of my building... guy named Sarno.
it's nice to know at least that Theo cares enough to send the very best.
did you give them my address? - Didn't see as I had much choice.
I don't blame you. I know Sarno. He gets people to talk.
the only thing anyone's telling him at the moment is "you have the right to remain silent.
well.
I'll have to thank deputy Givens when I see him next.
I thought you were gonna kill him next time you see him.
what's the price they put on my head? - They didn't say.
strip him.
keep that chain long. Try to keep him from shitting the bed.
I trust when he wakes up, you ladies will find a way to keep him - from thinking about how to escape his predicament. - Yes, sir.
Hello? Anyone there? - Who is this?
my name is not your concern, Mr... Wynn Duffy.
your concern is for the fate of the man whose phone this is.
is he alive? It was hard to tell.
Oh, he's alive.
do you want him to stay that way?
you know, that's a very good question, Mr. Crowder.
well, I don't believe I told you my name.
it's not hard to put together the pieces of that particular Jigsaw puzzle.
well, I hear my guest here's worth some money.
how much? - $100, 000 dead, $200, 000 alive.
well, I suppose a clever man might under report that bounty, trying to keep a bigger share than what he gives his partner.
are we partners now? - Well, as far as this goes.
Mr. Duffy, can I trust you to find your way down to Harlan?
Yeah, you can trust me to do that, Mr. Crowder.
would you say you'd be willing just to kill him to eliminate any chance of his wriggling free?
well, as we speak, he's unconscious, being stripped naked, and chained to a bed.
I think we can handle him. - Don't say I didn't warn you.
you have to go through this every time? It's exhausting.
seems we agree on most of the particulars. - Well, good.
you might get out of here in time to go join the raid team. - Raid team?
tim and Rachel got a line on that missing Bennett money... already recovered $46, 000 of it.
they're just waiting for a warrant for the rest.
what's the warrant for?
this church down in Nobles holler.
apparently, it's, uh, under the floorboards.
I'll pass. - What do you mean, "pass"?
I need that money, Raylan.
I know, Art, but there's nothing under that church.
that's an old story. - You find it, then.
tell you what... I'm gonna go down to Harlan county and talk to the outgoing sheriff, see if he can get us any info on Quarles.
and if, along the way, I trip over $3 million, I'll bring it back to you.
thank you, your honor.
good to go.
now you can go. - Oh, no, no, no.
now you can go. We insist.
don't tell me you're fool enough to believe there's money under the church.
I... told you, man.
we got this on... it's, like, stone-cold eyewitness authority.
then your stone-cold eyewitness authority is either lying or old.
Limehouse hasn't used the church in years.
well, then what is he using now?
what makes you think I'd tell you?
I think that you would tell me because you want me to help you get yourself a real sweet...
piece of my money, man.
I don't really see any other reason for you to be standing 'round here talking to me.
man won't let us change with the times.
think you might have had experience dealing with someone like that yourself.
so... Where's my money, man?
are you really willing to go all the way on this?
have you been paying attention, man?
I would rather die trying to get it than die because I don't have it, man.
all right, then. We're gonna need a crew.
can't use anyone from the Nobles.
they'll stay with me once Limehouse is gone, but they won't go against him directly.
don't tell me you want me to call Rodney, man.
no. no. - That's the last thing I want.
no.
we're gonna need someone with particular skills.
sounds to me like... - You have someone in mind.
I do. And I guarantee you ain't gonna like it.
his initials are "Boyd Crowder.
you got a sonogram picture taped to your bathroom mirror.
I'm not married, if that's what you're wondering. - She kicked you out.
there's supposed to be $3 million in here, Limehouse.
way north of $3 million. - It's all spent, except what you see right there.
I believe the terms of the deal are I receive the money and then we are through, ain't that right?
that's right. Those are the terms.
then you take it back. - I'm gonna kill you, Raylan.
maybe not tonight, maybe not tomorrow, but some day, you'll be walking down the street, and I'm gonna put a bullet right in the back of your skull, and you're gonna drop.
why wait?
so we're clear...The other night, you throw down the gauntlet to a trigger-happy U. S. Marshal, and this morning, you remember you have pressing business out of town?
I told you... I'll be back in a couple hours.
and what if Givens comes by, wanting to finish the game?
you may tell him that he is welcome to wait.
you know, you disappoint me, Wynn.
word around the Detroit campfire is that you were a wild man.
comes to a little nut-cutting, suddenly you want to bitch out.
don't be like the rest of them.
you can't have the Duffy without the Wynn.
I'll see you in a couple of hours.
Hey. Morning.
just, uh, getting some coffee, and then I'll... - You can take a seat.
no, I don't... Want to be in your way.
you're setting up. - No, I'm not.
okay.
if I had eggs, I'd make you breakfast. - Well, thank you.
you want a shot in that?
uh, I usually like to wait till the sun's all the way up.
it's afternoon somewhere.
listen, Lindsey... - stop.
you don't even know what I'm gonna say.
I think you're gonna apologize again for not giving me a full accounting of every second of your life before you heartlessly accepted the gift of my feminine virtue.
well, when you put it that way, I guess don't owe you an apology.
first time you came in here, I knew you were going through something.
to tell you the truth, I felt a little bad taking advantage of you.
Really? - I mean, not so bad, I don't plan on doing it again.
listen, Lindsey... - you said that already.
I'm about to become a father. - I know. I saw the sonogram.
it's a good-looking kid.
it's got its daddy's eyes. An unfortunate nose, though.
that must be your ex's.
I'm gonna get some limes in the back.
I won't be a sec.
sorry, guys. We're closed.
heard you had a little mischief in here the other night.
well, I wasn't aware that made the news.
we had a friend who was here. - He tell you about the hot wings?
this friend of ours... I'm betting you wouldn't forget him.
he looks like he even shits blond.
I don't suppose you two fellas are from Detroit, are you?
that's a hell of a guess. - Where you buy your suit?
gallo's on Michigan Avenue? - I don't buy suits.
boss buy them for you? - Our boss doesn't buy us anything.
when I first saw him, he was wearing this little gray sharkskin number...
made him look like a kid playing a gangster in a school play.
we don't work for that gentleman.
you work for his daddy. So, what?
Theo Tonin decided little Sammy overstepped when he cut Quarles off, decided to send some new muscle instead?
hence, you two knuckleheads. - You don't want to take that tone.
why is that, champ?
I get the impression they only keep you around so little Sammy doesn't feel like the biggest asshole in the room.
I was just telling these guys we're closed.
and I believe they were leaving.
another time, then.
good. See?
there's gonna be another time.
I'll clean that up.
firing a shot in the air in a crowded bar.
that could be a hiccup. - Yeah. Let's see.
you knew that you had to get the patrons out of harm's way, and they'd already failed to heed your order to evacuate.
you knew that there was nothing above you but your own empty apartment, so you fired a shot in the air, even though you knew it was against marshal's policy, because you thought it was the only thing they would hear above the music.
write it like that. - Thanks, Art.
well, good news is, now we have a nice federal charge against Mr. Quarles.
we just start with the bartender, and we round up some of the other...
bartender doesn't make a good witness.
what's wrong with him? - Her.
Oh, Jesus, Raylan. - It doesn't matter, Art.
we want Quarles for more than this piddly shit.
threatening a federal officer is more than piddly shit.
we had Dickie Bennett for actually trussing up an officer, trying to brain him with a Louisville slugger.
how'd that work out? - Look, Raylan, just pick him up, alright?
we got patrons in there we can use as witnesses.
if we don't have Quarles threatening you, we just got you firing shots into the ceiling.
wait just a second. - Why?
I thought it was a top priority that I go bring in Quarles for the capital punishment of hurting my feelings.
it is, but the son of a bitch is threatening your life.
I can't let you go by yourself. - Tim and Rachel are at Tramble.
you honestly expect me to wait for them?
no.
no way. - Way.
you want I should open it up? Might not be the wisest idea given the surroundings.
well, am I gonna see a little something-something in there I haven't seen before?
maybe something that might make me the Harlan millionaire I was always meant to be.
you'll see 46 and change. Plus a couple of receipts.
is that right? Receipts, too.
I tell you what... you can just leave that shit shut, brother.
you still not gonna take it, huh?
Oh, now, I will.
I will take it... just as soon as it starts adding up to everything I'm rightfully owed.
you understand?
till then, you know, you can't really blame me for wanting a real good reason to hold my head up when I try to explain to people why it is that Ellstin Limehouse somehow sees fit to cheat me out of my family's fortune.
much as you know Mr. Limehouse, you really want it to get back to him that you're running your mouth on his reputation?
think him the type to sit still for something like that?
is that the best you got, sister?
whatever you decided with the cooler,
Mr. Limehouse said to give you the ride back home.
well, that is just... that's real considerate.
but I'll tell you what... I think I'm just gonna have these bastards call me a cab, you know?
the least they could do. You know what I'm saying?
real good to see you.
what do you think's in the cooler? - Probably not a human head.
Mm. That'd be cool.
if you're here to talk about running me in the special election, there's some things we gonna straighten out first.
such as? - Such as, this is staying my office.
no more talk about putting me in a broom closet.
I guess if I were to offer to back yet another of your campaigns,
I'd say that as long as I'm putting up the money, I'd put you anywhere I goddamned please.
fortunately, I'm not here to pony up.
in fact, I'm here to take back what I previously ponied.
you can't seriously expect me to give you that money back.
well, that's exactly what I expect. And I'm very serious.
well, it's gone... spent.
Aww. On what? - Campaign expenses.
I do believe my wife dipped into it a little bit.
Mr. Napier, I am not an unreasonable man.
I don't expect the actual bills that I gave you.
just give me bills of equivalent worth, and we'll call it even.
I don't have it. Not even close.
that is disappointing.
I don't know how in the hell you expect me to get that money.
as I was saying, I am a reasonable man, and I'm happy to help you find a way to square up.
I don't know suppose you'd already happen to have something in mind, would you?
for starters, an address of some local miscreant known to have large amounts of cash lying around, known further to have secrets that would discourage him from calling the police if someone were to relieve him of it.
you want me to find you a drug dealer to rob?
you know, I couldn't have said it better myself.
and if said miscreant in question happens to pay Boyd Crowder for protection...
so much the better. - Sure you want to poke that bear?
that bear poked me.
Mr. Quarles, you already managed to lose me the sheriff's office.
now you want to involve me in an armed-robbery conspiracy?
actually, I'm gonna need you to find me a buyer for the shit that I take off of this guy.
so technically, that makes it a drug conspiracy, as well.
and what if I say no? - Oh, you don't want to say no.
Oh! What... Excuse me.
Rodney. Hey, boy.
what's up with the hot-rod entourage here, rod?
last time we saw each other, I had a gun pointed at my face. - Yes, you did.
you and me both had ourselves held up, man?
and then the next time I come down here, some squirrelly little shit from Crowder's crew tried to muscle me.
you got to be kidding me. - I ain't kidding.
you can believe it.
sometimes I'm glad your daddy didn't live to see what's happening to the drug business.
thank you.
but you didn't ask me down here to pay my respects.
that is the truth, and we should get down to business.
if you wouldn't mind, please, first, call off your dogs a bit here.
my friend.
all right, now, as I started to say, at the time she passed, my mama...
she had a little over $3 million.
do you know where to find it? - Well, I know who's got it, okay?
and he has been doing everything he can think of to try to get me to believe that there's only $46, 000.
he's been sticking it in this little cooler, trying to get me to take it.
here, take it. "I've been saying... - Get to the "who"!
the suspense is killing me.
so, what's the plan? We gonna shoot our way into Nobles holler?
Yeah, at some point, we are gonna have to shoot our way in there and grab the money and get back across the bridge before they knew what hit them.
that's not exactly my usual line.
although $3 million... might justify a man stepping outside himself. - It just might.
Yeah, I am aware that, uh, we need to find out exactly where my money is before we do anything.
and that is exactly why I asked you down here.
not how it works, Dickie. - It's...
I'm willing to make some calls for you, but you're gonna have to do the heavy lifting.
I don't think you understand, man.
I can't just be strolling around out in the open, asking people, - "hey, do you happen to know where my money is that Limehouse is hiding?" - ???
at sundown, we're headed back to Memphis. You best get to moving.
okay, so, that would be the end of the discussion right there.
I say we pop him and be done with it. - Before he leads us to the money?
just so long as it's not before he suffers some.
how do you suggest we do that, Arlo? With the feds watching him?
we need to stop wasting our time on Dickie Bennett.
we should be out there showing the flag.
maybe if you spent less time questioning your orders and more time following them, our protection money wouldn't be dropping off.
our protection money is dropping off because since.
Delroy disappeared and we inherited all of his whores, there are people out there paying money... they don't know what they're paying for.
all right, that's enough. I'm gonna kill Dickie Bennett.
and when I do, I'm gonna take my time.
but not before he leads us to the promised land.
Johnny, go back out there and see what else you can find.
when I was posted in Manhattan, a chief deputy there, this big guy named Langston, he used to spend one day a week in the field.
said it was the only way he could "feel the pulse.
the pulse? - The pulse.
of the street? - Yeah, man.
new York in the '80s.
so, that's why you come along? "Feel the pulse.
Nah, some asshole threatened to kill one of my deputies.
I'm the only one that gets to do that.
I'm touched. - You know what?
I ought to just go by myself. - Because...?
because when he sees you, he's liable to start shooting.
all right, just admit it... you're worried about me, worried I'm gonna get shot.
I'm worried I'm gonna get shot.
who's your new friend? He's down from Lexington.
guess if the D. E. A was gonna send an undercover in here, hard to imagine they'd choose him.
thank you.
Wow. Quite a place.
uh... I-I-I thought you said I d- d-didn't look like a cop.
that don't mean I think you look right.
is it true they test a samurai sword by cutting through paper?
this is a katana.
my granddad pulled this off a dead jap officer at.
Shuri castle... Okinawa.
the greatest generation at work. - He was a lying old sack of shit.
probably just bought it.
what you looking for, brother? - What you got?
I got a fresh batch of crystal, coke, pills, little bit of smack.
got guns, too, if you're willing to take a drive.
also, if you're looking for company, I got this little 16-year-old honey just up the hill... 50 bucks.
uh, no, I, uh, I-I-I'll just look at the, you know, the crystal, you know?
sure thing.
you just be real careful how you move around in here, pop.
don't touch shit till you pay.
Whoa! Holy shit. - You see how clear that is, brother?
hold it up to the sun, you can burn ants.
Oh, that's just... just beautiful.
I mean, don't you guys worry about leaving all this stuff out in the open?
cops come in here, they're coming in to search.
they'll find it even if it's hidden inside the wall.
that's a good point, but, you know, not just about the cops.
I mean, where I'm from, the dealers rip each other off all the time.
yet you have your trunk unlocked.
people don't steal from us. - Is that so?
your questions are starting to get on my nerves, brother.
I think it's time you did your business and went on your way. - Sure thing. Sure thing.
but I-I-I-I-I-I do have one little question, though.
how do you get that rust spot off of your sword?
what a dick!
I was starting to think the only flavor they served around here was vanilla.
I'm a deputy United States marshal.
Oh, how nice for you. - I need to talk to your boss.
whoa. Easy, now, sister.
unless you have a warrant, there just ain't no way.
I don't need a warrant to talk. Get out of my way.
you touched me.
would you like me to do it again?
something we can help you with?
you can start by telling your boys to put their guns on the floor and then back away from them.
or, I guess, maybe you can have one of them shoot me.
but is Dickie Bennett really worth dying in a federal gas chamber?
and those are the only two options you see for us, huh?
there's a third. You could die right here.
okay. Okay.
Dickie. Jesus.
you know Boyd Crowder runs this place now? - "Dickie, Jesus"? Ho!
is that any way to greet a dear friend?
Dickie... no, no, no. You can't stay here. No. - ??
Dickie, please. If Boyd finds us here, he'll kill us.
Yeah, okay. Listen, listen to me.
I need your help. Okay? And if you can't help, I really.
no, I can't think of a better place to meet the reaper than right here.
what do you mean, you need my help?
okay, here's the thing. Here's the thing.
um, you see, over the years, we've had to spend some time up in Nobles, hiding out from some man or in trouble.
these friends of yours who are doing the hiding... they...
I'm wondering if they maybe might have heard something about where Limehouse is hiding his money.
you go up to Nobles looking to rob Ellstin Limehouse, you are liable to end up fed to hogs.
to the hogs. Yeah, I know.
if I die here or on the moon, it don't really make a whole lot of difference.
Ellen May, I need your help. - Okay.
take... take your time.
Limehouse keeps his money buried under the church.
Ellen May, I am disappointed in you.
what?
every kid in Harlan grew up hearing that right there, that little fairy tale.
nobody believes that. Come on.
no, my... my friend Trixie, she saw it with her own eyes, so...
so, you need to promise me something.
okay. - I just want you to promise me that if you ever find yourself running things that you'll make me queen.
michigan plate. That'd be a hell of a coincidence.
it's not. Theo Tonin sent them.
and you know this how? - They came by my place this morning.
you don't think that's something you should have told your chief?
what are you talking about? I just told you.
you told me you were doing all right, that you were drinking too much but basically getting by.
you remember that? - What's your point?
even under ideal circumstances, Raylan, the prospect of first-time fatherhood can make a man feel unmoored.
Unmoored? - Oh, shut up.
I'm just feeling my way through this.
art, I've already got a daddy. - Yeah, I've met your daddy.
fair enough. Continue.
to be clear, I just don't need you to be any more reckless than normal.
all right? - You really are afraid of getting shot, aren't you?
whatever your failings are gonna be as a father,
I'm pretty sure that your child is gonna be better off if you manage to stay above ground long enough to make his acquaintance.
we got ourselves a problem.
what, Dickie Bennett's on his way to Hawaii with his mama's money on the seat beside him?
no. It ain't Dickie Bennett. I sent the collection boys out there to see Parker and.
Longbaugh on account of them shorting Arlo last week.
the hell, you say! Shorting on me?
Jesus. It ain't rocket science.
if anybody wants to know what happened to Delroy, you just say that he stopped paying and they best not go down the same road.
it ain't about Delroy, either. - What is it about, Johnny?
what did they do this time?
nothing. They're dead.
he wasn't there. - I never told you he'd be there.
I told you that was the last place I saw him.
but there was someone there, though.
and I told you... he went there to face off with a U. S. marshal.
Yeah, but you didn't tell us the marshal lived upstairs.
you know, if I didn't know any better, I'd think you sent us there expecting him to take care of us.
or you'd take care of him, have to go on the run... either way.
a man doesn't talk like that unless he's holding the nuts.
it's nothing personal.
I just figured the more soldiers Quarles has down here, the more tenuous my position becomes.
did you figure if you didn't put us together with him, we'd just go away?
I figured it would buy me some time to cut a deal...
help you in exchange for a guarantee that I don't get left out in the cold.
well, how about you help us in exchange.
in exchange for your lives?
that sounds a little odd coming from the guy not holding the gun.
did you help Quarles because of the guns he had or because of who was behind him?
Theo Tonin... he carries this ear around in his pocket.
I'm sorry. It sounded like you said... - Yeah, yeah. It's a human ear.
and, uh, whenever he wants to get some guy's attention, he just takes out the ear and he starts talking into it.
what does he say?
I don't think it really matters.
Jimmy, where's which neighbor lady? Collection boys are sitting on her.
you sure she didn't call this in?
well, if she had, you got to think, at the very least, we'd have a squad car out here by now... even in Harlan.
go get her.
as if our protection business wasn't already halfway down the shitter.
boy, this is not good. - Johnny, check the closets underneath the sink.
see if you can't find any household cleaners. - Why?
well, he poured bleach over everything he touched.
I'd like to know if he found that bleach here or he brought it with him.
what the hell difference does that make?
well, if he brought it with him, he is a pro... not some tweaker pulling a crime of opportunity.
go.
ma'am, I-I am so sorry.
I was hoping to spare you this sight. - Oh, glad you didn't.
at my age, I got to take my pleasures where I can find them.
Meaning? - Meaning I'm tickled to see these two sumbitches dead.
hope they suffered some first.
well, I suppose that explains why you didn't call the police.
police didn't do shit when these two killed one of my dogs last year...
togo.
used to bark at all the late-night comings and goings.
come outside one morning, found him shot dead in my yard.
that's awful to hear.
togo got 'em back, though. - Togo did?
your dead dog? - Who else we talking about?
well, how did Togo do that? How did he get 'em back?
I know it was him sent that husky-looking fella to do this here.
you saw the man who did this? - That's correct.
he was heavyset? - Wouldn't have called him skinny.
but you... you did say he was husky-looking. - He was. Looked like a husky.
you know, sled dog? It was the eyes.
even from across the street, I could see 'em... just like a husky.
but the man you saw... the husky-looking fella that Togo sent...
bluest eyes I ever saw.
we got it.
you said, "go figure it out." Did you not? And what'd I do?
I went ahead and I figured the hell out of it, man.
see, what I did is, I was like, "wait a second, now... Ellen May.
I'm thinking she's got to have. - Dickie, what'd you find?!
Limehouse hides his money beneath the floorboards buried in the dirt underneath Nobles church.
how 'bout them apples, huh?
you know, I think I'm gonna need me a bear hug.
I'm sorry, Dickie. - Bring it in.
I'm greedy. I'm not suicidal.
wait, wait, wait, wait, Rodney.
we had ourselves a deal, man. This ain't the Rodney I know.
come on.
I thought I had a brother in you, man.
you know, mama always said you had the balls of a man about half your size.
out of respect for your late mother, I'm gonna let that one go.
my advice?
call Limehouse, get your cooler full of cash, and get out of here!
let's go.
you federal storm troopers get what you needed?
Yes, Mr. Dunham, and on behalf of a grateful nation...
go to hell.
the marshals' service would like to thank you for your troubles.
Mr. Napier.
it's sheriff Napier... least until next week...
which means you two are in some seriously deep shit.
well, I'd be less concerned about the shit we're in and more concerned about what you're gonna have to do to stay - alive till your term ends. - You don't scare me.
I ain't some half-wit gun thug that you think you can just...
just so we're clear, I ain't some half-wit gun thug, neither.
what do you want?
robert Quarles just killed two men under my protection.
I didn't have nothing to do with that. - Whether he did...
whether he did it out of spite or stupidity, I'm not sure.
but what I am sure of is that you're the one who told him who to hit.
I didn't have nothing to do with that.
just like I'm sure you're gonna be the one to tell me how to find him.
you want to count it? - Uh, no.
not if it's still adding up to 46 and change or whatever.
what made you change your mind? - All right, gentlemen.
we have reason to believe this money represents ill-gotten gains and is therefore seizable by the marshals service under title 18, part 1, chapter 46 of the U. S. Legal code.
uh, that right there... that would be my money.
you want it back, all you got to do is show a court the legal means by which you obtained it.
may I go?
no, actually, I'm afraid you both are gonna have to stay with us while we wait for a warrant to go up into Nobles.
wouldn't want you to be tempted to tip your friends we were coming.
have a seat. I'll handle this.
Oh, shit. - U. S. marshals.
get your hands where I can see them. Step to the car.
you know, there was a day when I would have said nobody could stealth me.
yeah? What happened?
lose your edge or just realize you weren't that good to begin with?
maybe a little of both.
sooner or later, old age humbles us all.
look at that. Concealed weapon.
that's not good for a convicted felon.
what, did you pull my rap sheet? - Educated guess.
you want to tell us what's going on here? - Why don't you be more specific?
is Quarles in that apartment?
why don't you guys just walk away, let nature take its course?
Yeah, why don't you shut the hell up?
not like the world wouldn't be a better place. - This is not Detroit.
don't say I didn't warn you.
why would he go to Harlan?
I told you... he barely speaks to me.
now, please let me go.
come, come U. S. marshals! Put that weapon down!
hands behind your head!
put the weapon down. - I'm walking out of here.
no, that ain't gonna happen. - You want to see this kid's insides?
that ain't gonna happen, either. - Give me a chance to get to my gun.
maybe this could be our time. - Aah! My leg, God damn it!
on your bellies! Hands behind your head!
Where's Quarles? - He's not here!
move! Where is he?
Where's Quarles? - What do you mean?
I mean, where is he? - Aah! I don't know!
I thought he'd be here, damn it. - He told you he'd be here?
why would he tell us anything? - You work for the man.
do you not? - Where do you get this from?
Theo Tonin sent a couple of guys down here to take out the trash.
you don't think that's something you might have mentioned before?
you ever get the feeling God's laughing at you? - Why?
just 'cause we shot the guy that's looking to kill the guy that you're just dying to see dead?
you don't say much, do you?
Mr. Quarles.
dare I even hope that you have come to settle your tab?
actually, I'm looking for a place to lay low for a while.
lay low while you, uh, figure a way to square things with your friends in Detroit?
is that a guess? 'Cause that's a good one.
you know, I think we could see clear to extend our hospitality.
but that would, uh, put you critically in our debt.
you see that? - Of course.
you also see that, uh, it is not wise to let a man get so far into debt without insisting he first settle the debt already owed.
thank you kindly.
well, that's a good start.
when you think I'm gonna be getting the rest of it? - Bag's not empty yet.
do I look like a drug dealer to you?
that's pretty smart, holding all your meetings in a place like this.
the smell of blood in the air.
Plus, it gives you an excuse to hold a knife in your hand.
there's no knife in my hand now, Mr. Quarles.
now, you seem like a resourceful man.
I'm sure you'll find a way to turn that bag into something I'd happily take off of your hands.
and when you do, you know where to find me.
good day, Mr. Limehouse. - Mr. Quarles.
sheriff. This is kismet. I was just about to call you.
is that a fact? How come?
well, it turns out I need a place to unload the spoils of my earlier endeavors.
why I called. - You have an idea for me?
I do. But I want to make sure after I tell you, I don't ever hear from your sorry ass again.
sheriff, trust me... the pleasure will be all mine.
all right. There's a whorehouse, but they also deal to the Johns.
they ought to be able to take whatever you got.
it's called Audry's. - Audry's.
Bye-bye.
all right, you got 30 seconds. I'm on vacation. I'm having a sandwich.
uh, Mr. Tonin, I wanted to just make sure you, uh, were aware of the situation down here.
you mean that my guys got snatched by the marshals before they could get to Quarles?
Yeah, I'm aware of it. What's your name, again?
uh... Duffy, sir. - Duffy. Duffy, yeah.
I think I remember my son Sammy mentioning you.
Oh, uh... Oh. I'm glad to hear that.
Sammy's an impressive young man. - He's a moron. What do you want?
uh... Well, I was wondering, sir... do you intend on sending more men down here to...
to kill Bobby Quarles? Yeah, I plan on sending more.
I loved him like a son.
but he's wasted my money, he threatened my actual son.
and that other shit... Jesus. - Well, that's the thing, sir.
I don't know if your money has been wasted.
Bobby was onto something down here, and just because he's gone off track, no reason to turn your back on the whole thing.
so, when Quarles is gone, you want to step up.
is that about right?
Yes. - No.
okay. May I ask why, sir?
I don't know you.
I'll tell you what... you deliver Quarles, show me you can get things done.
price I gave those other assholes was $100, 000 dead, $200, 000 if Sammy gets a chance to, uh...
talk to him about putting a gun in his face.
you know Bobby like I do, you'll settle for the hundred.
Yes, sir. Thank you, Mr. Tonin.
I'll be in touch. - You hope.
Ohhh, honey! Think we're about to have us some fun.
don't you think he looks like that guy, from the butterfly movie?
the one about the time traveler? - No!
the one about the, like, prison island or whatever.
ladies, as much as I would love to get to the bottom of who it is that you think that I look like and all the kinds of fun that we could having together, the reason that I'm here is 'cause the mongoloid tending bar inside said this is the place where I could find the guy who runs the joint.
huh. Wait a second. No, no, no.
don't you go anywhere? Where the hell have you been?
I've spent the last two hours as a guest of the U. S. marshals service.
let me guess.
our friend deputy Givens has been tangling with a couple of Detroit's finest.
how is it you know that?
I saw him bracing one in front of my building... guy named Sarno.
it's nice to know at least that Theo cares enough to send the very best.
did you give them my address? - Didn't see as I had much choice.
I don't blame you. I know Sarno. He gets people to talk.
the only thing anyone's telling him at the moment is "you have the right to remain silent.
well.
I'll have to thank deputy Givens when I see him next.
I thought you were gonna kill him next time you see him.
what's the price they put on my head? - They didn't say.
strip him.
keep that chain long. Try to keep him from shitting the bed.
I trust when he wakes up, you ladies will find a way to keep him - from thinking about how to escape his predicament. - Yes, sir.
Hello? Anyone there? - Who is this?
my name is not your concern, Mr... Wynn Duffy.
your concern is for the fate of the man whose phone this is.
is he alive? It was hard to tell.
Oh, he's alive.
do you want him to stay that way?
you know, that's a very good question, Mr. Crowder.
well, I don't believe I told you my name.
it's not hard to put together the pieces of that particular Jigsaw puzzle.
well, I hear my guest here's worth some money.
how much? - $100, 000 dead, $200, 000 alive.
well, I suppose a clever man might under report that bounty, trying to keep a bigger share than what he gives his partner.
are we partners now? - Well, as far as this goes.
Mr. Duffy, can I trust you to find your way down to Harlan?
Yeah, you can trust me to do that, Mr. Crowder.
would you say you'd be willing just to kill him to eliminate any chance of his wriggling free?
well, as we speak, he's unconscious, being stripped naked, and chained to a bed.
I think we can handle him. - Don't say I didn't warn you.
you have to go through this every time? It's exhausting.
seems we agree on most of the particulars. - Well, good.
you might get out of here in time to go join the raid team. - Raid team?
tim and Rachel got a line on that missing Bennett money... already recovered $46, 000 of it.
they're just waiting for a warrant for the rest.
what's the warrant for?
this church down in Nobles holler.
apparently, it's, uh, under the floorboards.
I'll pass. - What do you mean, "pass"?
I need that money, Raylan.
I know, Art, but there's nothing under that church.
that's an old story. - You find it, then.
tell you what... I'm gonna go down to Harlan county and talk to the outgoing sheriff, see if he can get us any info on Quarles.
and if, along the way, I trip over $3 million, I'll bring it back to you.
thank you, your honor.
good to go.
now you can go. - Oh, no, no, no.
now you can go. We insist.
don't tell me you're fool enough to believe there's money under the church.
I... Told you, man.
we got this on... it's, like, stone-cold eyewitness authority.
then your stone-cold eyewitness authority is either lying or old.
Limehouse hasn't used the church in years.
well, then what is he using now?
what makes you think I'd tell you?
I think that you would tell me because you want me to help you get yourself a real sweet...
piece of my money, man.
I don't really see any other reason for you to be standing 'round here talking to me.
man won't let us change with the times.
think you might have had experience dealing with someone like that yourself.
so... Where's my money, man?
are you really willing to go all the way on this?
have you been paying attention, man?
I would rather die trying to get it than die because I don't have it, man.
all right, then. We're gonna need a crew.
can't use anyone from the Nobles.
they'll stay with me once Limehouse is gone, but they won't go against him directly.
don't tell me you want me to call Rodney, man.
no. no. - That's the last thing I want.
no.
we're gonna need someone with particular skills.
sounds to me like... - You have someone in mind.
I do. And I guarantee you ain't gonna like it.
his initials are "Boyd Crowder.
devil, whatever led you to believe that you could pull this off?
wait! Wait!
don't know why we're out here instead of tossing this traitor in a slurry pond.
devil was a friend before he became a traitor.
Arlo! Did you take your meds today?
what I'd like to do is create a diversion... say, blow up a car.
what if when that car blows up, there's a man inside?
and say that man had brilliant blue eyes? And a big, stupid baby head?
now, right out there in that truck, I got a box full of emulex with a cellphone detonator.
I believe I know how to blow up a car.
you tell me you got Boyd and Quarles all wrapped up in a pretty little bow.
fantastic.
in the meantime, not day passes federal boots aren't on the ground in nobles holler until I get what I want.
what in the hell you doing here?
coming out slowly. Now.
drop your weapon, or I will shoot.
Tom. Quarles did it.
Quarles shot him.
I've had troopers canvassing the whole town.
and so far, no reports of the suspect.
I've got our best trackers coming in... police dog and air support.
daylight comes, we'll find Robert Quarles.
how is he? He didn't make it.
Jesus, God.
I'm sorry, captain.
chief deputy art mullen. He coded.
they kept working his heart.
took him directly into surgery, but...
he conscious on the drive over?
they didn't confirm it was Quarles who shot him, if that's what you're thinking.
I'm guessing this Quarles hasn't been found, or I would have heard it on the radio.
our fugitive task force is on its way over here.
Crowder's awake.
then what happened?
well, I don't know, because I was unconscious at the time.
I already told you. It was Quarles that shot the trooper.
shut up, Johnny. He ain't talking to you.
look, Raylan.
you want to talk to me, now, you gonna have to stand in line.
it seems like I'm the most popular man in this room tonight.
if it's all the same to all concerned, I thought I might just jump to the front of the line.
I'm pretty much done.
Raylan, I hope you have enough respect for my capabilities to know that I would not blow up a car that I'm standing next to.
who, then? Wynn Duffy.
does that name mean anything to you? Put a bolo out.
large RV. registered to Wynn Duffy security. I'm looking for Boyd and Johnny.
you let me in.
Hey, Givens. It's all right.
let him in.
what the hell you doing here?
I heard that a cop in a hat got shot.
guess it wasn't you. No. I'm fine.
I can see that. Uh, am I done here?
I got a family member that's concerned about me.
we're done.
I want to talk to you.
wondered what the hell happened to you.
yeah? That's funny.
I wanted to ask you the same question.
you pulled a gun on Ava. You stick her in the cellar.
what the hell were you thinking? Wasn't my idea.
I had to do it to shut her up.
to shut who up? Ava?
no, no. Not Ava.
I just... s- something had to be done, and I did it.
you haven't been taking your medication, have you?
I've been trying, Sit down.
she hides them where I can't find them. Who? Helen?
that's right.
thinks it's funny, watching an old man chase around his pills.
I took care of business. That's all you need to know.
I want you to take one of these pills... In front of me.
go on.
what are they doing? You want to un-cuff them?
I just need five minutes alone with Duffy.
let's go.
why don't we just start with you telling me what you know.
was it Quarles? Where is he?
you blew up the car. You must have been close.
did you see who killed the trooper?
you don't want to tell me, I'll just assume it was you.
what do you know?
what do I... What I know is I... we were on our way...
Mike and I were on our way to midnight mass, and apparently, we were exceeding the speed limit, because these gentlemen pulled us over.
Yeah, and they pulled this off of you.
I have a permit for that in my other pants.
you remember the pawn-shop owner you sent after me... Glen Fogle?
God rest his soul.
had a little game he liked to play with his flunkies.
are you familiar?
uh... remind me.
I ask you a question.
you answer truthfully, or I pull the trigger.
you understand? It seems simple enough.
you have any questions? What are you doing?
is that your question?
you think you can make me talk? That's your choice.
or you're gonna shoot me?
there's a five out of six chance I won't. Bullshit.
Where's Quarles? Kiss my ass.
Jesus! Christ! There are cops outside!
that's right. They're outsiders You're a cop!
deputy U. S. marshal.
Raylan, you just can't come in here and shoot me because you... you. You feel like it! Why not?
isn't that the way you guys do it?
isn't that why tom bergen's dead while his wife and children are grieving?
so, you know what? Now we're gonna play by your rules.
Raylan... - Where's Quarles?
I don't know! Jesus! Stop it!
what is wrong with you? !
you want me to stop, tell me the truth.
how can I tell you what I don't know?
start with telling me what you do know.
okay. Just give me a minute.
no.
okay! What do I know? ! what do I know? !
I know that, uh...
I know that Limehouse set this all up!
I know that Quarles likes young boys.
who do you think called in the Brady Hughes" tip?
me!
I know that he wants you dead, and he probably wants me dead, too.
and, yes, I tried to blow him in his car!
and then I drove away! That's what I know!
that's it? That is all I know!
you don't know where he is? I don't know where he is!
okay.
I believe you.
Jesus Christ!
well, you invited me here.
should I be expecting an apology?
I got an idea you were not entirely happy with my services.
I am returning your deposit.
duly witnessed.
there's even a little interest in there.
you really think this concludes our business? I do.
now, we can both walk away with what we got, or we can have it out right now.
although you are traveling a little light.
I don't see Devil back there, gun pointed at me, finger on the trigger.
well, I guess we best both sleep with one eye open.
I always do.
want me to make that call?
not yet.
you screwed up. In what manner of speaking?
in a very serious manner.
I'm just trying to catch up here, marshal.
you, uh, trying to say that your big bust didn't work out?
a horsefly sneezes in these hills, he knows about it beforehand, but I'm to believe the car bomb and the dead trooper down the road comes as news.
well, now that you say it, I think I did hear something about something like that.
like we're talking about the weather.
what is tomorrow's weather forecast? I reckon it's gonna be a beautiful day.
you are gonna spend it indoors.
charged with accessory to murder. Oh, now, hold on just a minute.
you promised me Boyd.
you promised me Quarles, and what I got was a dead cop.
I don't recall promising you donkey squat.
I just pointed out an opportunity, more like. Oh, is that right?
that's right. And what I'm hearing sounded like you screwed up.
excuse me? You screwed up.
you know how I know that?
because one of yours is dead.
think twice about your next move, gentlemen.
Mr. Givens? Deputy marshal.
I ain't my father, and I don't care to be confused with him.
I don't think you seeing the big picture 'round here, marshal.
now, you boys know how to get rid of blood and bones.
he shoots, you make sure nobody finds him... none of him.
I want what you promised me.
I don't know if I can get you Quarles.
but I might could get you Boyd Crowder.
I'm listening.
clear.
that helicopter again.
Hey, I told y'all I heard something explode last night. You didn't believe me, though.
night before that, you were telling us you heard a bear.
Oh, yeah, and just how do you know it wasn't a bear, pudknocker?
I don't like that kind of talk. Gosh.
can't believe I slept through all that.
mom, you don't sleep. You hibernate.
Oh, funny.
Hey, you dropped something.
nice. I get bit by a copperhead, it's on you.
maybe I'll get eaten by that bear Mitch heard.
how would that be?
mom?
I'm guessing you got the keys, sport.
Shelby, my friend. To what do we owe the honor?
we need to talk. You and me. That sounds ominous.
you only been on the job one day. You're already calling in an official capacity?
not exactly.
you alone? Well, I can be.
what is it?
I don't know. All right, Shelby.
you got me alone. Well, it's not good.
well, let's hear it.
a warrant popped. I made a couple of calls.
best I could find out, he U. S. marshals believe you put a body in the ground some nights past.
where was I supposed to have done this?
out by black lick creek.
anything else? They're watching your house.
that's why I didn't come in person.
they didn't call in my office.
they just called the state troopers.
on account of our relationship.
well, uh, where do things stand, Shelby?
well, they're gonna pick you up if they find the body.
how much time I got?
they're still digging, last I heard.
half-hour. Less.
listen, Boyd.
you saved my life and then you pulled me off the ash heap, gave me a second chance.
now I believe we're square.
good luck.
trust... Jesus.
so... you folks on vacation?
we were at a rock festival.
christian rock. I like that.
good place to bond over.
what's your name, son?
your brother's name? He's Mitch.
you don't say much, Mitch, do you?
that's okay. I get it.
look, you boys are lucky. You get to spend time with your mom.
I didn't get to spend much time with mine.
she died when I was pretty young.
speaking of which, where's dad?
we're divorced.
ma'am, if you don't mind, I'm gonna borrow your phone. I need to make a call.
now, Pete, don't do anything stupid, 'cause remember, I have got a gun pressed to your mother's back.
put Theo on the phone.
put him on the phone!
you're shitting me.
Bobby. What a surprise.
Oh, hi, Theo. I guess it wasn't my time yet.
somebody upstairs likes me. Oh, that's a great movie.
one of Newman's finest performances.
you know, just thinking about it makes me want to watch it again.
Lanny, do me a favor.
go get my copy of "somebody up there likes me. " It should be in with the classics.
okay. I'm back.
Theo, I want to come home.
you want to come home? Yes. Name the price.
Lanny, forget about it. I- it's not here.
it's at home, in Detroit.
what? I'm sorry, Bobby.
I'm at the California house. Uh, okay.
so, here's the deal.
you owe me $250, 000.
I'm gonna need that paid back in full. Okay.
and Sammy's gonna need something for pain and suffering.
pain and suffering? !
you pointed a gun in his face, Bobby.
actions have consequences.
okay. How much? Double it.
that's $500, 000. That'll get you home.
that's a lot of money, Theo.
well, you're lucky it's not more. You know why?
no, but I'm sure you're gonna tell me why.
you disgust me, Bobby... What you've become.
I don't want you part of the outfit any more.
I'll let you get things straight with your family.
you come up with the money, you can come home.
I will come up with the money.
what was Shelby calling about?
state troopers are digging up Devil.
what? Said I was the one who put him there.
was there a... a witness?
wasn't any witness. This come from Limehouse.
well, now, how the hell would you know that?
last night on the bridge, he asked where Devil was just so I'd know.
well, he couldn't have known. He could if somebody told him.
only people know anything about that are in this room.
it wasn't me.
and I know it wasn't Ava.
you can go to hell, Boyd.
I'm the one that tipped you off to Devil in the first place.
Arlo, what about you?
you said anything to anybody about anything?
no.
nothing, Boyd.
unless what?
not sure.
might have said something to Helen.
women don't know how to keep a secret.
holy shit.
Oh, arlo... - I'm sure I didn't.
except you're not sure. What the hell we gonna do?
okay, wait. What were they looking for?
what evidence can we get rid of?
honey, there's a Kentucky state police and a U. S. marshal sitting in their car at the end of this driveway.
now, we light out of here, start trying to hide evidence, we're just as likely to lead them to it.
there's got to be something that we can do!
Johnny, you watch arlo.
Boyd, please. You can't just sit here.
you got to run. There ain't nowhere for me to go.
they would always know that I would come back to you.
it's not how it's supposed to happen, without no warning.
we need more time. I want more time.
now, we didn't invent the rules, baby.
we just got to play by them.
now...
all right, Pete. Pull up over here.
right here. That's it.
nice and easy. Good boy.
all right, mom.
what do you say we get out and stretch our legs?
I'm fine.
get out.
okay. Okay. I'm getting out. Just don't... point the gun at me, not them, okay?
okay.
go.
No! No! No! No!
Pete, I'm not gonna say it again. Go!
mom, no! Come on!
take me! No! Pete, stop the car!
that's it, Pete. Mom!
it's gonna be okay, Mitch.
stop the car, Pete! Mom!
did I tell you boys I have a son of my own?
Yeah. He's about your age.
Boyd, they're here.
Arlo, you mind letting them in?
sorry we didn't call first.
Boyd crowder, you are under arrest for the murder of one Derrick Lennox, A. K.A. Devil. You have the right to remain silent.
I'll assert that right and the one about the lawyer. Fair enough.
you mind telling me how you turned this thing federal?
state police invited us to be part of a task force, due to local law-enforcement corruption and the like.
you process me through Lexington, you show the whole world there's no way deputy Givens and I could be in cahoots.
you're not as dumb as you look.
I like the use of the word "cahoots," though.
Raylan, I want to just say I'm sorry.
sorry for what?
how I treated you when you were a boy. Okay.
not an easy thing for me to say.
no, I figured not. But she insisted.
I know she was your favorite.
gave you ale-8's and moonpies, let you watch TV till your eyes rotted out.
but you don't know how she can nag. You talking to Helen again?
she does all the talking.
Raylan, woman just flagged down a state trooper.
said that she and her two boys have been carjacked by a man that fits Quarles' description.
Thanks, arlo.
yeah? We're gonna figure this out.
who is?
we are... you and me. Okay.
first off, someone's gonna pay.
damn straight. You got any ideas?
I say we start with Ellen may.
Ellen may? Yeah.
you don't know?
Dickie Bennett... he was in there to see her just yesterday.
Dickie Bennett? That's what the girls told me.
he was in there, pressing her for information, and you know how those girls talk, Ava.
that place is turning into a sieve.
even if that's true, Ellen may don't know shit.
she knows arlo.
did he tell you who he called? No.
was he talking to a man or a woman? Man's voice.
it was kind of loud. Did they argue? No. Uh, Theo.
I think he said Theo. Theo Tonin.
he said he wanted to come home. He said he wanted to come home?
Yes. He said, "name your price," and the man said, "$500, 000" .
ms. Jenson, deputy Brooks is gonna take you to see the folks at victim services, all right?
Yes, but listen to me. Please, you have to know.
this is the only family that I have.
we are going to find your boys, Ms. Jensen. Home is Detroit, right?
Yes, it is.
and with her boy driving, he's probably blown through the roadblocks already.
boys, we need to pull up stakes here and shift everything north!
call air ops. Tell them we're widening the search.
art. What?
he said he needed money. Yeah. $500, 000.
he ain't got that kind of money.
well, maybe he's gonna rob liquor stores on his way to Michigan.
I need every file you've got on him. That means go back to the office.
Yes, it does. Art!
not now, Raylan! Just do it!
Givens. Marshal?
Yeah. Who's this? Uh, this is Mitch.
Mr. Quarles says to do exactly what I say or he'll kill me.
okay.
N- now get in your car.
put your phone on speaker... Put your phone on speaker... and set it on the seat next to you.
if you talk to anyone or do anything stupid...
if you talk to anyone or do anything stupid... I will kill you.
...he'll kill me.
go. Ahh.
Mr. Quarles.
looking a little worse for wear, there.
well, I didn't have a chance to pretty myself up for you there, Raylan.
you don't by chance have an ibuprofen on you, would you?
no? Okay.
I'll just have your gun and your phone, please.
the way this works is you give up these boys, I give you my gun.
how about you give me the gun and I don't kill the boys?
boys for my gun. That's cute.
now drop your gun and your phone and take five steps back.
now.
Attaboy.
Mitch, go pick it up.
go ahead, son.
now get in the van.
move!
just so we're clear, I'm gonna want that back. Is that so?
Oh, wait a second.
this one? That one, you can keep.
why, thank you very much.
boy, you work like you eat. Yeah, you don't leave nothing undone.
just how I do things.
and I appreciate that.
I need to have a word with errol.
how about if I take this home?
how'd that be?
you are one of the few folk 'round here that's got a thing for pig tongue.
Yes, sir.
Yeah, I dress it up in mustard seed, soak it in cider to sweeten the taste.
then I put a little vinegar just to soften the texture, and it just sits right there... just sits.
till you come 'round.
you used to send plates home to me when I was a boy. That's right.
your daddy would set it aside when we butchered together.
Yep. End of the day, "lime" !
your daddy called me "lime" .
you want to fix some of this here up so I can take it home to little errol?
I'd fix it up, too.
Yeah.
I don't know what I'm gonna do once you are gone.
I guess I'll take it off the menu.
sir?
but Boyd crowder, he's in jail, and Mr. Quarles is on the run.
every lawman in Kentucky's hunting him.
Yes, sir. My work is done.
and now we are done. You and me.
Mr. Limehouse... I want you to pack your things, and you get out of nobles holler before dark.
but wh... ah.
Yeah. What in the hell were you thinking?
you gonna have to be more specific.
I got a lot on my plate right now. Calling in about Devil.
Boyd goddamn nearly figured out where that came from.
but he didn't, did he? Because I got lucky.
I laid it off on arlo and one of Ava's girls.
well, maybe it was luck. Maybe it was Providence.
now, you been wanting Boyd crowder out the way ever since he got you gunshot.
now it's done.
Yeah, maybe.
but you and me, we are not done.
Oh, my God! That feels good, huh?
you like that.
what the hell?
I'm gonna need you to get out now! What did I do?
would you get out of here? ! I already paid her!
I got your money, okay? Ellen may.
what you doing, talking to Dickie Bennett?
what do you mean? Hey, I got you!
sweetheart. I know he was here.
now, what I want is the truth. Only for a few minutes.
what did he want? ! to talk about Limehouse.
have you seen my scar? Of course.
that man stood in my kitchen! He shot me in my chest!
I know. I told him he shouldn't be here, but he just wouldn't listen.
what did you tell him?
just to talk about Limehouse and find out where he put his money... under the church. What did you say about Devil? !
devil? I didn't... I didn't say anything about Devil.
you told Dickie something he took back to Limehouse.
No! Arlo told you something!
No! You've been working with Limehouse himself!
I don't know! No!
I've been loyal! To who?
look, if I wanted to do wrong by you, there are things I could say.
you don't threaten me.
and you don't talk to anybody about anything!
I'm sorry.
easy, easy, easy.
that's it. Stop right there.
now, take your cuffs and cuff Pete to the steering wheel. Good.
Mitch, come on. Hands up, Raylan. Let's go.
out. Come.
Mr. Limehouse!
get in there.
move.
marshal. And company.
things didn't go as planned, or at least not as discussed.
stopped by for a favor.
a favor? You done lost your damn mind.
Mr. Quarles decided he wants to go home now.
I want to go home. Well, is there something I can do to help speed you on your way?
he needs a little traveling money.
how much? Uh... About half a million.
then we'll get out of your hair.
a half million ain't getting-out-your-hair money.
that's fighting money. What kind of collateral you got?
you're looking at it. Oh, so I pay or you kill the marshal?
Yeah. Well, no. First, I'll kill the kid, and then I will kill the marshal.
you do, there'll be a dozen armed men out there before you can turn around, as the marshal can attest. I can.
Yes, but then you would be dead.
okay, then.
so, we all know where we stand, don't we?
okay. Look.
Ellstin, you been saying you just want to be left alone.
well, I figure this gets it done.
come on, ellstin. You can do it.
unh- unh- unh- unh, steady. I've got the gun.
Oh, shit, it's a piggy bank!
son, grab that bucket and fill it up.
marshal, you are one strange piece of chicken.
one day, you about to tear my whole world apart over a dead trooper.
next day, you giving all this money to the man that killed him.
wait. Wait a second.
you think that I killed the trooper?
who did?
who killed him?
your old man.
Arlo. Hey.
let's go. Hey. Wake up.
wake up.
what's the matter?
let's go. Is that you, son?
you got clothes on under there? I don't know.
come on. Get up.
let's get you dressed.
w- what's going on?
they're gonna take you in the conference room, arlo.
not like I got a choice. I'll be there momentarily.
thought you might be interested.
one of the weapons that you pulled off of Quarles turned out to be a match for the gun that killed Gary Hawkins. Hmm. That's nice.
you don't sound very surprised.
kind of had a hunch.
are you okay?
could use a little sleep. Well, we'll handle the interview.
public defender's already here. Why don't you go home?
think it's true what they say.
well, what do they say?
one bad apple spoils the barrel.
well, Raylan, even in a little town like Harlan,
I think the apple barrel is obsolete.
but the expression ain't, 'cause of the truth contained therein.
you trying to tell me we ain't talking about apples?
what's arlo doing here?
likely killed tom bergen.
who told you that? Don't matter.
he doesn't deny it.
since he's part of your crew, shouldn't be too tough to tie you into it.
add that to whatever you're gonna get for Devil, and I don't suppose I'll be seeing you again in 20 years.
that's the apple, the barrel, and the tree.
he's not my crew, Raylan. He's my family.
so long, Boyd. We're just talking.
well, we shouldn't be talking.
based on the reports, he's clearly non compos mentis. Are you saying I'm crazy?
that's not what I'm saying.
I'm not crazy. I know what I done.
what did you do? Don't answer that question, Mr. Givens.
first off, I killed that state trooper, like you said.
Tom bergen. That's right.
Mr. - Why?
I did it to protect Boyd... same reason I killed Devil.
same reason you did what? I killed Devil.
we are done here, art.
he was ready to take Boyd out, and I took him out first.
so, you killed Devil? That's right.
I can show you where they found the body.
I can even take you to the gun, if you want. Why did you do it?
I did it to protect Boyd.
first, I killed Devil. Then I killed the trooper.
I guess art thought what arlo had done upset me in some way.
could really only be expected.
Ario's a criminal. Never been anything else.
art offered me a drink.
I didn't need it, but took it anyway.
then Boyd got his release.
I asked if he was proud, letting a feeble old man take the fall for him.
didn't seem to bother him none one way or the other.
he just walked out of there, happy as a preacher on Sunday.
so, then you came here, asking for another drink you don't need.
are you sure all your sister has is water?
I offered you milk and apple juice. Not even light beer?
Raylan... Why are you here?
I told you when I came in.
just wondering how this was all gonna work out.
so, you gonna stay here with your sister until the baby's born?
is that it?
I thought I might pat the belly, see the latest sonogram.
tell me a story about a man getting his arm chopped off.
you know what they're saying at the office?
I "disarmed" him.
that's pretty good.
Yeah.
well, uh... - I should go.
it's getting late, and I should let you get back to sleep.
good night.
apologize to your sister for me. I will.
Hey, Raylan.
only thing I don't understand, why... why did art think you'd be upset?
I think it was why arlo shot bergen. Which was...?
he didn't know he was a state trooper.
just saw a man in a hat, pointing a gun at Boyd.
man in a hat?
Yeah.
devil, whatever led you to believe that you could pull this off?
wait! Wait!
don't know why we're out here instead of tossing this traitor in a slurry pond.
devil was a friend before he became a traitor.
Arlo! Did you take your meds today?
what I'd like to do is create a diversion... say, blow up a car.
what if when that car blows up, there's a man inside?
and say that man had brilliant blue eyes? And a big, stupid baby head?
now, right out there in that truck, I got a box full of emulex with a cellphone detonator.
I believe I know how to blow up a car.
you tell me you got Boyd and Quarles all wrapped up in a pretty little bow.
fantastic.
in the meantime, not day passes federal boots aren't on the ground in nobles holler until I get what I want.
what in the hell you doing here?
coming out slowly. Now.
drop your weapon, or I will shoot.
Tom. Quarles did it.
Quarles shot him.
I've had troopers canvassing the whole town.
and so far, no reports of the suspect.
I've got our best trackers coming in... police dog and air support.
daylight comes, we'll find Robert Quarles.
how is he? He didn't make it.
Jesus, God.
I'm sorry, captain.
chief deputy art mullen. He coded.
they kept working his heart.
took him directly into surgery, but...
he conscious on the drive over?
they didn't confirm it was Quarles who shot him, if that's what you're thinking.
I'm guessing this Quarles hasn't been found, or I would have heard it on the radio.
our fugitive task force is on its way over here.
Crowder's awake.
then what happened?
well, I don't know, because I was unconscious at the time.
I already told you. It was Quarles that shot the trooper.
shut up, Johnny. He ain't talking to you.
look, Raylan.
you want to talk to me, now, you gonna have to stand in line.
it seems like I'm the most popular man in this room tonight.
if it's all the same to all concerned, I thought I might just jump to the front of the line.
I'm pretty much done.
Raylan, I hope you have enough respect for my capabilities to know that I would not blow up a car that I'm standing next to.
who, then? Wynn Duffy.
does that name mean anything to you? Put a bolo out.
large RV. registered to Wynn Duffy security. I'm looking for Boyd and Johnny.
you let me in.
Hey, Givens. It's all right.
let him in.
what the hell you doing here?
I heard that a cop in a hat got shot.
guess it wasn't you. No. I'm fine.
I can see that. Uh, am I done here?
I got a family member that's concerned about me.
we're done.
I want to talk to you.
wondered what the hell happened to you.
yeah? That's funny.
I wanted to ask you the same question.
you pulled a gun on Ava. You stick her in the cellar.
what the hell were you thinking? Wasn't my idea.
I had to do it to shut her up.
to shut who up? Ava?
no, no. Not Ava.
I just... s- something had to be done, and I did it.
you haven't been taking your medication, have you?
I've been trying, Sit down.
she hides them where I can't find them. Who? Helen?
that's right.
thinks it's funny, watching an old man chase around his pills.
I took care of business. That's all you need to know.
I want you to take one of these pills... In front of me.
go on.
what are they doing? You want to un-cuff them?
I just need five minutes alone with Duffy.
let's go.
why don't we just start with you telling me what you know.
was it Quarles? Where is he?
you blew up the car. You must have been close.
did you see who killed the trooper?
you don't want to tell me, I'll just assume it was you.
what do you know?
what do I... What I know is I... we were on our way...
Mike and I were on our way to midnight mass, and apparently, we were exceeding the speed limit, because these gentlemen pulled us over.
Yeah, and they pulled this off of you.
I have a permit for that in my other pants.
you remember the pawn-shop owner you sent after me... Glen Fogle?
God rest his soul.
had a little game he liked to play with his flunkies.
are you familiar?
uh... remind me.
I ask you a question.
you answer truthfully, or I pull the trigger.
you understand? It seems simple enough.
you have any questions? What are you doing?
is that your question?
you think you can make me talk? That's your choice.
or you're gonna shoot me?
there's a five out of six chance I won't. Bullshit.
Where's Quarles? Kiss my ass.
Jesus! Christ! There are cops outside!
that's right. They're outsiders You're a cop!
deputy U. S. marshal.
Raylan, you just can't come in here and shoot me because you... you. You feel like it! Why not?
isn't that the way you guys do it?
isn't that why tom bergen's dead while his wife and children are grieving?
so, you know what? Now we're gonna play by your rules.
Raylan... - Where's Quarles?
I don't know! Jesus! Stop it!
what is wrong with you? !
you want me to stop, tell me the truth.
how can I tell you what I don't know?
start with telling me what you do know.
okay. Just give me a minute.
no.
okay! What do I know? ! what do I know? !
I know that, uh...
I know that Limehouse set this all up!
I know that Quarles likes young boys.
who do you think called in the Brady Hughes" tip?
me!
I know that he wants you dead, and he probably wants me dead, too.
and, yes, I tried to blow him in his car!
and then I drove away! That's what I know!
that's it? That is all I know!
you don't know where he is? I don't know where he is!
okay.
I believe you.
Jesus Christ!
well, you invited me here.
should I be expecting an apology?
I got an idea you were not entirely happy with my services.
I am returning your deposit.
duly witnessed.
there's even a little interest in there.
you really think this concludes our business? I do.
now, we can both walk away with what we got, or we can have it out right now.
although you are traveling a little light.
I don't see Devil back there, gun pointed at me, finger on the trigger.
well, I guess we best both sleep with one eye open.
I always do.
want me to make that call?
not yet.
you screwed up. In what manner of speaking?
in a very serious manner.
I'm just trying to catch up here, marshal.
you, uh, trying to say that your big bust didn't work out?
a horsefly sneezes in these hills, he knows about it beforehand, but I'm to believe the car bomb and the dead trooper down the road comes as news.
well, now that you say it, I think I did hear something about something like that.
like we're talking about the weather.
what is tomorrow's weather forecast? I reckon it's gonna be a beautiful day.
you are gonna spend it indoors.
charged with accessory to murder. Oh, now, hold on just a minute.
you promised me Boyd.
you promised me Quarles, and what I got was a dead cop.
I don't recall promising you donkey squat.
I just pointed out an opportunity, more like. Oh, is that right?
that's right. And what I'm hearing sounded like you screwed up.
excuse me? You screwed up.
you know how I know that?
because one of yours is dead.
think twice about your next move, gentlemen.
Mr. Givens? Deputy marshal.
I ain't my father, and I don't care to be confused with him.
I don't think you seeing the big picture 'round here, marshal.
now, you boys know how to get rid of blood and bones.
he shoots, you make sure nobody finds him... none of him.
I want what you promised me.
I don't know if I can get you Quarles.
but I might could get you Boyd Crowder.
I'm listening.
clear.
that helicopter again.
Hey, I told y'all I heard something explode last night. You didn't believe me, though.
night before that, you were telling us you heard a bear.
Oh, yeah, and just how do you know it wasn't a bear, pudknocker?
I don't like that kind of talk. Gosh.
can't believe I slept through all that.
mom, you don't sleep. You hibernate.
Oh, funny.
Hey, you dropped something.
nice. I get bit by a copperhead, it's on you.
maybe I'll get eaten by that bear Mitch heard.
how would that be?
mom?
I'm guessing you got the keys, sport.
Shelby, my friend. To what do we owe the honor?
we need to talk. You and me. That sounds ominous.
you only been on the job one day. You're already calling in an official capacity?
not exactly.
you alone? Well, I can be.
what is it?
I don't know. All right, Shelby.
you got me alone. Well, it's not good.
well, let's hear it.
a warrant popped. I made a couple of calls.
best I could find out, he U. S. marshals believe you put a body in the ground some nights past.
where was I supposed to have done this?
out by black lick creek.
anything else? They're watching your house.
that's why I didn't come in person.
they didn't call in my office.
they just called the state troopers.
on account of our relationship.
well, uh, where do things stand, Shelby?
well, they're gonna pick you up if they find the body.
how much time I got?
they're still digging, last I heard.
half-hour. Less.
listen, Boyd.
you saved my life and then you pulled me off the ash heap, gave me a second chance.
now I believe we're square.
good luck.
trust... Jesus.
so... you folks on vacation?
we were at a rock festival.
christian rock. I like that.
good place to bond over.
what's your name, son?
your brother's name? He's Mitch.
you don't say much, Mitch, do you?
that's okay. I get it.
look, you boys are lucky. You get to spend time with your mom.
I didn't get to spend much time with mine.
she died when I was pretty young.
speaking of which, where's dad?
we're divorced.
ma'am, if you don't mind, I'm gonna borrow your phone. I need to make a call.
now, Pete, don't do anything stupid, 'cause remember, I have got a gun pressed to your mother's back.
put Theo on the phone.
put him on the phone!
you're shitting me.
Bobby. What a surprise.
Oh, hi, Theo. I guess it wasn't my time yet.
somebody upstairs likes me. Oh, that's a great movie.
one of Newman's finest performances.
you know, just thinking about it makes me want to watch it again.
Lanny, do me a favor.
go get my copy of "somebody up there likes me. " It should be in with the classics.
okay. I'm back.
Theo, I want to come home.
you want to come home? Yes. Name the price.
Lanny, forget about it. I- it's not here.
it's at home, in Detroit.
what? I'm sorry, Bobby.
I'm at the California house. Uh, okay.
so, here's the deal.
you owe me $250, 000.
I'm gonna need that paid back in full. Okay.
and Sammy's gonna need something for pain and suffering.
pain and suffering? !
you pointed a gun in his face, Bobby.
actions have consequences.
okay. How much? Double it.
that's $500, 000. That'll get you home.
that's a lot of money, Theo.
well, you're lucky it's not more. You know why?
no, but I'm sure you're gonna tell me why.
you disgust me, Bobby... What you've become.
I don't want you part of the outfit any more.
I'll let you get things straight with your family.
you come up with the money, you can come home.
I will come up with the money.
what was Shelby calling about?
state troopers are digging up Devil.
what? Said I was the one who put him there.
was there a... a witness?
wasn't any witness. This come from Limehouse.
well, now, how the hell would you know that?
last night on the bridge, he asked where Devil was just so I'd know.
well, he couldn't have known. He could if somebody told him.
only people know anything about that are in this room.
it wasn't me.
and I know it wasn't Ava.
you can go to hell, Boyd.
I'm the one that tipped you off to Devil in the first place.
Arlo, what about you?
you said anything to anybody about anything?
no.
nothing, Boyd.
unless what?
not sure.
might have said something to Helen.
women don't know how to keep a secret.
holy shit.
Oh, arlo... - I'm sure I didn't.
except you're not sure. What the hell we gonna do?
okay, wait. What were they looking for?
what evidence can we get rid of?
honey, there's a Kentucky state police and a U. S. marshal sitting in their car at the end of this driveway.
now, we light out of here, start trying to hide evidence, we're just as likely to lead them to it.
there's got to be something that we can do!
Johnny, you watch arlo.
Boyd, please. You can't just sit here.
you got to run. There ain't nowhere for me to go.
they would always know that I would come back to you.
it's not how it's supposed to happen, without no warning.
we need more time. I want more time.
now, we didn't invent the rules, baby.
we just got to play by them.
now...
all right, Pete. Pull up over here.
right here. That's it.
nice and easy. Good boy.
all right, mom.
what do you say we get out and stretch our legs?
I'm fine.
get out.
okay. Okay. I'm getting out. Just don't... point the gun at me, not them, okay?
okay.
go.
No! No! No! No!
Pete, I'm not gonna say it again. Go!
mom, no! Come on!
take me! No! Pete, stop the car!
that's it, Pete. Mom!
it's gonna be okay, Mitch.
stop the car, Pete! Mom!
did I tell you boys I have a son of my own?
Yeah. He's about your age.
Boyd, they're here.
Arlo, you mind letting them in?
sorry we didn't call first.
Boyd crowder, you are under arrest for the murder of one Derrick Lennox, A. K.A. Devil. You have the right to remain silent.
I'll assert that right and the one about the lawyer. Fair enough.
you mind telling me how you turned this thing federal?
state police invited us to be part of a task force, due to local law-enforcement corruption and the like.
you process me through Lexington, you show the whole world there's no way deputy Givens and I could be in cahoots.
you're not as dumb as you look.
I like the use of the word "cahoots," though.
Raylan, I want to just say I'm sorry.
sorry for what?
how I treated you when you were a boy. Okay.
not an easy thing for me to say.
no, I figured not. But she insisted.
I know she was your favorite.
gave you ale-8's and moonpies, let you watch TV till your eyes rotted out.
but you don't know how she can nag. You talking to Helen again?
she does all the talking.
Raylan, woman just flagged down a state trooper.
said that she and her two boys have been carjacked by a man that fits Quarles' description.
Thanks, arlo.
yeah? We're gonna figure this out.
who is?
we are... you and me. Okay.
first off, someone's gonna pay.
damn straight. You got any ideas?
I say we start with Ellen may.
Ellen may? Yeah.
you don't know?
Dickie Bennett... he was in there to see her just yesterday.
Dickie Bennett? That's what the girls told me.
he was in there, pressing her for information, and you know how those girls talk, Ava.
that place is turning into a sieve.
even if that's true, Ellen may don't know shit.
she knows arlo.
did he tell you who he called? No.
was he talking to a man or a woman? Man's voice.
it was kind of loud. Did they argue? No. Uh, Theo.
I think he said Theo. Theo Tonin.
he said he wanted to come home. He said he wanted to come home?
Yes. He said, "name your price," and the man said, "$500, 000" .
ms. Jenson, deputy Brooks is gonna take you to see the folks at victim services, all right?
Yes, but listen to me. Please, you have to know.
this is the only family that I have.
we are going to find your boys, Ms. Jensen. Home is Detroit, right?
Yes, it is.
and with her boy driving, he's probably blown through the roadblocks already.
boys, we need to pull up stakes here and shift everything north!
call air ops. Tell them we're widening the search.
art. What?
he said he needed money. Yeah. $500, 000.
he ain't got that kind of money.
well, maybe he's gonna rob liquor stores on his way to Michigan.
I need every file you've got on him. That means go back to the office.
Yes, it does. Art!
not now, Raylan! Just do it!
Givens. Marshal?
Yeah. Who's this? Uh, this is Mitch.
Mr. Quarles says to do exactly what I say or he'll kill me.
okay.
N- now get in your car.
put your phone on speaker... Put your phone on speaker... and set it on the seat next to you.
if you talk to anyone or do anything stupid...
if you talk to anyone or do anything stupid... I will kill you.
...he'll kill me.
go. Ahh.
Mr. Quarles.
looking a little worse for wear, there.
well, I didn't have a chance to pretty myself up for you there, Raylan.
you don't by chance have an ibuprofen on you, would you?
no? Okay.
I'll just have your gun and your phone, please.
the way this works is you give up these boys, I give you my gun.
how about you give me the gun and I don't kill the boys?
boys for my gun. That's cute.
now drop your gun and your phone and take five steps back.
now.
Attaboy.
Mitch, go pick it up.
go ahead, son.
now get in the van.
move!
just so we're clear, I'm gonna want that back. Is that so?
Oh, wait a second.
this one? That one, you can keep.
why, thank you very much.
boy, you work like you eat. Yeah, you don't leave nothing undone.
just how I do things.
and I appreciate that.
I need to have a word with errol.
how about if I take this home?
how'd that be?
you are one of the few folk 'round here that's got a thing for pig tongue.
Yes, sir.
Yeah, I dress it up in mustard seed, soak it in cider to sweeten the taste.
then I put a little vinegar just to soften the texture, and it just sits right there... just sits.
till you come 'round.
you used to send plates home to me when I was a boy. That's right.
your daddy would set it aside when we butchered together.
Yep. End of the day, "lime" !
your daddy called me "lime" .
you want to fix some of this here up so I can take it home to little errol?
I'd fix it up, too.
Yeah.
I don't know what I'm gonna do once you are gone.
I guess I'll take it off the menu.
sir?
but Boyd crowder, he's in jail, and Mr. Quarles is on the run.
every lawman in Kentucky's hunting him.
Yes, sir. My work is done.
and now we are done. You and me.
Mr. Limehouse... I want you to pack your things, and you get out of nobles holler before dark.
but wh... ah.
Yeah. What in the hell were you thinking?
you gonna have to be more specific.
I got a lot on my plate right now. Calling in about Devil.
Boyd goddamn nearly figured out where that came from.
but he didn't, did he? Because I got lucky.
I laid it off on arlo and one of Ava's girls.
well, maybe it was luck. Maybe it was Providence.
now, you been wanting Boyd crowder out the way ever since he got you gunshot.
now it's done.
Yeah, maybe.
but you and me, we are not done.
Oh, my God! That feels good, huh?
you like that.
what the hell?
I'm gonna need you to get out now! What did I do?
would you get out of here? ! I already paid her!
I got your money, okay? Ellen may.
what you doing, talking to Dickie Bennett?
what do you mean? Hey, I got you!
sweetheart. I know he was here.
now, what I want is the truth. Only for a few minutes.
what did he want? ! to talk about Limehouse.
have you seen my scar? Of course.
that man stood in my kitchen! He shot me in my chest!
I know. I told him he shouldn't be here, but he just wouldn't listen.
what did you tell him?
just to talk about Limehouse and find out where he put his money... under the church. What did you say about Devil? !
devil? I didn't... I didn't say anything about Devil.
you told Dickie something he took back to Limehouse.
No! Arlo told you something!
No! You've been working with Limehouse himself!
I don't know! No!
I've been loyal! To who?
look, if I wanted to do wrong by you, there are things I could say.
you don't threaten me.
and you don't talk to anybody about anything!
I'm sorry.
easy, easy, easy.
that's it. Stop right there.
now, take your cuffs and cuff Pete to the steering wheel. Good.
Mitch, come on. Hands up, Raylan. Let's go.
out. Come.
Mr. Limehouse!
get in there.
move.
marshal. And company.
things didn't go as planned, or at least not as discussed.
stopped by for a favor.
a favor? You done lost your damn mind.
Mr. Quarles decided he wants to go home now.
I want to go home. Well, is there something I can do to help speed you on your way?
he needs a little traveling money.
how much? Uh... About half a million.
then we'll get out of your hair.
a half million ain't getting-out-your-hair money.
that's fighting money. What kind of collateral you got?
you're looking at it. Oh, so I pay or you kill the marshal?
Yeah. Well, no. First, I'll kill the kid, and then I will kill the marshal.
you do, there'll be a dozen armed men out there before you can turn around, as the marshal can attest. I can.
Yes, but then you would be dead.
okay, then.
so, we all know where we stand, don't we?
okay. Look.
Ellstin, you been saying you just want to be left alone.
well, I figure this gets it done.
come on, ellstin. You can do it.
unh- unh- unh- unh, steady. I've got the gun.
Oh, shit, it's a piggy bank!
son, grab that bucket and fill it up.
marshal, you are one strange piece of chicken.
one day, you about to tear my whole world apart over a dead trooper.
next day, you giving all this money to the man that killed him.
wait. Wait a second.
you think that I killed the trooper?
who did?
who killed him?
your old man.
Arlo. Hey.
let's go. Hey. Wake up.
wake up.
what's the matter?
let's go. Is that you, son?
you got clothes on under there? I don't know.
come on. Get up.
let's get you dressed.
w- what's going on?
they're gonna take you in the conference room, arlo.
not like I got a choice. I'll be there momentarily.
thought you might be interested.
one of the weapons that you pulled off of Quarles turned out to be a match for the gun that killed Gary Hawkins. Hmm. That's nice.
you don't sound very surprised.
kind of had a hunch.
are you okay?
could use a little sleep. Well, we'll handle the interview.
public defender's already here. Why don't you go home?
think it's true what they say.
well, what do they say?
one bad apple spoils the barrel.
well, Raylan, even in a little town like Harlan,
I think the apple barrel is obsolete.
but the expression ain't, 'cause of the truth contained therein.
you trying to tell me we ain't talking about apples?
what's arlo doing here?
likely killed tom bergen.
who told you that? Don't matter.
he doesn't deny it.
since he's part of your crew, shouldn't be too tough to tie you into it.
add that to whatever you're gonna get for Devil, and I don't suppose I'll be seeing you again in 20 years.
that's the apple, the barrel, and the tree.
he's not my crew, Raylan. He's my family.
so long, Boyd. We're just talking.
well, we shouldn't be talking.
based on the reports, he's clearly non compos mentis. Are you saying I'm crazy?
that's not what I'm saying.
I'm not crazy. I know what I done.
what did you do? Don't answer that question, Mr. Givens.
first off, I killed that state trooper, like you said.
Tom bergen. That's right.
Mr. - Why?
I did it to protect Boyd... same reason I killed Devil.
same reason you did what? I killed Devil.
we are done here, art.
he was ready to take Boyd out, and I took him out first.
so, you killed Devil? That's right.
I can show you where they found the body.
I can even take you to the gun, if you want. Why did you do it?
I did it to protect Boyd.
first, I killed Devil. Then I killed the trooper.
I guess art thought what arlo had done upset me in some way.
could really only be expected.
Ario's a criminal. Never been anything else.
art offered me a drink.
I didn't need it, but took it anyway.
then Boyd got his release.
I asked if he was proud, letting a feeble old man take the fall for him.
didn't seem to bother him none one way or the other.
he just walked out of there, happy as a preacher on Sunday.
so, then you came here, asking for another drink you don't need.
are you sure all your sister has is water?
I offered you milk and apple juice. Not even light beer?
Raylan... Why are you here?
I told you when I came in.
just wondering how this was all gonna work out.
so, you gonna stay here with your sister until the baby's born?
is that it?
I thought I might pat the belly, see the latest sonogram.
tell me a story about a man getting his arm chopped off.
you know what they're saying at the office?
I "disarmed" him.
that's pretty good.
Yeah.
well, uh... - I should go.
it's getting late, and I should let you get back to sleep.
good night.
apologize to your sister for me. I will.
Hey, Raylan.
only thing I don't understand, why... why did art think you'd be upset?
I think it was why arlo shot bergen. Which was...?
he didn't know he was a state trooper.
just saw a man in a hat, pointing a gun at Boyd.
man in a hat?
Yeah.
stop, man. You're driving me nuts.
Yeah, and I like hearing you do your ten thousandth sit-up.
what if she's with somebody else, man?
you think by carving her name into the wall it's going to stop anything?
it's going to get us thrown in solitary, is what it's going to do.
what if she is, huh?
that woman's looks.
you know what she looks like?
what is it-- her hair smells like apples, and her laugh is like a wind chime.
no, you never told me, man.
brother, you're getting out in four months, right?
check on her, all right?
make sure she's doing okay?
you would do that for me, wouldn't you, Trevor?
of course, Sonny.
I'll kick their asses, man.
yes?
Trevor Cobb. NOPD.
come on. I told them I get paid on Friday.
please don't take the car.
I'm not here about your car.
I have something that belonged to your husband.
come in.
that's him.
it's a nice picture of of you two.
Yeah.
so, what's in the envelope, Officer?
Trevor.
what's in the envelope, Tror?
cause if it's more of his unpaid bills, you can just forget it, okay?
no, no, no, no, no.
this has, uh...
this has got to be...
what, a mistake?
officers that booked him were sure that he stole it, but it turns out that he won it fair and square gambling the night he got collared.
and what...?
why has it taken this long?
the storm flooded the property room.
and it's just kind of taken this long to sort it all out.
you sorted it out?
why would you do something like that for me?
before I was a cop, I was a corrections officer at O.P.B. and I was friends with Sonny.
Sonny was friends with a guard?
Yeah. He used to talk about you all the time.
it's almost like I, uh...
I knew you before we even met.
he was a real good man, and I'm sorry that I couldn't save him.
were you there when the storm hit?
no.
I transferred out already.
but when I heard that they were sorting out the property room,
I want back in there, and I did all the paperwork myself.
I wanted to make sure that you got the money before the guards stole it.
are you going to be okay?
I just miss him.
Yeah.
me, too.
sorry. I got to go.
you take of yourself now.
Thanks.
Hey. This is a real breakfast treat.
she was found by the cleaning crew this morning.
Mary MacDonald, 34.
owned and ran the place.
it's a pretty hot nightspot, hmm?
who's the guy at the bar?
bartender from last night, came to pick up his paycheck, got a bit more than he bargained for.
voodoo killing, huh?
this is going to sell some newspapers.
Yeah, just what the city needs right now, freakin' zombie on the loose.
so, bartender says she was a great boss.
Activecommunity, char and not into all this crap.
you find anything else?
Yeah, there's a bloody knife, like a bar knife, over near the sink with a bottle of rum and a half-burned cigar.
Hey, I know a ritual that uses those things.
can't remember exactly.
wait a second.
you're into voodoo? - No.
Patty Sutton was back in the day.
I was trying to get into Patty.
you learned about voodoo to impress a girl?
I kept kosher once to impress a girl.
and how'd that work out for you?
great. Till she caught me cheating on her with a pulled pork po-boy.
okay, could we maybe focus here, guys?
Yeah. Yeah, look at this-- three quick jabs right there.
same sharp angle.
I don't think she struggled.
maybe he knocked her out first.
she has ligature marks right here. - Yeah.
and pinpoint hemorrhaging around the eyelids and nostrils.
I think she was strangled.
stab wounds came after.
great. So, now we're looking for a zombie voodoo strangler on the loose.
no.
no, no, no, I don't think so.
this junk makes no sense.
a chicken foot, glass eyeball.
uh, there's no message in this garbage.
this ain't about voodoo.
this crime scene's been staged.
that's right.
I mean, it's not a cult that sanctions ritual killings.
I thought they sucked people's souls out and shrunk their heads to the size of acorns.
a lot of the stuff that we found on the scene are used by priests to get mounted by a spirit named Ogoun.
priest gets mounted?
is this where Patty Sutton comes in?
okay, Ogoun possesses the priest.
that way he can ask questions for help, guidance.
whoever scattered the stuff around the body knew voodoo like a hole in the ground, because Ogoun is used to protect people, not hurt them.
so we get nothing from all this.
Oh, the killer must have got this stuff from somewhere, and maybe he left a paper trail. I'll check the shops.
what else do we know about Mary MacDonald?
she came to New Orleans five years ago, opened the club about six months later.
the financial records show she paid cash for it, for her house, too.
no mortgage? Where she get that money?
Hey. Call Henrietta, get a full history.
and then send her a pound of almond brittle. Not peanut.
almond.
you two, check out the victim's apartment.
who are these guys?
guys who deserted during the storm.
chief Lewis is giving 'em a shot at reinstatement.
paperwork's by the fridge, boys.
don't help yourself to a soda.
I heard Stone hasn't worked in two years.
Corwin's old lady got cancer week after he lost his medical.
well, they should have thought about that.
got a minute?
got out of the hospital two weeks back.
helping you make that collar cost me three broken ribs and a punctured lung.
smashing up your car's all on you, Charlie.
I didn't ask you to go all kamikaze.
I'm just saying that I'm better.
just in case you wanted to know.
now I know.
look, I'm going to have my reinstatement hearing this week.
we're allowed to bring character witnesses. I want you to be mine.
you telling me that you won't?
I'm just saying I don't know what I'd say.
not sure it would help.
look, I don't need the job, Marlin.
I'm working security at the Biltmore.
good hours, better pay.
so, Charlie, why are you here?
because I'm a cop. - That's what you were.
it's what I am.
all right.
well, you ever need to work an extra detail, I...
I can hook you up at the hotel.
you know, as many hours as you want.
if I help you with this, right?
no, man. I'm...
no. I'm saying that you could clear an extra ten grand. Maybe 15.
this is how you going to play it, Charlie?
this is how you think it needs to be done? Grease me?
whoa, Marlin, no! - And I put in a good word? Charlie, just go!
because this bribe window is closed.
three years we've been partners, Marlin.
all the good times, all the bad times-- all them go out the window, too, 'cause I screwed up one time?
you continue to stay perfect, Marlin, all right?
look, it's not whether I want to forgive him, it's whether I can.
is that what you keep telling yourself?
Hey, you never abandon your partner.
look, I wasn't a cop during the storm, Boulet, but I heard the stories about how cops took sniper fire for days.
or how their daughters were being raped.
not every guy that walked during the storm should be punished for the rest of their life.
like you said, Cobb, you weren't there.
no, I was in a prison cell killing a man.
and you forgave me.
Hmph, this place is sparse.
kind of like my place.
how you figure? They both got floors?
where you live, you got piles of stuff, right?
I got piles on my piles, so?
so you're not going anywhere.
but if you were or you thought you might, you wouldn't be settled in.
there's no books, there's no pictures, and there's no piles.
hey...
she paid cash for this place, right?
either she's rich or she didn't want a paper trail.
or both.
fugitive, maybe?
no names in the address book.
it's like she's a ghost.
or on the run.
living light.
Boulet, she was definitely looking over her shoulder at something.
maybe these will tell us what.
letters. Same handwriting.
dear Mary, God, I miss the nights we spent together.
not the awful cot, just the connection we made, Mary.
it only deepens as I accept that we can never see each other again.
yours always, N.M.H.
just initials.
no signature.
there's no postmark, return address?
just these letters.
Cobb?
you got an address?
Uh-huh, got it.
love Tap just got a hit from one of the voodoo shops.
buyer's name is Sam Winston.
guy's a DJ at Mary's club.
Mr. Winston?! NOPD!
Hey, Boulet, check this out.
the lock was busted and the door was open, right?
right.
clear! Sam Winston?
runner!
go, go, go, go, go.
I'll get the front.
get the car.
Hey, she's running one block south of Marigny.
I'm right halfway up the block.
stop!
through the alley!
Cobb, one-story, blue awning, be out front.
get on your face.
another block, I would've had her.
I'm sorry to steal your thunder.
so what hell you run Sam?
I heard about what happened.
how it happened, the voodoo stuff.
which all belonged to you, correct?
I kept it at the club, so I knew how it would look.
Yeah, how's that?
like I killed her.
the bartender we talked to said you used to DJ at the club five nights a week.
now it's just down to one or two nights.
Mary cutting back your hours could cost you some money.
I'd never hurt Mary. - Not intentionally.
but if you didn't get what you wanted...
no, that's not what happened.
you just fought, it got out of hand and...
no, you don't understand.
I loved her.
for a while, Mary and I were involved.
we hooked up a few years ago.
Mary was straight, but she was lonely and...
experimenting.
who is N.M.H?
you know who that is?
I don't know.
maybe one of Mary's lovers that you got jealous of.
hmm? That why she broke up with you?
no, I broke up with her.
Mary had a secret.
it's like she was scared of getting too close to anyone, and after a while, I couldn't take it.
she always knew I was into voodoo, but she never asked me about it, and then...
that's why I brought the stuff to the club.
to summon a spell for her protection.
you clipped this article, right, Sam?
I thought it would make her happy.
but it...
it didn't.
check out the date on this, Boulet.
it's a month ago.
right when Mary's fear kicked in.
did we say it did?
you feeling bad about something?
look, man, her story was my big break, okay?
it got me on the front page.
it got picked up by the New York Herald.
I mean, you think I want to spend the rest of my life on the obit desk?
you're going to be in the obit pages if you don't tell us how you heard about her.
after the storm, there were these rumors about a mysterious angel helping pay people's bills in Algiers.
so I checked into it, found out it was true.
so I poked around a little bit.
found out it was Mary.
I asked her for an interview, but she said she didn't want any credit.
if she didn't want the credit, then she probably wasn't smiling for the photos.
so how did you get the picture of her?
she ran a club. She's a public figure.
you're a roach, Lieb, you know that?
Hey, man... I'm sorry she's dead.
I am. I got feelings.
so let's work on this together, you know? Solve her murder.
we'll all benefit.
yeah? - Yeah.
how's it going to benefit Mary?
God, I hate this part of the job.
you take interviews in the neighborhood.
I'll do co-workers and bar patrons.
what we're looking for is not in here.
it's in her past, before she got here.
guys, I know why we had trouble with our vic's financial history.
you talked to Henrietta?
Yeah, but she couldn't tell us much because...
you gave her almond brittle, right? Not peanut, almond.
marlin, she couldn't find out anything because Mary MacDonald is dead.
of course she's dead.
no, for nearly 20 years.
I cross-checked her social and birth certificate.
Mary. P. MacDonald died fire in 1989
okay, why did our Jane Doe need a fake ID?
my first thought, witness protection.
but the Feds would've been crawling all over this place the moment that Mary went cold.
for "sincere religious" reasons.
fits with our devil worship theme.
Hey, voodoo ain't devil worship.
was no one listening to my lesson?
we're checking that angle, anyway.
what about the real Mary MacDonald?
any connection there?
I'm looking into the factory other vics, living relatives, anything we can find.
well, let's get to it.
marlin, walk with me.
Yeah.
reinstatement hearings start today.
Yeah, I saw him slink in.
I take it you're not going to speak on Charlie Pratt's behalf.
you mean tell them why he deserves his job back?
Hey, he took an oath, just like us, and left me in the water.
he left this city in that water.
Yeah, yeah, you're right.
and we're sinking, Marlin.
the department's l40 sections collapsed since the storm.
that's down 25%.
and the murder rate's up 69%.
I need boots, and these guys are trained, willing, and ready.
maybe we should recruit violent felons, huh?
there are degrees of guilt, and you know it.
Charlie didn't bolt with an armful of DVDs and never come back.
he left for four days to take care of his family.
you won't give him a second chance?
now, I'm leaning toward taking him back, but I got a squad to run, and I need to know if we're going to have a problem.
cause I'm just fine.
what's this? - That's Charlie's file.
parts of that may interest you.
sorry, I always forget to turn this thing off.
people's guns set it off.
I don't have my gun on.
Hey, Boulet. - Yeah?
I think I just figured out what we're missing.
what's that?
the link to Mary's past.
when I was in Afghanistan, I got hit with shrapnel.
the doctor said, "Just leave it in there, you're better off."
what's your point?
the metal in those bombs has its own unique signature.
Mm-hmm. If you did an autopsy on me right now, you'd know that I fought in that war.
my body... it tells my story.
ordering X rays on an obvious death by strangulation when I've already done the autopsy?
Thanks. Really, thanks a lot.
Arnie, there's a murderer on the loose.
Oh, I know, I read the papers.
there's a lot of that going on these days.
none of it's helping my backlog.
all right, let's see how you wasted my time.
and the taxpayers' money.
Oh, funny, you're a funny... What are you a comedian?
he's a funny guy.
I liked your last partner.
at least he knew how to be quiet.
Oh, no.
all right, this is Jigsaw puzzle city.
multiple fractures-- collarbone, arm, cheek.
you guys are definitely onto something with this.
so you're saying maybe she wasn't strangled?
no, uh, she was definitely strangled.
these are old wounds.
how old?
moderate calcification, healed over time.
uh... maybe five, ten years.
that means it happened before she ran to New Orleans.
what was she running from?
the son of a bitch who did this to her.
this was a battered woman.
redid her life, and then he hunted her down.
Boulet.
good...
glue Boy...
good job.
that was Glue Boy.
he checked into that fire.
of the 53 people who died, 32 of them come up as active taxpayer IDs.
let me guess.
all women. All women.
Oh, man.
there's one right here.
an underground shelter in the '80s out of Mississippi.
Mm-hmm. Look at that.
allegedly helped hundreds of battered women escape and get new identities.
the 32 abused women who got IDs out of the fire...
maybe they all knew each other.
I doubt it.
the point is to stay anonymous.
in the same town.
had some support group in common.
hold on a second.
where is it?
N-M-H. Let me see that list. Give me the list.
right here.
got it.
no, no. Nancy M. Holder.
let me see that.
God, I miss the nights we spent together.
not the awful cot, just the connection we made, Mary.
we were wrong.
they weren't girlfriends.
spending time together, on cots.
maybe there was some kind of safe house.
where they waited for their new lives to get set up.
we got to call Nancy Holder because she's our line to who Mary was.
there's no way she's gonna talk to a stranger on the phone who says he's a cop.
maybe we can talk to her ourselves?
man, there's a lot of people here.
don't worry, Cobb, we'll find her.
I think I boiled it down to a few possibilities based on body language...
or you could do that.
despite my partner's tactics, we're not here to blow your cover.
we just want to catch Mary's killer.
if you truly loved her, Ms. Holder...
now's the time to show it.
Mary and I met at the safe house.
my first night.
I'd just spent 20 hours on a bus.
my arm was broken, my nose.
we were in this abandoned bowling alley, and the damn heater never worked.
Mary, she, uh...
...she knew where they kept the extra blankets.
can you tell us anything else about her?
her husband was a drinker.
they all are.
Mary used to say she could tell it was going to be a bad night if the Reds lost.
I tried running.
I was even homeless for a little while.
he tracked me down.
he was like a ghost with a fist.
Nancy's said her ex would come after her whenever she ran.
if Mary's ex fits the part, he probably filled a missing persons' report.
she said her husband was a Reds fan.
what are the odds?
Ohio?
let's call their State Police.
see if any reports from 2002 match our girl.
she spent five years worrying that her past was gonna bite her.
that's not really escaping it, is it?
don't go all moody on me, man.
ain't nobody looking for you.
you don't play with matches, you don't get burned.
what?
Hey, Cap, what's going on here?
a woman was caught passing some marked bills.
from some bank robbery a while back.
it's probably just some innocent that got passed a fake $20, right?
that's what we thought at first.
someone's going to jail, huh?
she won't be that pretty for long.
112 missing persons' reports, man.
all filed by husbands in Ohio in the four months Mary disappeared.
ms. Gossett.
Hey. Am I disturbing you?
no, no, I just need a sec.
we need an hour, man.
we match these file photos with our Jane Doe, we're in business.
just give me a minute, all right? Just one minute.
what's going on?
ms. Gossett, I'm Officer Cobb.
officer? Understand...
what don't you understand?
that you're in a heap of trouble?
that you were caught with stolen money?
someone's about to take a very big fall.
either you, or the person you're protecting.
do you understand that?
I'm scared.
if you need anything while you're here...
if you're thirsty...
I thought she belonged to the feds?
she does.
Cobb convinced me to let him have a run at her.
here's the situation:
after you passed the bad hundred, we found $21, 000 in a shoebox beneath your bed.
and the money was stolen?
from a bank, five years ago.
the FBI is on its way down here to ask about your involvement.
but I wasn't involved.
I didn't have anything to do with it.
someone did.
and who is that, Ms. Gossett?
you want me to tell you who gave me the money?
Yes, I do.
and if you tell them who he is, he'll go to jail for a long, long time.
what's her name?
she was married to a con named Sonny who died during the storm.
what, did you know him?
no.
no, can't say that I do.
he was a corrections officer.
he said he knew my husband, Sonny.
he told me the money belonged to Sonny.
and you didn't know him?
no.
you had never met him? - That's right.
and you didn't ask his name?
you let a man into your trailer and you never asked his name?
he was very...
mysterious.
she's lying.
Yeah, I'm not so sure.
come on, that corrections officer story is thinner than my hair.
she's obviously protecting somebody, and she's gonna go to jail because of it.
what the hell you got going on here, man, hmm?
you gonna let that girl go down for you? For your royal mistake?
look, man, that's...
guys, hey.
I think I might have found our Jane Doe.
meet Allyson Beatrice.
it's a match, right? Mm-hmm.
you contact Beachwood PD?
Yeah, they've sent units to the ex-husband's home and office
I'm just waiting to hear back.
Oh, check this out.
Hey, what's your problem?
I ain't the one with the problem.
okay, I see. Lover's quarrel.
this guy's got three restraining orders?
uh, once I had her ID, I actually did a little digging.
there were five.
the ex is Phil Beatrice.
hit her with a lamp, threw her down the stairs.
this guy's a real prince.
hello.
what do you got?
Phil Beatrice is in New Orleans.
what?
that was the Beachwood PD.
they rolled up on his office, and his secretary said he's on vacation
here. Hmm?
the money yours, isn't it? Stop!
don't tell me.
just nod.
when Internal Affairs hauls in your sorry ass,
I want to be able to tell them that you told me nothing.
maybe have an outside chance at keeping my job.
I was trying to do a good thing.
a good thing? Yeah.
volunteering is a good thing.
donating food.
but getting involved with the wife of the man you killed?
cause I assume you're sleeping with her.
in no universe is that ever a good thing.
look, I screwed up, okay?
it's a messy world.
the last thing I wanted to do is hurt her.
how the hell do you think I feel?
look, man, just give me some time to work things out, okay?
and just stay the hell out of my way.
I told you before that if you were still a criminal,
I would take you down.
after this case is over, you turn yourself in.
or I'll do it for you.
hotel dick says our boy has a cabana up here.
like he's celebrating.
what number did he say?
three. There it is.
I'm going to get you. You'll never get away from me.
NOPD! Get down! Get down! - What are you doing?
are you insane? - Phil, what's going on?
ma'am, are you okay? - Of course I'm all right.
he was playing with my son. Let him up.
daddy, what's wrong?
daddy.
vacation, huh?
I hear that.
bourbon Street, fine food, late-night jazz.
murder. - What are you talking about?
Mary MacDonald. - Who's that?
you know her as Allyson.
your first wife? - What are you talking about?
Allyson was killed in a car crash five years ago.
wrong. Allyson ran away five years ago from you because she was tired of getting beaten on.
what? That's not true.
she anged her name, identity, was safe until you saw a picture of her in the paper and decided to come down and kill her.
do I look like a killer to you?
I sell eyeglass frames, for God's sakes.
what I don't get, Phil, is...
why did you bring the family along with you?
was it because you knew you'd need an alibi?
maybe it was just to rub it in Allyson's face, show off your new trophy wife.
letting her know that you don't need her anymore.
look, if it is Allyson and she was murdered, that's horrible.
we had a difficult marriage, but if you think that I wanted her dead, you're-- that-- you're crazy.
crazy is killing your ex-wife and then trying to make the murders look like black magic.
that's crazy, Phil.
I'm gonna have to agree with my partner there.
because it's sloppy, Phil.
it was something that just happened in the moment and you set that up as a smokescreen.
maybe you wanted to see that scared look in her eyes again.
just like old times, huh, Phil?
except it was a different look this time, wasn't it?
pity, maybe.
contempt.
she wasn't afraid of your sorry ass anymore and that's what set you off.
do... do you think I need a lawyer?
anything?
Yeah, he's our guy, but he's lawyering up.
Hey, Cap, is the observation room free?
observation? Yeah, why?
well, if we can't talk to the husband, maybe we can wire it so she can get him talking.
I don't know what's going on.
why is my husband sitting in there like some criminal?
were you with your husband Thursday night between the hours of 10: 00 p.m. and 4: 00 a.m.?
between... yes.
we were asleep at the hotel together.
he lost his first wife, didn't he?
she died in a car crash. Why are we talking about this?
has your husband ever beaten you?
of course not.
I mean, we have arguments like all adult couples.
sometimes it gets a little physical, but nothing...
physical like this?
here, go ahead, take it.
you recognize her, right?
that's Allyson, Phil's first wife.
he did that to her.
I don't believe you.
Any-anybody could do this.
we have Allyson's X rays.
dislocations, broken bones.
we know she filed a restraining order against your husband when they were married.
now, if we look through your medical records, will we find the same?
look, Phil has a temper.
it's no secret, even he admits it, but he...
he adored her. He was devastated when she died.
did he ever get over Allyson?
maybe not completely.
it's natural, I understand that.
this is Allyson two days ago.
down here her name was Mary MacDonald.
there was no car accident.
Phil made that story up.
no, no, no, no, Allyson lost control of her car.
she had been drinking.
your husband filed a missing persons' report.
why would he do that if she was dead?
Allyson moved here.
a new life, a new identity, but your husband found out where she was.
he saw her picture in a newspaper.
trip to New Orleans-- his idea or yours?
his.
when did he mention it to you?
first week of September.
does he read the Look at that.
look at that date.
what does that say?
september 2nd.
ms. Beatrice, the whole time that you guys had been together, he's been looking for her.
I'm only going to ask you this one last time.
was he with you every minute of Thursday night?
no.
Ellen couldn't sleep.
she came in and woke me up. I put her back to sleep.
Phil wasn't there.
what time was this?
about 1: 30.
he came back around 3: 00.
he didn't know I was awake.
shut up! Shut up...
you stupid bitch!
shut up! Shut up... or I swear to God
I will come in there and...
come in.
you got a confession from Beatrice. That was nice work.
Thanks.
cap, I got another confession for you.
it's on the Gossett case.
I thought she wasn't talking.
no, no, no, it's not her confession.
it's mine.
she was lying to protect someone.
me.
I gave her the money.
excuse me, Cap.
not now, Boulet.
I'm afraid that this can't wait.
marlin, it's too late. What the hell are you doing?
you told him?
he's lying, Cap, he's lying to protect me.
no, I'm not, what are you-- I... - Hey, Cobb.
you guys want to figure that outside?
what the hell is going on?!
you saw me react when Cobb was interrogating A. J.
Yeah. - Because I know her.
cap, listen to me.
I got this.
all right, you know her.
then tell me about the money.
I didn't know it was marked.
or from a bank robbery.
I found it clearing houses after the storm.
there was nothing but junk, and I saw a bag and...
I never saw a claim, so I kept it until I found somebody who needed it.
Cobb, give us a minute.
so you and this woman...
you're having an affair, right?
I mean, everybody needs $20, 000.
why would you give her the money unless you were having an affair?
and that's why you wanted to keep it a secret, not tell anybody so Ayana wouldn't find out?
that girl could have gone to jail if Cobb hadn't said something.
Yeah, I know.
Cobb's been on me to come clean ever since they brought her in.
the cap's kicking her.
he said he's going to tell the feds that Sonny robbed a bank and gave her the money, and she didn't know it was stolen.
he's going to lay your crime off on a dead guy.
he believed it then?
he thinks I'm nailing your girlfriend, and to protect your ass, I don't tell him any different.
now I'm the one that's living a lie.
I'm sorry.
be straight up with me, man.
who else is going to come looking for this money?
how else is this going to bite us?
I don't know.
I'm telling you, Boulet, I don't know.
why did you bail me out?
I know it's not so easy to deal with that, and like I said, you never abandon your partner.
you need to leave her alone, man.
she's not your girlfriend, and she can never be. You hear me?
Thanks, Boulet.
Yeah. Yeah.
I left during the storm 'cause I was scared for my family, but I know now that it was the wrong thing to do, and not because other people tell me so.
my shame comes from inside...
and it's so deep...
I can barely look my children in the eye, especially my oldest son.
living with my decision has been so hard on my family these past two years that sometimes, when I lie awake at night, I-I think it might have been better if...
if the storm had washed me away.
let me get a beer.
and one for my friend here, too.
next round's on me.
you break.
ain't nothing changed.
morning, Virgil.
morning, Virgil.
you know they get these flowers delivered every week?
with new crystal vase and all that.
I asked the delivery man.
I said,"what's the bill with the roses?
know what he said?
they're hydrangeas.
Yep, that's what he said.
you're 38 seconds late.
they wanna see consistent double-digit growth before they're convinced that Knapp is, in fact...
there you are.
you're smiling.
the woman from the Times is here.
the woman from the times, huh?
breakfast with the Cains.
did you tell her we don't actually eat breakfast?
I laid your clothes out on the bed.
missed a spot.
let's use the window as the backdrop for the cover photo.
good morning, Alice.
good morning, mommy.
Alice is my youngest.
What'd I tell you about making a mess in my kitchen?
that is Maria.
she's been with us since Leopold was born.
and this is Virgil.
he's my brother Leopold's-- Alice?
we don't discuss Virgil with guests-- sorry mommy Merci.
why do people need bodyguards?
sometimes the world doesn't make sense.
mom says you have to come now.
morning.
this is my husband Conrad.
Conrad, this is-- the girl from the times.
so how did you two meet?
well, a pretty girl across a crowded room.
the moment I saw her I knew what I wanted.
the rest is history.
morning, Leo.
don't call me Leo. It makes me sound like an old man.
whatcha reading?
the origin of consciousness in the breakdown of the bicameral mind.
behind all of this wet hair is our son Leopold.
five minutes.
don't talk on the cell phone in the house, it makes you look like a gangster, it's cool to look like a gangster these days, mom
ready to take a picture?
how long today?
three minutes, 12 seconds.
the world record for static apnea is eight minutes, six seconds, held by Martin Stepanek of czechoslovakia.
what's the longest you ever held your breath for, Virgil?
long as I had to.
my dad says it's stupid. That I should give it up.
what do you say?
I tell him not to hold his breath.
let's go.
it's only Alfred.
his driver broke down. We're giving him a lift.
morning.
Mr. Greene.
Mr. Schroeder.
why don't you tell me something about yourself?
what do you wanna know?
Oh, I don't know.
what do you want me to know?
I'm a pisces.
this is my natural hair color.
I prefer the country to the city.
Oh, yeah?
why is that?
why do you prefer the country to the city?
I like to go on hikes.
Oh, really?
why don't you tell me about one of your hiking experiences?
I could tell about the time I went on a hike and saw three rattlesnakes and a dead dog.
okay.
well, this one time I went on a hike and saw three rattlesnakes and a dead dog.
to brass tacks, then.
how does this work?
the way that it works, Mr. Greene, is that no one knows the way that it works.
everyone is given a task.
you do your job, you get paid a flat fee. Guaranteed.
it's an early bird snatch.
high society.
headlines.
very public.
you work in contingency.
get down, don't move
clear.
come here.
Leopold's school just called. He hasn't shown up.
well, did you try his cell phone?
I did try his cell. He's not answering.
Ellie, look, relax.
I'm sure he's okay.
what is it, Maria?
Ellie, what?
Where's Leopold?
don't call the police
Aubrey, it's dad calling again.
something has happened, and it's very important that you call me so I know that you're okay.
daddy?
Yeah, sweetie. Just keep reading.
I've called a couple of times, and you're not answering. -- Daddy?
sweetie, just keep reading, okay?
I don't like when you disappear, Aubrey
Dad!-- What?
you're using mayonnaise instead of peanut butter.
I'm sorry, sweetie.
Mr. Cain?
could you, um-- sure.
peanut butter and jelly.
I spoke to Russ Alderman over at securtrust, Virgil's employer.
he says they'll keep it quiet on their end.
all right.
Connie, is there anything I need to know that I don't know?
what the hell do you mean by that?
what are we doing, Conrad?
Roger and I were just discussing it.
we could call the police.
no, no. We're not gonna call the police.
the note said not to do that.
I would think the note always says that.
I'm calling my father. He knows what to do.
no, you're not calling your father.
he's my son.
I'll deal with it.
then deal with it...
now!
look, I know a guy.
well, I know of a guy.
he's a specialist.
pretty.
you know those things'll kill ya?
I'm here for the girl.
my parents have paid you. Why am I still here?
shut up and eat!
hard or easy?
my name is Knapp. I was hired by your father. I'm here to bring you home.
your dad told me that when you were a little girl, he called you Sammy.
but now he calls you Samson.
cause you're the strongest person he's ever known.
I could use some of that strength right now.
okay?
okay.
there's just one more thing I need you to do.
let's get you home.
let's go home.
thanks for bringing her back to us.
she gonna be okay?
someday.
thank you for coming, Mr. Knapp.
Roger, I'd like a moment alone with the Cains.
so you're Knapp's associate?
Yeah.
do you have a name?
Yeah.
the first thing I gotta tell you to do is call the FBI.
you should know that option is available to you.
the second thing I'll tell you is whatever you do, don't call the FBI.
you see, the fbi's objectives during a kidnapping investigation are to effect the safe return of the subject along with the identification, apprehension, and prosecution of the kidnappers, as well as the recovery of the ransom payments.
all I care about is retrieval.
everything else is a distraction.
my fee is non-negotiable, payable upon the safe return of the kidnapped victim, intact.
what does that mean,"intact"?
that means we don't pay him if Leopold's dead.
from nothing comes nothing.
you're not very good with people, are you, Mr. Knapp?
no, but I'm good at finding them.
Latimer King is the last of the bloodhounds, a man who follows his gut.
hell, can't even turn on a computer, can he?
this man taught me everything I know.
mistake.
come on. Let's give it up for Latimer King.
I know I'm pretty, friend, but I'm not that pretty.
you probably don't remember me.
Atkins.
I was stationed up in anchorage when you were worKing the hollister case.
that's a nice, quiet beat up there in Alaska.
why you transferring here?
I thought I could do some good.
are you the bright-eyed and bushy-tailed north American go-getter?
I was looking forward to worKing for you.
I'm retiring.
you're a good agent.
why would you retire?
you know what percentage of pattern is?
the number of pellet marks in a 30-inch circle over a 40-yard range divided by the number of pellets in a load.
that is why I'm retiring.
what's wrong?
uh, would you excuse me for a second?
sure. -- Thank you.
what?
Virgil didn't come home last night.
you call his office?
they said he was on vacation, which would've been true if we hadn't already missed the flight.
Virgil told me if anything ever happened to him that I should go to you.
he said you'd handle it.
Alice, our youngest, she has no idea what's going on.
our other daughter Aubrey is away at school brown.
we've been trying to get ahold of her for the last 12 hours.
I want you to make me a list of enemies.
enemies?
anyone you have a history with who might wanna see something bad happen to you or your family.
no, I don't-- mr. Cain.
a man in your position is bound to have a few enemies.
what are you suggesting?
I'm suggesting your husband make a list.
buddhist Epistemology
what kind of 15 year-old reads buddhist epistemology?
a lonely one.
don't tell me you've read it.
not in this translation.
you set up on the phones?
Yeah.
inbound.
get me outbound
get on the horn with jim Elwood in Rhode island.
tell him to find Aubrey Cain, brown undergrad.
bring her in.
where are you going?
gotta talk to the masters kid.
are you Alfred?
hello.
Mr. Cain, it's joe from the lobby.
can I help you?
Mr. Cain, I'm special agent Latimer King, FBI.
can I speak with you just for a few minutes?
so how can I help you, agent King?
uh, this is about, um, your son's bodyguard, Virgil Hayes.
is he in some kind of trouble?
he's missing.
so yeah, that is a possibility.
missing? -- Yeah.
please.
thank you.
that's strange.
I just saw him yesterday morning.
what time was that?
it was the same time as every day. 7 am.
you can set your watch by him.
is your son here now, mr. Cain? Could I speak with him?
no, Leopold went to visit his sister Aubrey up at college.
alone?
how do you mean?
did Virgil go with him?
uh, no.
and I was against it, but Leopold, he, uh...
well, you know, as a parent, you have to pick and choose your battles.
Oh, yes.
he get there okay?
Yes, yes. My wife spoke with him. Everything's fine.
brown, huh?
what's that?
uh, I'd hate to be getting that tuition bill in the mail.
that's right.
is there anything else?
uh, no.
no, not right now.
thank you for your time. -- Certainly.
one thing.
why does your son have a bodyguard, mr. Cain?
well, that has to do with my work.
a couple of years ago, there was a hostile takeover and we had death threats.
Oh, you should've called us.
Hey, cal. It's Latimer.
Hey, look.
do me a favor.
will you drop by Brown and look up a student for me.
take your time.
Knapp.
well, look. We knew it was just a matter of time before somebody started knocKing on your door, Mr. Cain.
let me call you back.
which one is it, Alfred?
good job.
Hey.
I need a current on Ray Canton.
case number 3-3-5-4-0-1-0-3-2-1-0-1.
I'm looking for my brother.
I don't see the family resemblance.
there it is.
yeah?
the accounts for Canton and McKinley have been closed.
I noticed something out of place.
someone actually.
leave it for now.
what's the status on Greene?
handling the matter as we speak.
you the accountant?
I balance the books, yeah.
so...
how does this work?
all three accounts have been closed.
Hello?
we have your son.
he is alive.
if you would like to keep it that way, wait by the phone for further instructions.
and do not call the police.
please let me speak to him.
Hello?
Hello?
I just got off the phone with Roger Prince.
you know who that is?
Conrad Cain's lawyer.
the next time I go to the bathroom I'm gonna have options.
what the hell were you doing?
that is none of your business, Andy.
and I would watch my tone if I were you.
I'm still your boss till the end of this week.
you can't just go knocking on Conrad Cain's front door.
anyway, the lawyer says the kid's in Rhode island.
he said what?
the kid's in Rhode island.
I didn't go over there talking about the kid.
why is his lawyer bringing up the kid again?
I don't care, and neither should you.
after I hung up with Prince, the deputy director called.
Yeah.
that's right.
you're in the tall weeds, my man.
you need to zip up your fly.
I found your friend.
excuse me?
someone left him for dead in Staten island.
man, you look deader than the last time I saw you.
what about the boy?
what about the boy?
did the kid get on the line?
caller did all the talking.
did you get the trace?
no.
he's bouncing the call.
he's really good at it too.
you get anything on his twang?
Nope.
too much distortion.-- Call seem prepped?
he says,"if you would like to" instead of "if you'd like to.
no elisions or dangling participles, no deliberate pauses.
if I had to take a guess, I'd say the call was rehearsed.
what about Canton?
canton is clay.
so much for ask questions first.
it wasn't me who decided to move his smile to his neck.
get anything on the phones?
the maid.
her husband called twice.
and they spoke spanish.
I don't know.
I took French.
you can go through the tapes yourself.
all right. What else?
Mr. Cain's made three calls to lloyd's of london.
it turns out he has a kidnap and ransom insurance policy on Leopold.
something he might have mentioned this morning.
what about Mrs. Cain?
first, she called daddy.
but daddy wasn't available.
who's daddy?
well, normally, daddy's anybody but daddy.
but in this case, it's actually daddy.
it's her father.
she really does call him daddy.
who is he?
okay. Who's that?
read a magazine.
so when she couldn't get through to him, she tried another number.
who'd she call?
I don't know.
but they're still on the line. You wanna listen?
I need to see you.
look, Ellie. I'll fly in as soon as I can.
find out who that is.
I'm running a trace.
I'm going out.
take care of it.
he's not going anywhere.
hasn't he had enough?
he's just a kid.
do what you're told
you know I almost bought this place?
Yeah, me too. But the view sucks.
nice jump, though.
I ran a callback on that number.
Mrs. Cain?
Yeah, I got a secret service switchboard.
And?
and I hung up.
elwood called for Graham.
did you find Aubrey?
no, she was no-show at class today.
they went by her place.
her flatmates said-- housemates.
flatmates said she went away.
she went away.
Yeah, with some guy that she met at a bar.
did we get a name on the guy?
Negatory.
Oh, elmwood wanted me to let you know that he bumped into Calvin Vance at Aubrey Cain's experimental psych class.
he said you'd remember him from camp Pendleton.
he also wanted me to remind you who his sometime employer is and that you ain't the only game in town.
Mrs. Cain-- how long does it take to bring them back?
that depends.
listen, Mrs. Cain
excuse me.
Hello?
knapp, it's been a while.
that you, Latimer?
how's Barbara?
Oh, I'm looking right at her.
she's, uh, pregnant again.
big as a house, man.
Hey, listen.
are you in town?
I was thinking maybe we can get together and have some dinner or something.
actually, I'm in Kentucky.
how do you pronounce the capital city of Kentucky?
is it lou-ie-ville or lou-iss-ville?
I'm pretty sure it's lou-ie-ville.
actually, it's pronounced Frankfurt.
really amazing how many people follow the part of the note about not calling the cops.
Yeah, your wife looks great.
I wouldn't be surprised if she was carrying twins.
you're a funny guy.
great, now I gotta come up with something nice to say about him.
this is a federal investigation.
you get in my way, I'll throw you in jail.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Cain.
I tried to stop them.
I thought I made myself clear to your people.
we're here to help, Mr. Cain.
I want you out of my house now.
I'm special agent Andy Archer.
we have reason to believe that your son's been kidnapped.
we're here to help you get him back.
Mr. Cain?
has your son been abducted?
you're under no lawful obligation to answer that question.
Mr. Cain, we're the FBI.
I can understand your position-- next, he'll say he'd like to conduct interviews.
and would it be okay if you and Mrs. Cain sat for a polygraph?
what?
just so we can eliminate you as suspects.
okay, Knapp. Let's go.
easy, easy.
let him go, Knapp. Let him go.
you two know each other?
Yes.
Yeah, we used to work together.
Hello?
Mr. Cain.
listen to me.
I will give anything you want.
just let me talk to my son. Please.
he needs his medicine.
your son's medications have been provided.
if you want it to stay that way, be at church street station, Coney island.
two hours, $20 million.
Hello?
you get it?
we got a trace. It's in Brooklyn.
ent building's here.
Brooklyn heights.
mobilize swat.
sixties on white and red.
set up a command post on henry.
all swat movement is coordinated through toc.
sierra units will have the outer perimeter.
I'll give the authority to move to yellow and green.
that's a bad idea.
what's the problem?
kid's not at the apartment. He's at the drop.
the kid's not at the drop. He's at the apartment.
he's in Hoboken. He's on the moon.
what are you saying?
I'm saying we don't know what we don't know.
I'm saying we make the drop on the level.
if we don't get the kid, then we take the apartment.
I'm not letting these guys slip through our fingers.
these guys are nowhere near our fingers.
gentlemen, first we deal with the drop, and then we'll deal with the apartment.
you call swat. You get 'em in position.
nobody should move a muscle until we have Mr. Cain's son.
I've got eyes all over the package.
I'll call it out.
alright, fine
the drop is here.
church street station.
blend in with the crowd. We're on Alpha one. No chatter.
we have four train platforms.
let's keep on the move.
hold it! Just...please.
I wanna know what he thinks.
I think if you ever wanna see your kid again, there shouldn't be an agent within 100 miles of the drop.
that's not realistic, Mr. Cain.
your son is 15 years old.
he's what we call a child of tender years.
that makes this a federal case, Mr. Cain.
I understand you're scared. Your wife is scared.
we're gonna do everything we can to get your son back.
20 million in untraceable, negotiable bearer bonds.
I know.
knapp, are you there?
Yeah, I'm here.
what now?
wait.
who's got eyes in Brooklyn?
all quiet here.
Hello?
enter the local tunnel heading toward coney island.
what? Coney island.
enter the tunnel? How am I.
rich man, you figure it out.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
don't come any closer.
okay.
I have your money.
now where should I where do you want me to put it?
just leave it right there.
Where's my son?
I said where's my son?!
what the hell are you talking about? Who's your son?
look, man, I don't know nothing about your son.
not seeing the boy.
I'm seeing a man down in the tunnel.
we're taking the house.-- No, not yet. Not yet.
do we have the bag man?
I'm not sure what we've got. Just hold up, andy.
he's not the guy. What do you mean he's not the guy?
what's going on? Where's Leopold?
we're moving in.
not right now. Not now!
he didn't say nothing about no Leopold.
I'm the primary relief supervisor. It's my call.
this guy, he slips me a c-note, says they'll be five more like it if I come down here and
and what? Deliver a letter.
it's a set-up.
it's a set-up!
nice seeing you in Brooklyn
Hello?
you just killed your son.
Hey, stupid.
nice work. You did exactly what they wanted you to do.
he had a trace.
the trace was a come-on.
to get you to stick your head out and sign their guest book.
they saw you and sent the bag man home.
what? It was his call and he made it.
and it was the right call.
Ah, come on, Latimer!-- Come on, nothing.
it just didn't work out the right way.
Yeah, that's the problem with you people and your rulebook.
what you can't seem to understand is you're the only ones playing by the rules.
you okay?
Yeah.
good.
cause if you ever pull a stunt like that again, I will end you.
let's put a detail on the residence, taps on the phones, and surveillance on Knapp.
what happened to retirement?
Yeah, what happened to retirement?
business as usual out there.
people going to bed in one place.

it was Shurik who toId us this story.
on one of his expeditions, he coIIected the foIkIore and Iegends of the Iand...
this story may, in fact, be onIy a Iegend, but Shurik insists it reaIIy did occur in one of mountainous regions.
he didn't specify which region it was, because he wanted to be fair to aII the other regions where such story might have happened.
go on!
where are you going?
damn it!
what made me agree to drive this oId asthmatic vacuum cIeaner?
don't Iose hope!
I remember what the great and wise Abou-Akhmat-ibn-Bey said, who was the first driver of that machine. He said: " Edik... "
Edik. - Shurik.
so he said to me, " Edik, onIy AIIah himseIf knows where goes the spark of this degenerate in the famiIy of internaI-combustion engines. "
may its carburetor go dead forever!
pardon me... - Yes?
excuse me...
wouId you mind... - Yes?
wiII you pIease not zig zag, and stay on the road?
Why? - My donkey's foIIowing you.
so it's your donkey who pursued me? - That's right.
and I had the impression... - No, it's him!
are you from around here? - Yes, I'm here on vacation.
I'm here on business. How far is the town? - 2 kiIometers.
thanks very much. Goodbye now. - Have a nice time.
come on... Move!
you see, he won't budge unIess you go first.
year of birth? - 1942.
purpose of your visit? - Ethnological research.
I see... Looking for oiI? - No. I'm Iooking for foIkIore.
I'm making records of your oId taIes, Iegends, toasts.
Toasts?!
my dear man, you're in Iuck... I can heIp you.
cIosed for Iunch
what's this?
you want a good toast? - Yes.
a toast without wine is the same as a wedding without a bride.
no, I don't drink. - Who drinks?
this isn't drinking.
you didn't understand. I don't drink at aII.
you see, I'm not physicaIIy abIe to.
this wiII make my first toast.
a toast? I'II copy it. - You'II do it Iater. Take this gIass.
my great grandfather aIways said:
'I desire to buy a house, but I don't have the means to do it.
I have the means to purchase a goat, but I don't desire it. "
so Iet us drink to our desires aIways meeting our possibiIities.
good for you. - Right...
now, here's another toast. - Right...
I'II be right back. - Take your time. I'II breathe a bit.
I'II get some fresh air, a break from sitting in my office aII the time.
aIways the office...
where have you been? - Something wrong?
my niece. - A pIeasure to meet you.
Nina.
she's studying to be a teacher. - Teaching those who'II take our pIace.
exceiient student, KomsomoI member, athIetic girI.
AthIetic? - UncIe knows everything about me.
you're just what we need. - And what do you need?
let me ask you a question, a question you'd probabIy not expect.
go ahead.
what do you think of marriage? - I think of it positiveIy.
she's too young to think about it.
it's never too earIy, and never too Iate. Go get the car started.
what's your opinion about our inauguration of a new Wedding PaIace?
I'II be there for sure. - WiII you?
I may ask you for a favor, a smaII one, but important.
what is it? - I'II teII you Iater. See you there.
aII right.
and when the whoIe fIock migrated to the south, one smaII but proud bird said:
'as for me, I shaII head up to the sun. "
and he started upward, he fIew upward, upward, but soon the heat of the sun burnt his wings, and he dropped down to the bottom of a very deep canyon.
so my toast is that no one of us, no matter how high you get, ever fIy too far from the rest of the coIIective.
what's wrong with him? - What's wrong?
so sorry for the bird!
the princess was so angered that she hanged herseIf, because he had counted the exact totaI of grains in the sack, the exact sum of drops in the sea, and the totaI of stars gIeaming.
so I propose a toast to cybernetics!
have one, pIease.
for you!
wedding PaIace
dear friends!
today is a great and joyous day...
a beautifuI day.
in just a few seconds, these siIver shears wiII cut this red siIken ribbon and, thus, open to aII the newIy weds of our region the road to the radiant future, the road to happiness, to Iove, to accord, through our Wedding PaIace.
to inaugurate the paIace then...
we agreed among ourseIves...
that the honor of inaugurating our paIace wouId be conferred upon a fine girI who represents a new generation of mountainous women.
she is a student... a KomsomoI member... an athIete...
and with aII this, she's just a beauty.
you see what I meant by a smaII, but important favor. WouId you...
pIease.
and to quote our wonderfuI satirist, Arkady Raikin, "a woman is a friend of man."
just a minute... Just one minute...
wouId you speak a bit more sIowIy. I'm taking this down.
who is he?
must be a reporter. - Ah, a reporter!
aII right, to quote Arkady Raikin, "a woman is a friend of man."
Hooray for you! We must drink a toast to girIs...
give that back! Give me back my horn, I teII you!
that's my horn!
he was the cause of the faiIure of the Wedding PaIace ceremony.
then, upon the ruins ofthe chapeI...
excuse me... Did I destroy the chapeI too?
no, that was done in the 14th century.
as I was saying, upon the ruins of the chapeI...
this is aII quite right. Yes, it's aII exact.
everything is put down correctIy. It's perfect, very good.
but it's onIy one side of the case. And what's the other side?
this feIon is not a feIon, he's a great man of science, he's an inteIIectuaI. He has come to visit us.
he's gathering stories... Iegends, you know... toasts.
Toasts? - Yes, toasts.
I guess he overestimated his potentiaI, right?
what we have here is an on-the-job accident.
I've got a magnificent toast.
hoteI
you have a very wrong idea about our region.
everybody knows the Kuzbass is...
kuzbass is the forge of the Soviet Union, right?
Kuban is our granary...
and Caucasus is... what? - Our sanatorium!
sanatorium? No!
caucasus is the forge, the granary and the sanatorium of the Soviet Union.
my dear friend, where did you disappear?
last night I remembered a spIendid oId toast. Come aIong.
wait. I must speak to Shurik. Why don't you put down your toast, and make three copies of it, and present it in writing.
I'II do it!
it's my dream to record some ancient ceremony.
it wouId be great if I couId take part in it.
listen, where can we find it... Look around at what's going on.
no, in our region, the oId ways and traditions are dead.
perhaps high up in the mountains, you might find something for your science, but not down here.
then I'II go up there. - Right. It's your job, isn't it?
you've come here to record fairy taIes, and we are working here to make fairy taIes reaI.
yes?
I've brought the toast.
feeIing bad, eh?
who gave you permission? - You toId me to bring three copies.
life is grand, isn't it?
and the grand Iife is even better! - You're right!
administrator of RegionaI Economy B. G. Saakhov
aren't you ashamed of yourseIf? You'd cheat a poor orphan?
she got nobody but her uncIe and aunt. Twenty five.
I respect your niece, but there're Iimits to everything.
eighteen. - Have you got no shame?
after aII, you're getting not a goat, but a wife, and what a wife!
a student, a KomsomoI member, an athIete, a beauty...
and for aII that I'm asking 25 sheep. It's a reaI bargain!
that's a bad poIiticaI reasoning. You are bIind to the poIiticaI situation.
you see Iife through the windows of my personaI automobiIe.
25 sheep when our region hasn't fuIfiIIed the pIan in meat and wooI?
don't mix up your own sheep with those of the State.
by the way, my dear DzhabraiI,
I'm pIaced here to keep a watch over the State's interests.
sit down for now.
where were we...
twenty sheep. - Twenty five.
twenty.
I'II aIso give you a refrigerator... A certificate of merit...
and a free trip somepIace... - To Siberia.
aII right. - AII right.
let's see now.
the bridegroom agrees... Her reIatives agree, too.
but... the bride herseIf...
Yes, young peopIe today are brought up badIy, yes, badIy.
they have siIIy views on marriage.
why must we ask her opinion? Put a sack over her and... whoosh!
that's a good idea.
a very good idea.
but I can't be part of it.
don't worry. It wiII be done by outsiders.
Yes, and not from around here. - Trust me.
dancing SchooI. Price based on tariff. Tariff: 1 rubIe.
this is the twist, not the Iezghinka. Watch me again.
with your right toe, you crush the butt of a cigarette.
like this.
another butt... you crush with your Ieft toe.
now you crush both butts.
dancing SchooI. Price based on tariff. Tariff: 1 rubIe.
MuItiboard Game. Price based on tariff. Tariff: 1 rubIe.
you Iost.
you soId her? - None of your business!
wait a minute... weII...
I bet it passes... A bit to my right...
there.
forward!
the sheep in the stabIe, the fridge in the house.
where are you going?
get back in the house.
you won't get away with this.
kidnapping such a wonderfuI girI... - An athIete, a KomsomoI member...
by the way, in my town a man kidnapped a girI who was a Party member.
Shurik, you're making a great deaI of progress.
Oh, it's nothing at aII. - Nothing at aII?
reaI nothing. I was secured.
weII, I'II have to give you a harder task.
what is it?
hop into your sIeeping bag. As quick as possibIe.
just a second. We'II time it. - Right.
weII, get ready. On your mark... Go!
time!
are you going to sIeep standing?
I'm timing you.
watch out!
Shurik! Stay where you are! I'II save you!
there're two of them.
the third one's got a taiI... - Don't count the donkey.
the second one is one too many. - A witness.
and what if...
we can't murder him. - We'd better wait.
right, we'II wait. You deal.
what is this? Is it foIkIore? - No, it's a student song.
a song about bears.
it couIdn't be usefuI to you. - It can. It's students' foIkIore.
come on, sing it.
aII right, Iisten.
somewhere in a distant corner, In the frozen North,
bears rub their bodies Against the axis of Earth.
passing by them are eras, SIeeping are the seas ice-bound.
bears rub their bodies, The earth goes spinning around.
the earth goes round and round.
they turn the earth around With aII their bear's might,
so that aII the Iovers Sooner couId meet and unite.
so that one sunny morning, One year earIier, or two,
he couId say, " I Iove you " , And she: " I Iove you, too. "
after an ApriI shower, Sooner wiII come the dawn.
and for the two happy Iovers, As the time goes on,
the sun wiII shine forever, The days wiII aII be fair,
the fog wiII curI in a vaIIey, Snow-white as a bear.
somewhere in a distant corner, In the frozen North,
bears rub their bodies Against the axis of Earth.
passing by them are eras, SIeeping are the seas ice-bound.
bears rub their bodies, The earth goes spinning around.
the earth goes round and round.
the earth goes round and round.

it's been fun.
goodbye, Nina. - Goodbye!
Nina!
wait, Nina. - What is it, Shurik?
I'm going to take you to your camp.
you didn't Iive up to the trust I put in you.
it was impossibIe. - You set us an unattainabIe goaI.
if you ask me... it was voIuntarism.
watch your Ianguage in my house!
what did I say?
Aha! Fine!
there's your money!
we quit! Take your money!
take it!
here's your money. - Wait a minute.

you won't Iose your way, wiII you?
good night.
Oh, heIIo, Shurik. - Good evening.
What'II you have? - Nothing. AIyosha, a bottIe of wine.
you're a Iucky man. - Why?
you wanted to see an oId ceremony? - Of course, it wouId be great.

you'II be abIe not onIy to see it, you may aIso take part in it.
I don't know how to thank you.
wouId you Iike some juice? - No.
what exactIy is this ceremony? - Bride kidnapping.
don't think it's something bad. The bride dreams of it.
her parents have agreed, too. Of course, they can go get registered...
but first the bride shouId be stoIen. - StoIen?
a beautifuI tradition.
and what do I do in aII this?
you'II be the kidnapper... - Kidnap?
carry her off in a sack... - In a sack? Is this the tradition?
it's great!

I'd Iike you to meet these friends. - Sure.
the groom's friends. - Shurik.
Shurik.
Shurik.
PIease, join us.

they'II kiII you.

Nina? The bride's name is Nina? - Yes, Nina, my niece.

they're so mad about each other.
Oh, I just remembered. Tomorrow I'm busy...
you must excuse me. I can't do it.
no, it's impossibIe.
look here, Shurik. - What?
I must teII you this...
Nina wants you to do it.
Nina... asked me to do it?
that's right.
in that case, you can teII Nina... that I'II do it.
goodbye.
remember, the custom demands that everything Iook naturaI.
the bride wiII resist, kick back and even bite you.
she'II yeII for the poIice and say she'II fiIe a compIaint against you.
don't pay any attention, it's a beautifuI oId custom.
I understand.
don't worry. Everything wiII Iook naturaI.

Shurik...

I'm here to say goodbye.
goodbye, Shurik.
FareweII, Nina.

you're some joker. I bet you'II prepare shish kebab from this bride.
don't forget to invite me.
EagIe's Nest - 57 km
you mean there's no such custom?
she was reaIIy kidnapped? - Yes.
who did it then? Oh yes... Who's the suitor?
we find out who'II be our husband onIy at the wedding.
there wiII be no wedding!
I kidnapped her, so I'II go and rescue her.
Shurik!

how couId I know it was for reaI? - I'II take care of the case myseIf.
this man, this groom is a rat!
you don't know who he is, do you? You don't?
too bad. He's an immoraI scoundre.
thank you for aIerting us. This depIorabIe exampIe wiII heIp us to raIIy up the masses.
right. And I'm going to the poIice.
you can't! They'II arrest you immediateIy.
they wiII be obIiged to pIace you under arrest. They wiII.
do you have money?
you'II have to get away. Saving Nina wiII become my business.
those scoundreIs wiII go on triaI, and you'II come to it as our witness.
no, I cannot take advantage of your magnanimity.
my magnanimity? - You'd be risking covering for me.
I was the kidnapper, so I have to make up for my guiIt.

this is a very serious form of iIIness.
you must save this man, it's very important.
I swear to you.
because of his aIcohoIism, he's obsessed by a pecuIiar idea.
the idea of a kidnapped bride whom he says he must save.
he's compIeteIy crazy, beIieve me.
signs of deIirium tremens. - Yes, deIirious, and he trembIes.
don't worry. Give us three days and we'II have him cured.

it's important to make him weII and give the society an abIe man.
so don't be in a hurry. - We'II do our best.
goodbye. - Goodbye.
if I ever were a suItan, I wouId have three wives.
and surrounded by three beauties, I wouId thrive.
on the other hand again, If I went that far,
I wouId get in so much troubIe, save me, oh, AIIah!
Yes, to have many wives seems to be aII right,
but it Iooks very bad on the other side.
everything is aII right.
you can come over.
there's a question for us suItans, most important in Iife:
how many wives to have, three wives or one wife?
and the answer to this question, cIear as a day:
if I ever were a suItan, singIe I wouId stay.
Yes, to have no wife seems to be aII right.
it is perfect for me just on every side.
Yes, to have no wife seems to be aII right.
it is perfect for me just on every side.
open up!
so that's how it is. AII right...

comrade Saakhov's diagnosis seems to be absoIuteIy right.
Saakhov? Did you say, Saakhov?
Yes, Saakhov.
so it was him who got me in here? - He sent you here in time of crisis.
a serious one. - Right, it was a serious crisis.
I'II teII you the truth.
Saakhov is the one who kidnapped the girI.
of course, he did. He kidnapped her and buried her.

AIcohoIics are our speciaIty.
get me out of this.
promise to be reasonabIe, and not try anything?
you can undo him.
I see. You don't beIieve me.

Where's the prosecutor? - In Ward 6, in NapoIeon's pIace.

there are ninety-six pieces...
you have no shame...
you don't give a damn about our customs.
what?
you're stupid... You've got no choice.
you think someone wiII be searching for you?
the first person they'II ask wiII be me, your onIy reIation.
and I'II say you Ieft the schooI, got married and went away.
I'II teII you something eIse. Keep quiet and Iisten when I speak to you!
either you Ieave here as the wife of comrade Saa...
lucky girI that you are! Or you remain in there forever.
that's better. That's a good girI.
open the door and meet the man who'II become your husband.
take it off! - What?
take offthe hat!
look here, I'm distressed. I'm very hurt.
I just went in...
she's young and capricious. - No, she's insoIent!
there're onIy two ways I can go from this house:
either I take her to the marriage registry office...
or she takes me to the prosecutor's.
no, not that! - I don't want it either.
aII right, you wiII see. Tomorrow she'II feeI hungry.
in a week, she'II be bored, and in a month she'II give in.
we can wait. - Yes, we can wait.
remember, comrades!
you must prove worthy of our trust.
I'II hoId you responsibIe for her.
we'II do our best, dear comrade DzhabraiI.

good evening...
I never thought you'd visit me. It's a very pIeasant surprise.
I think I'd better change.
don't bother. They'II attend to that at the morgue.
we are here to judge you by the Iaw of the mountains, because you have sought to bring dishonor on us.
you shaII die Iike the jackaI you are.
you haven't the right! You'II answer for this!
I shaII answer for it onIy to my consciousness as a true mountaineer...
...to my sister's honor and to the memory of my ancestors.
Nina! Don't Iet them do it.
this is a barbarity. I know that I've broken the code, but I'm ready to admit my fauIt.
that won't be enough, you shaII pay for it... with your Iife!
you haven't the right. You haven't the right!
this is the mob Iaw! I demand to be judged by the Soviet Iaw!
did you buy her according to the Soviet Iaw?
or did you have her kidnapped by the Soviet Iaw?
let's cut this ridicuIous discussion short. Sister, turn on the sound.
let's begin.
No! No, pIease!
don't do that, I beg you not to. I won't do it again.
I promise.

Ah, HamIet, weII done.

Yes, onIy saIt.
PIease, stand up! The court is in session!

the earth goes round and round.
a hundred and fifty years ago, the Gates Falls Mill stood here.
it employed 200 men and women.
good Yankees, all.
Sixteen-hour shifts during the Civil War when the Gates Falls Mill made uniforms for the Union Army.
the job of the men wearing those uniforms was to end the peculiar institution.
the peculiar institution being slavery.
when the mill burned in 1869 most of them got out.
the fire started in the first floor.
most of the adult mill workers escaped.
most of the children...
most of the children did not.
this is the realm of darkness.
years later, a hospital was built here.
kingdom Hospital.
the bleaching and dyeing vats have given way to doctors and researchers...
and operating rooms filled with modern equipment.
here, life is charted with lasers and EKGs and MRIs.
there is no place for superstition.
rational thought has replaced whispered myths about the unquiet, hungry dead.
but there is such a thing as intellectual arrogance.
and arrogance is blind.
perhaps the ground Kingdom Hospital stands on...
is still uneasy...
for the cold and damp have returned.
time for your enema, Mr. Stillmach.
by tonight, that impacted colon will be a thing of the past.
ls someone there?
little girl?
Girl-watching is thirsty work. l brought you this.
you scared the hell out of me.
problem with the elevators?
with 2, always 2.
hook, did you just see a little girl, in the hallway, maybe?
l didn't see anyone. But then, half the lights are out again.
Abel to Security.
lt's Otto. -And Hook.
the lights are out in West 1 .
and Elevator 2 is acting up again.
and Blondie, did you see him?
no.
flipping a breaker isn't a solution. lt's only a Band-Aid.
did you see a little girl?
lf kids are wandering out of Paeds, Dr. James is going to be very unhappy.
l have never seen Dr. James unhappy.
there you are. I've been so worried about you.
hon, stay on the lane, okay? l hate it when you run on the main road.
lt's October, in case you haven't noticed.
there's no traffic on the main road.
all the summer people went home a month ago...
God bless their pointy little heads.
well, still, it makes me nervous, so just stay on the lane, okay?
l suppose l could. - Great.
and by the way, you were great. - So were you.
see you later. - Peter, what are you painting?
the new, strange one?
how many times have l told you? l don't like it.
l know, you don't like me looking at your works-in-progress, but l peeked.
lt's weird. You know it's weird, because you never cover your paintings.
l'm going. See you later.
hon. l didn't mean to piss you off.
quit it, Charlie. Get out of that.
damn it, Charlie, that's my dinner.
get out of there, Charlie.
get out of there.
Hey, help me up here, would you?
my hip hurts a little bit.
I think you might have brushed me going by.
come on, fellow, help me. Just a close call.
l'm sorry, man. l'm really sorry.
quit gibbering and help me get up.
I think I sprained my hip getting out of the way, and my back hurts a little.
Oh, my God. Did you really hit me?
l can't deal with this right now, man, okay?
l got 1 2 points and a DUl on my license already...
and there's an ounce in my glove compartment.
what are you talking about? Help me.
lt's not really primo stuff or anything, but an ounce is an ounce, right?
besides, someone will come along pretty soon.
what the hell are you talking about?
I think I'm really hurt here. Help me, you son of a bitch.
l mean, even out here, right? Someone always does, eventually.
l'm sorry l hit you, man.
l'm really sorry, man.
what were you doing, running in the middle of the road, anyhow?
can I move my...
no.
bug out of here.
Hey, stop. I need help.
I'm down here.
get off me.
you look pretty tasty.
get away from me.
I think I'll start with your eyes.
get away from me.
yum. " Ant-solutely " delicious.
please, don't hurt me.
you're a real mess, my friend. I mean, seriously racked up.
please.
save your strength. That would be my advice.
you'll need it.
help me.
you'll be all right, fellow. Just lie still.
I think I'm paralysed. Can you...
you'll be all right. You'll be fine.
I'm not actually talking, am I?
this is bad.
l'm just going to go call for a... Just try not to move.
this is really bad.
lf there's a Smokey or a mobile EMT unit with your ears on...
I got a seriously injured fellow here on Route 7.
l got you, good buddy.
he's on the shoulder and
good. Block him from oncoming traffic...
with your truck. Don't run him down.
l don't think the company would be too crazy about
just do it. l'll call the Sheriff's Department
this is Deputy Frank Downes, Oxford County Sheriff's Department.
I have my ears on and am en route. Copy.
all right, so are we, Deputy Downes.
kingdom, this is Castleview 19. Do you read?
Five-by-five, 19.
we're going mobile.
sir, can you hear me?
sir, can you move your arms and legs?
how's he looking?
the right pupil is fixed and dilated.
the left pupil... l don't know.
say again, Ollie? lt is Ollie, isn't it?
Yeah, it's Ollie and Danny.
all right. Never mind his eyes. What about an airway? ls he breathing?
do you copy, Ollie? What else have you got? ls he conscious?
l don't know what to say. His eyes are open, but...
lt's not the same thing, Ollie.
Yeah, sorry about that, Kingdom. We've got a multi-trauma.
major head injuries. He's breathing, dazed, but conscious, probably shocky.
minimally responsive, compound fractures to the ribs, both tibia.
fracture to both ankles. Looks like his pelvis is fractured as well.
but it's hard to tell. We've got multiple head injuries.
bp is 78 over 44, it's going down.
respiration is, l'm going to say, 32.
he's tachy. - Heartbeat clocking 140. Make that 150.
all right, get a line in him, Danny. Colour? Saturation?
his eyes are open and he's still looking around, but
there's Ollie the ophthalmologist with more eye data.
got the line?
line's in.
normal saline, wide open.
four milligrams morphine, lV Push, PRN.
lmmobilize that spine with a collar, side head supports, and straps.
be very careful.
okay, that's a roger.
the respiration is rapid and shallow.
Oh, yeah.
easy.
did he say anything about who hit him?
no, man, he didn't say anything.
easy. There we go.
sugar. Ollie, he's going to crump on me. Can you...
do you want me to pull over?
l got it, l'm styling. Just get us there.
watch for Mary. Listen for her bell.
it's a death bell.
l'm bagging away here, but l'm getting airway resistance.
has his trachea deviated?
big time, to the right.
Fudgebar. He's going V-Fib.
the fun never ends, huh?
clear.
come on, Danny.
ladies and gentlemen, we're back.
Liz, get a cutdown tray ready for chest tube insertion, please.
you okay with this one?
he's okay with this one. You have a case. -Druse.
again?
mama. - Hush up, Bobby. This could be serious.
l've got pins and needles all up my right arm.
there. lsn't it lovely?
ready? And one, two, three, up.
sweatpants, no pockets. We can't do a wallet biopsy on this one.
l know who he is.
you want me to guess? ls there a prize? -l can't get air in him.
l know. -Really? Want to share?
his name's Peter Rickman. He lives in Castleview. He's a famous artist.
Liz, could l get an 18-gauge needle, please? No syringe, just the needle.
are you-- -Yes.
tension pneumo, Elmer. Pleural sac is inflating like a beach ball.
time for a party trick.
may l be excused? Never mind.
Mr. Rickman, can you hear me?
now, don't move. Just blink your eyes if you can hear me.
Thanks.
please, let this be a dream.
l want a dozen double-stuffed Oreos, lV push...
ready with 1, 000 milligrams of peanut butter crackers and two amps of Nestle's Quik.
good afternoon.
hello.
my name is Christine Draper. l'm a neurosurgeon.
Sally Druse.
are you a good doctor? As good as Dr. Hook?
no problem there. Your hand's acting up?
Yeah.
needles and pins.
and l need it for my pendulum.
l'm psychic. l've been written up in several magazines.
patient complains of needles and pins.
noodles and prunes.
he's got one hell of a blood puddle in there.
l'm surprised the blow didn't crack his skull wide open.
first, we open our craniotomy and then we excavate the haematoma.
Capisci, Elmer?
Yeah.
okay, there it is, Elmer.
l always pause here and imagine that l am the first neurosurgeon.
the first to boldly journey into the workings of a human mind.
cool.
Yes, it is.
lnside this skull is another universe...
the biggest, scariest haunted house of them all.
Elmer, will you hurry up and tell Dr. Hook how profound he is...
so we can get inside this poor guy's noggin and reduce the cranial pressure?
anyway, after l've paused to reflect on the gravity of what it is l am about to do...
and only after l've done that, do l proceed with my mission.
Yes, Doctor.
steady as you go, Otto.
patient to Nine, Neuro.
standing by.
you'll be fine, Mrs. D.
Yeah, l will. You tell Bobby not to worry. Bye-bye.
these things are so slow.
mommy.
someone was crying in the Children's Ward?
we call it Paediatrics these days, Mrs. Druse.
well, whatever you call it, it sounded like it was right on top of the elevator.
a little girl.
l see.
lt's very hard to get a place in here.
a gusher!
mop. lrrigation people, come on. Don't let this man drown.
come on, you're up, Elmer. Jump in here, please.
that's not my job. -Your union steward is not on duty today.
lf you wouldn't mind jumping in, right about now.
come on, son.
right there.
very nice.
are you seeing what l'm seeing?
we took those photos less than an hour ago.
why is the size of the haematoma in that scan...
three times the size of the one in this man's skull?
lt's like the whole mess is healing itself at warp speed.
the home number was unlisted, but Rickman was in the ER last year...
with a badly cut finger, and his wife had a Pap smear. Dr. Willock.
Dr. Willock, excellent. And who's taking care of this fellow now?
lt's not Dr. Stegman, is it?
no. Steg isn't in. l believe Hook.
hook? Excellent.
do you think so? - Yes, indeed.
you say this Peter Rickman is quite well-known?
Yes. ln fact, here.
l included this, in case you hadn't seen it.
l see.
thank you, Brenda. Quick work, and even quicker thinking.
thank you for this. Here, take this, and one of these...
and, of course, one of these, for your car window.
aren't they wonderful? Aren't they really excellent?
very nice.
Jesse, if this works out, the Rickmans are in a position to give Kingdom Hospital a great deal of help.
filthy rich, are they?
l don't know if l'd say that, exactly, but... - No, but just between us?
excuse me, Jesse. l've got to run. - Have a great day.
have yourself a " morning air " day. - l will.
filthy rich.
let's call a spade a spade and a chicken a chicken.
Julie, call me the minute that Peter Rickman is out of the OR.
the very minute. -Yes, Dr. James.
perhaps you can get me an update on Hook's progress.
Yes, Dr. James.
okay, Elmer, there it is.
a three-pound universe.
what do you know?
go back to sleep.
that nurse down there is no longer dancing to the sound of the Big Brass Band.
would you mind squirreling her away in a corner, please? Thank you.
what the hell did you just do?
l don't know.
how the hell should I know? I'm just the dog.
hook.
Yeah. Just slow down, Otto.
l'm on my way.
Mrs. Rickman, l assure you
are you my husband's doctor? -That would be Hook.
he was on call when Mr. Rickman was admitted.
a neurosurgeon, one of the finest on staff. - l want to speak to him.
he's waiting for us, Mrs. Rickman.
I don't judge the living or the dead.
Antibus.
I grant wishes, prayers and dreams.
guardian of the gate.
am I going to die?
this is Kingdom Hospital...
which stands on uneasy ground.
here, the cold and damp have returned.
and as the gate swings open...
the dead may also return.
l'm going to give you a few moments alone with your husband now, if you'd like that.
would you like that? - Yes.
l would like that, Doctor-- -Hook.
now, you can speak to your husband, but...
he will almost certainly not answer...
although he may open his eyes.
ls he in a coma?
he's not conscious or responsive now, but that is not unusual after trauma and surgery.
now, time may prove me wrong, but l don't expect him to be in a coma.
ls he awful?
no.
you handled that brilliantly, Hook.
and thanks for putting him in the...
the Presidential Suite is what they call it up here.
excuse me.
l'll just let you handle this, then, shall l?
make one of the Kingdom apartments available to her...
if that's appropriate. There are lots of vacancies.
look at you.
just look at you.
Oh, baby.
l didn't mean to piss you off this afternoon.
l really didn't.
can you hear me, baby?
honey?
Peter, can you hear me?
honey?
can you hear me?
I'm here, baby.
the artist has seen the other one. - He's seen Paul?
Hello, Lenny.
Lenny, how are you?
Lenny, it's Sally.
come back, Lenny. lt's Sally. Come back.
move your jack.
cover that bitch.
Yes.
good. Lovely.
l've returned, and it's a good thing, too, Lenny.
the vibrations have changed. They're not good here.
l heard this little child crying in the elevator.
could be a little girl from the Children's Ward, but...
l think that Kingdom Hospital is haunted.
haunted?
there's no time to lose. You have to tell the others.
Sally, you're back. - Lenny.
Oh, yes, Lenny.
Yes, darling, l'm back, and we are going to set things right.
you can count on me.
thank you.
can l stay with him tonight? -No.
but...
the hospital keeps apartments across the street...
and l can arrange for you to stay in one of those, if you'd like.
you treated him? -l was the admitting surgeon, yes.
your husband had a buildup of blood on his brain, a haematoma.
that's what caused his intercranial pressure rise.
we fixed that, we hope.
he has more surgery ahead of him.
tomorrow, he'll be in the OR again, with Dr. Freeman.
Dr. Freeman's an orthopod.
he has multiple fractures of his lower extremities.
both his right and his left tibia...
his right malleolus, and his pelvis is fractured.
ls he in pain?
he's receiving medication, which relieves the pain.
morphine?
l'm afraid that your husband's spine...
and skull were also severely damaged.
will he be able to walk?
will he be able to use his hands?
because...
my husband is a painter.
his spine was damaged between the fourth and the fifth cervical vertebrae.
the good news is that his ability to breathe seems unimpaired.
the bad news is that, up to this point, he has shown...
no ability to move his arms or his legs, and no response to stimuli...
the prick of a pin, for instance.
but we're still in the first 24 hours, post-accident.
Dr. Hook, when my husband wakes up, will he be a quadriplegic?
we're hopeful that the spine is only compressed.
lf that's the case...
then your husband may recover some use of his arms and his legs.
but in this type of accident, we are very worried...
the damage may be permanent.
permanent?
Oh, my God.
l'm so sorry to tell you this.
wait a minute. You...
compressed is better than broken or fractured. Am l correct?
lf the spine is only compressed...
then he may recover some limited use of his arms and his legs.
what are the chances of it being a compression rather than a fracture?
not good.
how not good?
l don't want to discourage you with statistics, Mrs. Rickman.
statistics are for groups. Your husband is one talented, driven man.
his chances are 100%...
or zero.
and we have to be ready for the zero.
l'm sorry. - You're sorry?
you're so sorry? Why do you keep saying that?
because there's nothing else.
the chances that your husband will wake up and be the same old Peter are small.
and the chances that he will walk again, or paint, are also small.
although, of course, we're hopeful.
the chances that he will be his old self, and walk...
infinitesimal.
l am still so sorry to tell you these things.
l'm all right.
we can afford the best possible treatment...
that money can buy...
but we would be glad if...
l would be glad if you would stick by him...
at least to begin with.
thank you.
you mentioned something about apartments.
l'm going to need one of those.
open-ended.
he's a fighter. -Good.
okay, Ron, it's time to beat the chair and win $10, 000.
are you ready?
I'm ready, Gene.
for $10, 000...
who starred in the suspense thriller Three Days of the Condor?
Dustin Hoffman?
I'm sorry, Ron. Robert Redford.
what a sport.
this is all your fault. lf it wasn't for you, Charlie...
somebody in here?
this is so wasted.
Bobby, isn't it a beautiful morning?
you promised you'd stop. Never again, you said.
this is where l work.
Yes, but this time, l think l really am ill.
still now, Mrs. Druse.
still as a mouse.
the world is full of mysteries.
'temporary physician's parking. " Right.
Hey, nice one.
ldiots.
why don't you learn how to drive?
stop that.
sorry, Dad. l...
look, Dr. Stegman is clearly not coming.
we've all got a lot to do. Let's start.
he's got a heavy caseload. You can't expect him here on the dot.
as he has no neurological complaint, his mental condition...
is irrelevant to this meeting.
come on, Brenda. Let's start.
lncompetent system.
l should have just been issued a windshield sticker.
check this out.
Boston.
general.
why don't you go collect your welfare checks?
this is a hospital zone.
look at him.
how's the famous artist, Hook?
he is stable.
l admitted Eleanor Druse yesterday.
good-time Sally's back in town.
she's presenting with numbness of the right arm and possible neurological insults.
what is this, her tenth admission? And that's just since l've been here.
sooner or later, the little girl who cries wolf is telling the truth.
l've ordered an MRl.
don't be silly, Christine.
only the Chief of Neuro can order an MRl. You know that.
that's not true, actually.
what do you mean?
l did it. At 7: 10 this morning.
l signed off on the paperwork.
surely not in Steg's name?
how do l know what it looked like to the tech on duty?
come on, Brenda.
kingdom Hospital Neuro can't grind to a halt because Steg oversleeps.
don't look at him.
Hey, Doc, you're losing it.
what's up, Doc?
you should be sterilized.
at least then you couldn't breed.
Hey, you forgot something, Doc.
maintenance.
this is where l work. Will you try to remember that, Mama?
Yes, Bobby.
you're a bit of a crackpot, l guess.
but l'm very fond of you.
l have some work to do up here, so... - Honey, don't worry about me.
l'll be fine. l know my way around this place like the back of my hand.
Mr. Goode, l'd like to report... - Johnny's not here.
l'm just holding down the seat for him. - Where may l find him?
l heard there was a pipe burst in the new underground parking garage.
the one they're building for the docs? l heard the place is filling up with water.
lt'll set construction back six weeks, probably more, with winter coming on.
doc, l hope you've got yourself a really big ice scraper...
cause winter could start any time now, and up here, the winters are long.
lt's not like Boston. -Up here, very little is like Boston, l find.
that's the way we like it.
there's a crack in the parking lot.
you know what? l got one of those, too.
ln the back of my pants.
hold on, Doc. You got to fill out a maintenance form, 44-B.
Johnny should have one here somewhere, but...
you know what? You better take a seat. This will just take a minute.
my name is Stegman. Dr. Stegman, Chief of Neurosciences.
pleased to meet you, Doc. Earl Swinton.
l don't know where he keeps these things.
lt's got to be here somewhere.
hell.
Hello? ls somebody there?
ls somebody there?
who are you?
what are you?
who's there? Please.
you're frightening me.
can't you stop that, man? This is a hospital.
Abel to Security.
abel, are you down there?
Abel to Security.
l'm not afraid of you.
l'm not frightened of you!
l'm interested in getting some hours in the sleep lab.
l only sign off on the paperwork, Elmer, as l think you know.
good luck.
Dr. Massingale. l heard you need volunteers in the sleep lab.
Elmer, that depends.
on what?
whether you're interested in working or flirting.
you've got a bit of a reputation, l'm afraid.
as a flirter? - And for being a practical joker.
l'll be the best sleeper in the house.
okay, but you...
what's going on, may l ask?
we waited, and then we held the meeting without you.
really, Dr. Hook? Very funny.
but regardless of what Dr. Hook says...
the meeting begins when l arrive. lt ends when l leave.
any questions?
have a seat.
any time.
any admissions since yesterday?
Peter Rickman, age 41 . accident.
brought in late afternoon just after you left for the day, Dr. Stegman.
the patient is presenting... - l know what he's presenting with.
l read the papers, Dr. Hook. How's his nut?
his " nut, " as you say, is banged up.
how severely has yet to be ascertained.
why don't you run some tests? l may have to operate later. Anyone else?
Sally Druse, age 65, mildly hypertensive...
presenting with numbness of the right arm, possible paresis, paraesthesia, or neuralgia.
l've ordered an MRl.
l beg your pardon?
'm " as in " Map, " " R " as in " Rat, " " l " as in " ldiot. "
only one person in this department has the right to order an MRl.
and that person is me.
cancel it immediately, please. - l can't.
what did you say?
lt's already happened. lf you'd been in for early rounds
l have disliked your attitude for the last six weeks, since l've been here, Dr. Hook.
l'm sorry to hear that, Dr. Stegman.
you're insubordinate and arrogant. l'll have your job for this.
l think that went well, don't you?
aren't you worried?
l got 1 2 points and a DUl on my license already...
what are you doing, running in the middle of the road, anyhow?
'Ant-solutely " delicious.
Fudgebar. He's going V-Fib.
come on, Danny, are we open...
listen. It's a death bell.
wake up.
open your eyes.
no.
I do you a solid, you do me one. That's how it works.
tell Hook about Mary. Tell the old woman.
they'll hear you, if you make them. - I don't understand.
you will.
and when you do, " ant-solutely " delicious.
Peter. - Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, you're awake, Peter.

he's not paralysed.
Hi, baby.
the painter is back from the old Kingdom.
lt's just a little one. lt'll stop in a minute.
God, not another one.
now what?
minor shaker, Dr. Stegman.
we have them from time to time. lt will stop shortly.
you can let go now, Elmer. lt's over.
l would have said he was totally gorked.
he was.
what happened here?
ln medical terms?
a miracle.
but there's a price to be paid for the miraculous.
and Blue Cross doesn't cover it.
this is Kingdom Hospital...
where the ground is uneasy...
and old secrets have begun to rise to the surface.
please, come again.

he's bigtime. Also, he's gay.
don't start, Perry, huh?
I seen you play ball. You're tough. But you see a naked guy...
...your brain says, "I want that."
I don't make that leap. It's like, "Look, there's an elephant. Quick...
...let's drain its blood to paint my boathouse.
it's just that that's not the first thing you think of.

by now you may wonder how I wound up here, or maybe not.
maybe you wonder how Silly Putty picks shit up from comic books.
point is, I don 't see another goddamn narrator, so pipe down.
how did I get here? See for yourself.

take it easy.
Jesus. Oh, no, no. We're not ready for you yet, sir.
go wait with the others. - Grace, do me a favor, let's take him.
he's ready. You're ready? - Ready?
okay, come on.
you know the setup? Got any questions?
he's got no questions. Look at him. Let's go.
let's read.
where is he? Where's Raphael? - Where is he?
Where's...?
beat up on me all night. You want me to give up my partner, you can go spit.
quit acting like the good guy, jerk-off.
you got your partner killed.
he was in over his head, you knew it.
you may as well have pulled the trigger.
you killed him!
no, I didn't... I didn't kill him. He wanted in.
Why...?
Why?!
I didn't want him to come in on it. He insisted.
I said, "Stay at home." But he doesn't listen. He's such a stupid son of a bitch.
I killed him, didn't I?
Oh, fuck, this is my fault. I'm sorry.
sorry.
Hey, good luck.
see, this is what I'm talking about. Old school. Method.
studio. - Brando. Put this in the pouch to L. A.
get Gay Perry on the phone.
now, get this, they're screen-testing me. Is that wild?
one minute, I'm boosting Xboxes in the East Village...
...the next, I'm sipping champagne in L. A.
Hi. - Hey.
so, what do you do?
I'm retired. I invented dice when I was a kid.
how about you? - I do a little acting.
I'm gonna see who else is here.
anyway, that's how I got to the party.
now, Harmony, different story.
some will tell you she got here on account of the giant robot.
I'll show you that in a minute.
but for me, robot-schmobot, she was destined to be here.
jeez, look at those stems, will you?
not that that's what constitutes why she should be here.
Yes, racist. I'm serious.
the other reindeer laughed at him. Then, out of the blue, they need him.
he's as good as a fog light or whatever.
you know what, so you tell me, how is it any different than:
don't talk to Reggie, he's black.
Oh, wait, he can play basketball. Sign him up.
Rudolph, Reggie.
harmony Faith Lane was your typical L. A. Girl, she wasn 't from there.
she grew up in a burg in southern Indiana.
"when in doubt, cut up a pig." That was the town motto.
like most soon-to-be-fucked-up girls, Harmony was wicked smart.
of course, credit where credit's due...
...she had a terrific mentor. No, not her.
him.
go to hell, Jonny Gossamer!
she poured herself into a seamless dress.
from the looks of it, she spilled some.
Jonny spoke from the pages of cheap paperbacks...
...and told of a promised land known as "the Coast..."
...and a magical city called Los Angeles.
as the years progressed, she wished he was real.
wished that he would come to Indiana to save her little sister, Jenna.
you see, Papa was at her night after night.
but Jonny never showed.
and then the guy writing the books died.
age 16, she split.
took the bus to L. A. the promised land.
she'd get rich and famous and then help little sis.
before he died...
...the guy who wrote the books said Jonny was a joke.
he wrote it for money, and it was bullshit.
harmony ignored this. She knew better. I mean, who the hell was he?
he was just a writer.
and that's how she got to the same party as me...
Oh, shit. I skipped something.
damn it. This robot bit. I made a big deal, then I forgot.
fuck, bad narrating. Like my dad telling a joke.
"Oh, wait, back up. I forgot to tell you the cowboy rode a blue horse. " Fuck.
I don 't know if you want to see it now, but here's the fucking robot stuff.
can I say "fuck" more?
now back to Protocop, starring Jeff Neal.
what the...?
Oh, my God.
Hey!
sources close to Neal, who has not worked as an actor in two years...
...Say he seemed despondent earlier tonight...
...During a rerun of Protocop.
the actor, who still retains a costume he wore on the show...
...Allegedly dressed up...
...Stumbled down the bike path and wandered into this Venice Beach house...
...where aspiring actress Harmony Faith Lane was shocked to discover him.
I'd jog by, "Hi, hello," you know, that sort of thing.
who's this? - I feel for the guy.
this city can 't get enough of messing with people.
like putting a whoopee cushion on the seat of an electric chair.
like that. - They always do this.
you can never see below the waist. It's like a Playmate in 1964.
it was always behind the bedpost or there's a shadow. You never...
what am I telling you for? Invite her to something.
and there it was. Bingo.
destiny.
you know what, you better be her doctor.
walk away. Don't think, just do it.
what, are you her brother or something? It's none of your business, man.
I will fuck you up. - No, you'll try.
and that little experiment will end in tears, my friend.
so again, for the cheap seats, do not think, walk the fuck away.
or let's you and me go outside right now.
it's past my bedtime.
make a choice.
asshole.
you all right?
Yeah.
Thanks, bro.
one day, I'll actually learn how to fight.
Perry Van Shrike. - Hey. Harry Lockhart.
I heard about you. You're the whatchamacallit, the consultant.
you must be... Anyway... - Gay Perry?
Yeah. Right. Dabney calls you that.
I guess you guys are old buddies. - Five years.
wow, five years.
still gay? - Me? No.
I'm knee-deep in pussy. I just like the name so much, I can't get rid of it.
you should know better than to fall asleep at a party. There's freaks here.
Dabney wants you to take detective lessons.
come again? - For your acting.
I've got surveillance tomorrow. You game?
what's the person like? Crime lord?
please. I'm guessing some sad, Ionely little man...
...who single-handedly haunts his own home in the Hollywood Hills.
that was incredibly gay.
good God. Ouch. - Yeah, you should see the other guy.
Harry, this is our generous host, Harlan Dexter.
Ah, yes, of course. You're Dabney's golden boy from back East.
I hope it isn't past your bedtime.
no, sir. My mom used to say I had the neon disease.
when the neon lights came on, I woke up.
I'm afraid I'm similarly afflicted. My daughter just lived 10 years in Paris.
she says it is heaven for the vampire set.
if you'll excuse me, apparently I'm meant to help cut this monstrosity.
mom's gone, so it's just him and his born-again little bundle of joy.
born-again? That's precious. - Isn't it?
three months ago, she was suing him over mom's millions.
he called her a... Well, a bad word.
cunt. Welcome to Hollywood.
okay, I apologize.
that is a terrible scene. It's like, "Why was that in the movie?"
gee, you think maybe it'll come back later, maybe?
I hate that. A TV's on, talking about the new power plant.
wonder where the climax will happen.
or that shot of the cook in Hunt for Red October. Sorry.
Hi, thank you for coming.
Hey, do you know that blond gal who just left?
Oh, the one with the guy that beat the shit out of you? No.
Bye, have a better night.
she had something, that gal, this quality.
like the girl from high school...
...the one that got away. You know what I mean? That haunts you still.
Yeah, I had that. - You did?
Bobby Mills.
well, maybe you should try to get in touch.
I got 5 bucks says you could still get him.
Really? That's funny. I got a 10 says, "Pass the pepper.
I got two quarters harmonizing on "Moonlight in Vermont."
what? - Talking money.
a talking monkey? - Talking monkey, yeah.
came here from the future. Ugly sucker. Only says, "Ficus."
detective lessons tomorrow.
don't forget. - Okay.
and Harry...
come here.
that girl, I know her. She's done some work for me.
try the Domino Room.
Where's that?
hey there. I'm Flicka. - Hey.
how are you? - Good. So, what do you do?
I'm a private detective. And you? - I'm a stewardess.
Really? - Yeah.
well, nice to meet you. - That it?
Yeah. - Yep.
could I have a Jack and soda? Thanks.
evening. Harry.
God, I'm sore.
I mean, physically, not like a guy who's angry in a movie in the 1950s.
didn't I see you at a party hours ago? - Why?
why what? - Why me?
seriously, why not the girl over there? Look, she's very pretty.
which one?
on the left, next to Brazilian Billy Bob Thornton.
Oh, that's a bit of a reach.
I'm interrupting. I feel badly. What are you drinking?
bad. - Bad? Sorry?
you feel bad. - Bad?
"badly" is an adverb. To say you feel badly says that the mechanism...
...which allows you to feel is broken. - Well, that one over there?
between... Oh, God, nix, nix. That's...
the blond. The blond's pathetic. - Because?
for starters, she's been fucked more times than she's had hot meals.
I heard. It was neck and neck, and then she skipped lunch.
worst thing, though... - Do tell.
worst thing is she's 35 years old and still trying to act.
I see her at auditions all the time.
it's over, baby. You missed. - That's charitable of you.
may I ask how old you are?
go for it. - Okay, how old are you?
thirty-four. - Yeah?
I'm a baby. - Where's your buddy? The guy you...
the guy you left the party with? - He's a fucking asshole.
I just needed a ride. Sorry, I swear a lot.
I know. It's okay. - Did you know the host?
no. - He looked familiar, though.
probably an actor.
go away, Mr. Fly.
I was talking to your friend. - She doesn't want to talk to you.
sunshine, she'll be back to you in a minute. Relax.
she doesn't have a minute.
tell you what, if you change your mind about that drink...
...I'll be over there with Native American Joe Pesci.
you are so... - That was good, right?
why are you humoring him? Stop it.
you know what, there's an empty table over there.
I hear it's a recommended cheeseball hangout.
your mouth is a recommended place to put a sock.
princess. Scary friend.
goddamn it.
Harry Lockhart, are you gonna recognize me or what?
God! Embrey, Indiana!
loves snakes, afraid of spiders.
come on, remember? You were Amazing Harry...
no, no, no. Harold the Great. - Harmony?
you cut me in half, remember?
Oh, shit. Oh, my God. How are you?
okay, I was a bad narrator again...
...because the kid at the beginning, the magician, that was me.
I don 't want to put this on you...
...but if you've been paying attention, I shouldn 't have to...
great. No wonder. Ma and Pa Kettle. I got an idea.
why not put these two lame-o extras in front of the mammoth fucking lens?
boo. Scat. Fat lady, leave.
see there? Harold.
remember how I said this high school chick haunted me?
how seeing Harmony made me think of her?
that's because it was her. It all came flooding back.
how I was the one she confided in.
while she was doing every other guy.
it was the first time I felt that how pitying someone...
...and wanting to fuck them can get all tangled up in your head.
overwhelming sadness. Meanwhile, you got a rodney.
is that sick? I think... Yeah, I think that's sick.
leaving my sister back home, leaving her there all alone...
hardest thing I ever did.
do you remember when we were real little...
...and a movie crew came to town?
that mystery flick with the guy, Jonny what's-his-name?
gossamer. - Jonny Gossamer. Right.
your mom went nuts, and she bought all the books and stuff.
that was... God, that was forever ago. - Yeah, that was back in the day.
Harry...
...I didn't get famous.
yet.
I did...
...get to do this one commercial.
you're shitting me. Which one?
well, you know the one with the bear?
and it goes... Well, this is funny.
"I prefer Genaros, but... "- "But I'm a bear, what do I know"?
"I suck heads off fish. " That was you?
Oh, my God. - Yeah, it was. Yeah.
that's awesome. - Commercial.
come on, that's a big deal.
that's a national commercial. - Harry, stop.
it's nothing. There was actually this kind of cool moment where I got...
...to sort of do the wave.
I prefer Genaros.
whatever, it's nothing. - It's pretty cool.
it's nothing special at all. - Well, I think it's special.
punk-rock Steven Seagal thinks it's special.
right there, at your 11 o'clock.
that's dead-on, right?
that's all right. I had him pegged when I came in.
come back to the hotel for a little while, just have one drink. Bring your friend.
it'd just be a drink. You'll be home faster than you can say "Jack Robinson."
I don't know about that. I can say...
..."Jack Robinson" pretty fast. - I'm timing you.
Jack Robinson.
do you have any idea what time it is? - I'm really sorry.
God, you still look great. You're just stunning. I like...
why are you here? - Good question.
sounds crazy, but I don't remember what occurred...
...Between the hours of 2 and 5, a blur.
Really? Where's Marleah? - Marleah?
the girl you... - Marleah fell asleep at my place...
...and I didn't see you leave...
I left when you had your tongue down her throat.
I did? - Yeah.
God. No, wrong throat, wrong woman. That's bad.
Yeah, that's bad. You got 10 seconds, Harry.
Oh, boy, pressure, pressure. I came here...
...because I think you're intelligent and attractive...
that's plenty. Stop. Oh, my God! I can't believe you'd come here...
...to tell me you like me after you fucked my friend!
that's just it, I didn't. I believe that I did not.
what? You said you don't remember!
if I don't remember because I was drunk, how could I have gotten it up?
I know this is outrageous and not normal.
I'm not pretending that I'm normal. I just chickened out...
moron. Why? Why? Why?
and the plots, they all have this thing, this formula that was so cool.
seriously, I would go through one in a day.
a whole book in one day. Wow. - See, Gossamer would always take on...
...Two cases that were seemingly unrelated.
one's normal and the other's some wild shit...
...then you'd find out that they're connected.
that it's all one case.
that's the essence of the...
Yeah, I get that all the time. Would you mind not rooting around in there?
it's tiny. Is this real?
Yeah, it's a derringer. It's loaded.
I call it my faggot gun. - Because?
it's only good for a couple shots, then you gotta drop it for something better.
you asked, chief.
on with our lesson.
my client is one Allison Ames. A-M-E-S. - Ames.
female. She hired me to do some video surveillance.
is she a looker? - Oh, man.
she opens the door, she got nothing on but the radio.
invites me to sit down, sits on my lap...
...fires up a smoke. - Really?
no. Idiot.
she hired me over the phone.
paid for it with a credit card. - Okay.
rule number one: This business, real life, it's boring.
do you have to smoke? - You want me to put it out?
Yeah, soon as you find a large, brown clump of shrubs, just throw it in there.
so you knew Harmony in high school. You said she dissed you.
no, not really. She fucked every other guy but me.
no, that's not true. She made one concession.
she agreed not to fuck my best friend, Chook Chutney.
he was my best friend, so she gave me that.
well, that was nice of her. - Even if he asked, she said she wouldn't.
stay put. Be quiet.
"Chook Chutney"? Yeah, he's gay.
what's wrong with his car? - Do I look like a mechanic?
are we gonna follow him? - Where'd he go?
he was right in front of us, then he cut in... Where is he?
what the hell. He's gotta be somewhere. He turned right in front of us.
Jesus! - Shit!
Harry, come back.
Harry.
there's no one in the car. Harry. - What?
Harry, stop.
I think it's going down. - Wait, the sound.
check the back seat. - No, get the keys!
the keys! Get the keys!
Perry.
Perry?
shit.
Perry!
Where'd she come from?
she was in the trunk. I had to shoot the lock to get it open.
Oh, Jesus.
God, what did they do to her face?
is she dead? - No. She's resting her eyes for a minute.
of course she's fucking dead. Her neck's broken.
Hey, what the hell's going on? - Shut up.
Hey, we got a dead girl here! - Hey, shut up.
two guys in masks, and there they go.
what the fuck is going on? This is bad.
we gotta roll before the cops come.
nix. We go right to the cops. - Exactly, to the cops...
...Who'll believe that she broke her neck before you shot her in the head.
what?
come on, we gotta go. - Oh, God.
we gotta go. Go, go, go. - Oh, God.
Oh, God.
all right, we're out of here. - We gotta go, go, go.
Where's my gun?
no, l... - Give me my gun.
I got rid of it. - Say again.
threw it in the lake. You wouldn't, I would.
I got priors in New York, so I can't be messing around...
you threw it away? - It's evidence.
watch it. Relax. - Okay, okay. No, I'm sorry.
I got a little nonplussed there. - This is crazy. I understand.
what is that? Is that a clue? - What do you mean?
do you see that? - In the thing?
what were you thinking?
my $2000 ceramic Vektor my mother got me as a special gift...
...you threw next to the car. What happens when they drag the lake?
you think they'll find my pistol?
Jesus. Look up "idiot" in the dictionary. You know what you'll find?
a picture of me? - No...
...the definition of the word "idiot," which you fucking are.
bitch client.
hires me, has me witness a murder.
can I use a dry towel? This towel's wet. - No.
this towel is wet. - The towel is for the seat.
this was for your shoes. You handed it to me for my face?
this is wet. Can I use a dry...? - It's dirty. No.
can l...? - No. Stop dripping.
shit better be improving your acting.
get out. - Sorry about the gun.
whatever. Out.
go. Sleep badly.
any questions, hesitate to call.
bad. - Excuse me?
sleep bad.
otherwise, it seems like the mechanism that allows sleep...
what, fuckhead? "Badly" is an adverb. Who taught you grammar? Out. Vanish.
I'll give you a buzz. - Die.
that's all right, don't apologize.
blow me. You forgot this. - Oh, thanks.
Hello? - I'm trying to locate Harry Lockhart.
speaking. - I'm detective Sgt. Kale.
mind answering a question or two?
of course, no problem. Fire away, officer.
are you familiar with a woman by the name of Harmony Faith Lane?
Yeah, what's this...?
are you aware of giving your number to Miss Lane recently?
on a slip of paper, perhaps? - No.
are you sure? - Well, maybe she had my number. Why?
we're required by law to treat every suicide as a potential homicide.
harmony Lane shot herself, sir.
suicide? - Yes...
Hello?
Hello?
I'll be goddamned. - Jesus.
don't blame yourself. Listen...
...Sometimes these things just happen... - For a reason.
for a reason? Fuck that.
Why? Because I fall off a building, 10 people in Baltimore...
...Survive a bus crash?
swell, they're enjoying Baltimore. I'm lying here with my brains out.
I've been to Baltimore, you win.
listen...
...I'm really sorry. I gotta go. - Yeah.
I gotta go.
I have to go.
Genaros. Pure drinking pleasure.
I prefer Genaros. But what do I know? I'm a bear.
I suck the heads off fish.
Genaros.
I was tired. I was pissed. I was wetter than Drew Barrymore at a grunge club.
I needed a hot bath, a warm bed.
but the night had other plans for me.
Oh, you did? - I got the Cyber Agent.
you got the Cyber Agent. - It has all the cool weapons.
you got Protocop coming too.
it's gonna be worth more too because I think he's, like, paralyzed now.
son of a bitch!
see, I forgot, old Jonny, he always had two cases. Remember?
how are you?
Hey.
she's gone, Harry.
Yeah. - She's gone.
I know. Who?
fact is, she stole not only your credit card, but your ID.
we're very sorry about the mix-up on our part.
so are you willing to positively identify this woman as your...
my sister! Yes! - Your sister was here?
Oh, God! God, we haven't spoken in years.
she's never forgiven me for leaving her all alone.
I'm just gonna get you a blanket. - I don't want a blanket!
but you're shivering. - I don't care!
you're freaking me out. Will you relax, okay?
Oh, God. - I'm so glad that you're okay...
...but now, I don't know, you're making me more nervous. Sit down.
okay. - Tell me what happened.
yesterday, Jenna, she got into my house, Harry.
she must have been broke, I don't know.
she swiped 200 bucks, a credit card, California ID, God knows what else.
right. - Oh, God.
no more lies, Harry. - No.
no.
are you a detective?
are you a detective? - Who told you that?
Flicka. Flicka. You know, my friend? She told me.
she told me you were a detective.
lf you are, then I really need your help. - Well...
that's empty, honey.
okay, I know this sounds crazy, Harry, but listen. Okay. Okay.
my sister's been living out here... - Harmony's sister, dead. What the hell?
what was she even doing here? The lady in the lake, now the sister.
this was two corpses in three hours. Am I crazy? That's unusual, right?
Yeah, looking back, I maybe should've told her...
...I wasn 't really a nipple... Detective.
detective. Sorry. I should've said something, but she wouldn 't shut up.
the card she stole from me was maxed out.
right before she died, she charged over $2000 on it. That's weird, isn't it?
Sentron something. Some bullshit company! Plus...
red flag, Harry. She took her birth control pill for the day.
why would she even bother with the pill, huh?
she was murdered, Harry. She was murdered. She was murdered.
honey, all right. Relax, relax, relax. Okay, relax.
are you gonna help me, Harry?
I gotta check my schedule... - lf you're not gonna help me...
...I need to get out of here, find someone that'll help me.
I just gotta check my schedule. - Can you help me?
if you're not gonna help me, I need to find somebody else!
my caseload is pretty... - Oh, Harry, thank you.
yuck, come on.
it was nothing. I didn't do anything. - What are you doing?
I didn't do anything. - You were grabbing my tit.
no, there was a spider. There was a big spider.
Oh, please, whatever. - I swear to God.
look, I'll find it. I'll find the thing. Where are you? Fuzzy little bitch.
whatever. It's okay, I believe you. - Clearly, you don't.
look, Harry, you grabbed my tit. It's life, all right? It's no biggie.
no biggie? Guy grabs your tit, "That's life, no biggie"?
I mean, what kind of talk is that?
no, you tell me. What kind of talk is that? I can't believe you.
I can't believe that that's the reaction that...
see there?
Yeah.
I trust you. - Right.
what is your problem? I'm letting you off the hook. You didn't do anything.
no, but you thought I did.
do you get it? I'm on the hook. The hook is my home. Do you understand?
listen to me. I grab your tit, it's a fucking biggie!
that came out wrong. But what I'm saying is...
...you act like, "Oops, it's an okay lapse. You know, everybody does it."
what the fuck kind of guys you hang out with here?
I mean, are you the kind of girl who like, you know...?
who what, Harry?
who what?
forget it.
I'm sorry, just relax. Just get some rest, okay?
okay, we'll start on your case tomorrow. All right?
afternoon good? - Whatever, Harry.
I'm going. - Okay.
I'm taking some sweats, all right? - Yeah, anything you want to borrow.
I'll give them back. - Yeah. Yeah, anything in the drawer.
if it's in the drawer, it's clean.
night, Harry.
Harry?
this is...
this is really great. - Isn't it?
I'm leaving. - Yeah, some nice rest.
Bye.
fuck off...!
say again? They gave her back?
Yes. She's in my shower. I'm looking at her, for chrissake.
that's impossible. They don 't even know you.
you're right. The body can't be here. This is all a dream. There's Elmo the elf.
shut up. How did they get in? - I don't know.
how am I supposed to know? Fire escape, maybe.
okay, first things first. We gotta move her somewhere. You got gloves?
excuse me? - Gloves. Do you have gloves?
you have to move her. If it's a frame-up, some asshole's calling the cops on you.
do this: Wrap up the body in a blanket, a sheet, anything.
okay, any particular kind of gloves? - Yes, fawn.
will you fucking hurry?
Perry? - Yeah?
I peed on it. - What? You peed on what?
I peed on the corpse. Can they do, like, an ID from that?
I'm sorry, you peed on...? - On the corpse. My question is...
no, my question. I get to go first.
why in poo-perfect hell would you pee on a corpse?
it's not like I did it for kicks.
you said this doesn't happen. This is your fault!
shut up and listen. First, we have to wrap the body.
second, you've got to find the gun.
say this with me, "Find the gun." - Find the gun.
damn it, I threw it in the lake.
not my gun, idiot. They dropped the body on you, it's a frame-up.
then they also have planted a gun, trust me. Move it.
I'll be there in four minutes.
caller specified room 714, some sort of brawl or something. Violent.
Yeah, 714. Lockhart.
let me get you the key. - Actually, it's not 714, it's 514.
I was just up there, and it's really noisy.
let's get the key. - Yep, pretty awful.
don't answer that. - Yeah, duh.
that it? - No, that's the corpse...
...from the last guy who stayed here.
fuck off. Was there a gun?
Yeah, it's right here. Perry, sons of bitches made us, made me.
I'm in town for two days, they know who I am and where to find me.
that's impossible. - Yeah, it's totally nuts. Back stairway.
I forgot to tell you, Harmony's alive. She thinks her sister was murdered.
come again? - Never mind.
see, these dudes tonight, they see two assholes out of nowhere.
what do they think? - They think we know something.
they panic. They got a body, they've gotta dispose of the evidence.
in my shower? Come on, you said real life.
they were setting you up, dummy. - They're not setting me up. Shut up.
you change your tune every five minutes.
kiss me. - What? No, no, no.
check out Doris and Lucinda over here.
these lessons suck.
I quit. This is not being a detective. Corpses floating in lakes...
...people kissing people. This is wrong. This is every shade of wrong.
somebody wanna fill me in?
she thinks I'm a detective, so go along with it.
what? - Don't fuck me up.
Hey.
do you know the cops are looking for you, Harry?
they are? - Yeah.
I sent them to the wrong room. I didn't know what else to do.
you did fine. Perry and I, we're just...
Hiya, Perry. - We're just running, you know, a game.
Perry, what do you call it?
the old Bring Them In and Push Them Out. That's what we're doing.
what's going on?
why are you and Perry nacking on each other?
I sent her home believing, A, we'd meet tomorrow to go over her case...
...and, B, I wasn 't actually gay.
do not ask me how I did B.
why didn't we just leave it there?
think, dummy. A 911 call from your hotel room...
...all of a sudden, there's a corpse outside? Bad idea.
speaking of bad ideas, what's this about you taking on your own case?
of all the dipshit things to do.
killed herself, by the way.
killed herself. I solved your case for you.
harmony's convinced... - I don't care about... Listen to me.
little sis punched her own ticket. - Okay. Gotcha.
all right, this looks good up ahead. Time to lose the luggage.
sorry, sweetheart.
you deserved better.
before I left, I got her into foster care.
I've never told you just how awful he treated her. My dad, I'm talking about.
I'll tell you what, I take notes, in general...
...so if you're just real specific, thorough and precise, that'll help.
I remember only lying to her one time.
I said to her:
maybe the man who is living here is not your father.
you told your sister she was adopted, yeah?
no, I did one better.
I told her her real father was an actor...
...who was in the movie that came through town.
Jonny Gossamer... - Jonny Gossamer movie. That's right.
I told Jenna one day she'd go to Hollywood...
...and she'd meet her famous, real father.
she believed me, Harry, and she came out here looking for him.
okay, this is a bunch. I can start my...
...process, I guess. - Thank you.
I'm on the case. Here is my card.
it's a magic card, so... - Wow, "the Amazing Harold."
just say "abracadabra." - What happened, somebody sue you?
it used to be "alakazam" when you cut me in half.
and, not to be picky, but it was "Harold the Great."
no, I used to be great, now I'm amazing. Get with it.
Hi, it's me. You hear anything?
no, there's nothing in the papers, so...
I'm busy working on Harmony's case.
what case? Leave her alone.
news on Channel 5, just starting. Call me after.
a kidnapping gone wrong. It is unclear why his daughter...
...was subsequently murdered or where...
...for she was almost certainly killed and then moved, police sources say.
Veronica Dexter was reported missing yesterday afternoon...
...when she failed to greet her boyfriend at the airport.
miss Dexter recently made headlines when she returned from Paris...
...and withdrew her multimillion-dollar lawsuit against her father...
...Actor-turned-entrepreneur Harlan Dexter.
Mr. Dexter owns the prestigious Dexter Clinic.
his wife died last spring, prompting Veronica 's return to the U. S...
...and a father-daughter reconciliation following years of estrangement.
Veronica Dexter, 25 years old yesterday. Paul.
we were just at that party. Are you telling me...
...that the girl in the lake, that was Veronica Dexter?
positive ID, scars, dental records.
you talked to your police guy? - Yeah, not much there.
the lab report came back, no sign of rape.
boils down to this:
Veronica Dexter, yesterday afternoon about 4: 30, left her home.
went off to the airport, pick up some dude, old boyfriend. Off she went.
that was the last anybody saw of her? - With a symmetrical, ungooshed head.
police ever find the car?
no, genius, that was us. Remember?
Oh, yeah, right.
the killers were at the party, Harry. - They were?
the killers were at Dexter's? - That's how they recognized you.
it's getting too scary. You gotta bail. Get a flight out, today.
but I got my screen test Tuesday. I'll go Wednesday.
you're not getting the part. - Fuck off. Don't be a schmuck.
I know it's a long shot. - You're not gonna get the part.
you're not listening to me. You won't get the... Harry!
you're not gonna get the part, okay? Colin Farrell wants too much money.
do you get me now?
Dabney, he unearths a discovery. New kid, works for cheap.
flies him out here, high profile, parties...
...Screen tests, detective lessons, all of it.
you were just being used.
shave a couple million off of Colin Farrell's price tag.
sorry, chief. There it is.
I'm not gonna lie to you anymore.
I understand if you wanna take a swing at me. You fuck!
you sissy bitch!
stop.
don't bother asking Harmony out on your date.
she wasn't very happy to find out that you're not a detective, that you lied.
you told her? - Pick those up.
pick them up.
why did you tell her? You didn't have to tell her.
I am an idiot. I thought we were friends. - We're not friends.
I was in trouble, you were there for me. - No, I was... Stop speaking.
I was there protecting my employer, Dabney. Hello.
he pays me to insulate him from corpses.
I'm not a nice man, Harry.
go home before something bad happens to you.
what, are you threatening me? - No, moron.
go home before the bad guys do something bad to you.
right, I get it. Fine.
merry Christmas. Sorry I fucked you over.
no problem. Don't quit your gay job.
arriving passengers from flight number 758 from Denver...
...May retrieve their baggage at carousel two.
Hey, Flicka. Hey, it's me, Harry.
remember me? What's up, honey? How are you?
she doesn't want to talk to you. - Oh, no, no. I know.
did you ever think maybe I don't want to talk to her?
I just saw your really distinctive ears.
you look different, but it's obviously Flicka.
maybe it's you I'm interested in. - Is that true?
not really. Look, she must have a cell phone, right? She must.
forget it. This is between you two. - Look, I got a ticket. I am leaving.
I'm going back to the East Coast, and that's...
no? Come on, I just want to say something to her.
just anything before I split. I'm begging you. Come on, help me out.
I'm gonna regret this. - No, you're not...
...and that is a very smart suit, by the way.
it's not here, that's funny. - What's funny?
nothing. It's just under her stage name.
Oh, God. Everyone's got a stage name. What's her stage name?
Ames. Allison Ames.
okay, well, I'll just write it down and then...
Hey! Say that name again.
Allison Ames. - Allison Ames. A-M-E-S.
that's her stage name. - I just said that.
that's the name on her credit cards.
how am I supposed to know? - Fuck! Thanks, honey. Gotta roll.
later.
you have reached the offices of Sentron, Inc. Leave a message.
newsflash, Perry. Your client, Ames, it was the little sister.
repeat, the little sister.
that's where Harmony's 2 grand went.
it's in your bank, you overpriced bastard.
her kid sister hired you.
do you get this? Your case and my case are the same fucking case.
come on! - Get out of my life!
I'm at the airport, right, and I run into Flicka, and she says...
did I just cut off your finger? - Yeah.
it's on the floor, to my periph... I don't wanna see it. Pick it up, put it on ice.
Thanks.
you're a genius, Harry. You're a genius.
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry I had to bail on you, but I had to go to work.
I am going nuts here. I can 't stop thinking about this.
what's my sister's connection to Veronica Dexter?
she predicted that murder, Harry. She sent you and Perry to that exact spot.
that whole thing is wild. You know what else is nuts? You cut off my finger!
Oh, God, Harry, I am so sorry about that. How is it?
it's fine. It's all shut up. They gave me painkillers.
Where's Perry? We gotta find him. - Perry's coming by here.
I'm working a party on Sunset Plaza.
remember you said the killer may have been at Dexter's party?
well, that whole bunch is here tonight. - Honey, put me on the list, I'll drop by.
I'll see if I can stir up the kettle, stick out my hat, see if anyone shoots at it.
maybe you could put the hat in the kettle...
...and if they shoot at it, it'll ricochet. Harry, you sound trashed.
give me the address. I'm coming.
I showed up mildly whacked on Demerol...
...Thinking Harmony's theory wasn 't so crazy.
Hi.
what if little sis had been murdered by the same assholes...
...who offed Veronica Dexter?
remember? With the ski masks, those dudes.
then and there, I made a decision.
if it fucking killed me, I would not stop...
...until I got, like, two more Demerol.
no, seriously, I was on the case. Harry Lockhart, L. A.P. I.
I got it. - What do you got?
just now. My friend Tiff does the video dubbing at Fox.
lord of the Cock Rings. - No, Harry, it's a fake label.
copyright infringement, she'd get fired. It's a Jonny Gossamer movie.
if Jenna was hunting her mystery dad, this is where she would start, right?
Jesus, don't patronize me! - I'm not.
you're patronizing me. - No, I'm not. It's just a funny little buzz.
I don't know if this guy's your boyfriend or not...
...but when you were in the bathroom, he was checking me out.
what? What is it out here with these women?
please, they're no different from anywhere else.
they are. These are damaged goods, every one of them, from way back.
take a guy who sleeps with 100 women a year, go into his childhood...
...Dollars to doughnuts, it's relatively unspectacular.
now, you take one of these gals who sleeps with 100 guys a year...
...and I bet you if you look in their childhood...
...There's something rotten in Denver.
denmark. - That too. But it's abandonment...
...It's abuse. It's, "My uncle put his ping-ping in my papa."
then they all come out here.
it's like someone took America by the East Coast and shook it...
...and all the normal girls managed to hang on.
okay, everybody who hates Harry here raise their hand.
see that? Obedient little bitches too. - Fuck you!
Hey.
okay, you've got 30 of my fucking seconds, thrill me.
all right, guys, cast list.
catch. That's the credit card my sister used to hire you.
so who's in this cinematic milestone?
we got a Michael Beck, whoever that is. - He's the star of Xanadu, with...
...Olivia Newton-John and Gene Kelly. - Gay.
what? - Nothing.
Perry, listen up. I know this is a long shot, but indulge me, please.
we gotta lose the hat. I'm sorry, honey, I can't...
God, I'm working! - I know, but just forget it.
seriously, don't jump all over me. Just pay attention. Watch it, please.
that's Harlan Dexter. - What?
who's Har...? What? - Look, that's...
he's 20 years younger, but that's Harlan Dexter.
always sees the inside of a police van.
no way.
this kind of makes sense. He had the Gossamer books at his house.
used to be an actor.
I remember him now. 1980. Oh, my God, I saw him like this.
young. - Where?
in Indiana. He was there with the movie crew.
remember, I told you he looked familiar. Oh, God, this can't be true.
and your sister has to have seen this, so you know what it comes down to.
you tell your sister a fairy tale about her real father...
and 20 years later, she comes out to L. A. Hunting Harlan Dexter.
I've got a surveillance in MacArthur Park.
I gotta follow some chick around till midnight. Do not play detective.
this is not a book. This is not a movie.
we got it. Do you think I'm stupid?
you wouldn't know where to feed yourself...
...if you didn't flap your mouth so much. Yes, I think you're stupid.
Harry, don't listen to a word he says, all right? We're getting somewhere.
I'll call you tomorrow. I'm going back to work.
good.
excuse me. - What's up, baby? How you feeling?
I'm just gonna... - Come and take a walk. Walk with me.
great, this is fucking rich.
well, now, here we all are:
Ike, Mike and Mustard. - What the hell does that mean?
I'm with him on this one. That's pretty fucking obscure.
I hear that all the time. - You do?
Yeah, sure. - Where? At the 1942 Club?
just because you didn't get it... - Motherfucker, I could... Slow your roll.
this is bullshit. What will you do, take me out here? There's sec...
keep talking. Keep talking. - You wanna know who we are?
I'm the frying pan, see? And my boy over here...
he's Mustard. I'm Mustard, baby.
sure. - He's the fire.
fuck you, Mr. Mustard. - Here we go.
now, me and my man, we're puzzled lately by your behavior, such as...
such as why is a savvy, stand-up cat like yourself consorting with gay men?
frolicking in the lake together. What is that?
you're the guys who were wearing the masks.
you don't ask the questions. - Don't ask questions.
God, you just tore up my fucking finger! I just got this fixed. Jesus!
I bet there's a doctor in New York, clear that shit right up.
clear it right up.
l. A. Don't want you no more, tough guy.
all right?
how much further to the hospital? - Five minutes away.
talk to me. Our mascot, back in high school, who was it?
come on, Harry, stay with me.
whitey, the white knight. Whitey.
I guess it's better than calling him "Knighty."
then it'd be Knighty Knight. Soon it'd be Toodles, and then Ta-Ta.
it's very emasculating. - Harry, that's them. Twelve o'clock.
you said it's a black guy and a white guy?
you're right. Get the plate, call the cops.
let me find a pen. - No. Whatever. Watch the road.
are we slowing down?
no, I'm getting a pen. - Are you following them? Better not be.
tell me you're not following them. - I'm taking you to the hospital.
Oh, shit. They're turning. - What?
holy shit.
perry's stakeout. It's a setup. They're going to MacArthur Park after Perry!
wait a second! My finger's hanging off. We gotta move on this.
we're gonna go save Perry, really quickly.
then we'll go fix your finger.
it'll be like, "Hey, Perry, look out." Boom, back in the car. All right?
cool? - Yeah. This is exhausting.
bingo. All right. All right, Harry.
twelve o'clock, that's them. One of them is on foot.
God, Harry. Shit, if I leave the keys, can you take yourself to the hospital?
Oh, yeah, sure. - All right, good.
I got the gun you gave me. - You what?
Perry!
now, where you going?
no, no, no. Don't fight it.
let it happen, baby.
Perry!
Perry, watch out! Goddamn it, turn around!
son of a bitch!
how about that, you fucking animals! Goddamn cocksuckers.
Perry. - Where the hell did you come from?
he got away. - It's okay. You did good.
I couldn't shoot him, Perry. Oh, God. - You did fine. You did fine.
we gotta go now.
Hello?
anyone home?
Hello?
anyone home? I got an injury problem. Hello.
all right, first things first. You've gotta ditch that car.
I know, I know. I've...
I know you said that there was gonna be consequences, but fuck.
I saw him shot to death.
I was scared. - Look, it's okay, yeah.
we can absolutely talk about it, all right?
thank you. Thank you so much.
it's nothing against your boss. I'm grateful. I just...
I spoke to him.
you'll never have to go through anything like that again.
I swear.
promise?
Yep.
who are you?
who are you?
who...?
well, hey.
so you still here, huh, tough guy?
Oh, you got a gun, I see.
well, damn, you are tough.
sorry.
fuck.
Hey. Hey!
sit.
yeah? What? - Where the hell are you?
I'm with one of the kidnappers. One of them, anyhow. I shot him. He's dead.
come here, you fuck.
wipe the place clean and get out of there.
I want to, but I can't.
so do it. - My fingerprint's here. The dog's got it.
no one's gonna dust the fucking dog. - He's got the finger, asshole...
...with the print part. - Get the finger, kill the dog, get out.
hang on.
shit. Well, I think...
I think we're safe.
Harry?
Harry? - Hey, Perry, I shot a guy.
I never did that before.
Harry, listen...
link to the items found in the Silver Lake home...
...to the kidnap-murder of socialite Veronica Dexter.
police theorize a falling out between the kidnappers...
...Resulting in at least two deaths, and possibly a third tonight.
so this evening, was it Jonny Gossamer enough for you?
to tell you the truth, Jonny Gossamer always has a way bigger ending.
there's always the part where the guy gets tortured.
Yeah, tortured, sure. Then he usually breaks free and shoots, like, 16 guys.
Yeah, 16 guys. It's always 16. That's funny.
so this thing, it's over, right? They say the kidnappers are all dead, so...
well, Harry, I'd be lying to you if I didn't say that I still didn't have a few questions.
harmony's sister.
if she stumbles on a murder plot, why hire me to film it?
why not simply go to the police? - Right. And I still think...
...this Veronica Dexter father-daughter business is wanky.
so the whole reconcilement thing?
"reconciliation," idiot.
she comes back to the States, drops the lawsuit, moves in with her father.
suddenly they're inseparable? - So, what are you saying?
we're gonna, like, probe deeper?
absolutely not. - What?
what are you talking about? My sister paid you.
what, you're gonna bail? - Harmony...
...do you want your sister's money back? Done.
in the meantime, back off.
before you get me and Harry killed.
pardon me.
Hey, I lucked out. They gave me the same room.
lucky you. - It's pretty good. You wanna come up?
no, I don't wanna come up. Why would I go up there?
they cleaned it. - The car is coming. I'm going. Jesus.
you know what, Harry? Stop.
why'd you lie to me?
it was an excuse to stay around you. So I think, in the realm of lies...
you are such a dumb-ass.
I am so not who you think I am, Harry. - And who would that be?
you think I'm... You think I'm amazing.
you do. You think I'm so amazing...
...because that's who I told you I'd be.
Yeah, that was the game plan.
you know what? It worked. - No one else thinks so.
my opinion doesn't count? - No, it doesn't.
because you're new here.
look around, there's younger and better.
I don't want younger and better, I want you.
I'm such a moron. I'm sorry. You know what...
it doesn't matter, I'm going. Look, just... - I'm such an idiot.
I steal shit.
come again? - That's what I do for a living.
I steal audio-visual components.
I steal. I robbed a house. I stole this watch.
it's a cool watch. It's got this little light thing. I stole this gum...
...from the lobby, because it was kind of a rush.
I've never finished anything that I've started my entire life.
not school, not marriage, nothing.
and I have this thing where, like halfway in the middle, I just...
...and I cut and run.
like the other night when you were all over me...
...and you gave up and just went for it with...
prime example. I switched to the ugly friend. Homely friend. She's not ugly.
she's homely.
don't go. Please.
not yet.
this isn't finished.
turn around. - Why?
just turn around. - What, my tag's out?
this dump have a bar? - Yeah.
call me "Slick" from here on out. - That was such a good job.
you snagged a ton of gum.
I mean, petty theft... - Oh, Harry.
I really didn't need that last shot of tequila.
Oh, God.
I just had a weird thought.
Veronica Dexter. I saw the body up close. Hell, I carried the damn thing.
both times, the dress was soaked through, so it was transparent. So...
God, Harry, where are you going with this?
no, no, no. It's just...
Perry said this chick was deep into the born-again bit...
...so it's probably nothing, but just if she had on underwear...
...I didn't see any.
I guess I'm taking the couch. - Yeah. Thanks.
or you can sleep here. But it would only be sleeping, Harry.
if that's gonna frustrate you.
let's see.
Oh, Harry.
so long ago.
didn't really turn out the way we hoped, did it?
I guess if I racked my brain, I could think of worse places to be.
is that so, Whitey? - Whitey?
calling me a knight? - Maybe, yeah.
except for the boner. That's not too knightly.
the hell it isn't. Actually, it's nightly and most mornings.
fuck it, I'm not a knight. I'm sorry.
I'm thinking... I'm going nuts, so I think maybe...
...the couch is good. - What? Stop. Harry.
or I can keep drinking until it goes away.
Harry, seriously, if you're at all uncomfortable...
...I am more than happy to do something.
for chrissake, no. - Why not?
I don't want you to offer it as... Not, It's a courtesy freebie.
you're so anal. - I don't want the backup:
"let me just give you a hand here..."
...as a kind of, like, default backup thing.
you're gonna stop calling me.
no. You know, that's crazy.
I swear to God, this is it.
you are the dream girl. You always have been.
this is destiny.
okay.
before we do this...
...I have a little confession to make.
my best friend! You said you were going to drop by his house, wave goodbye.
I was leaving for L. A. I was never gonna see him...
he looked sad. - He looked sad?
Yes, he did. - You slept with Chook Chutney.
fuck. For chrissake, Harry, it was forever ago.
come on, I was a different person back then.
you slept with Chook. Excuse me. - Come on.
watch your hand. - Harry!
Yeah. - Harry, was she raped?
the Dexter girl, was she raped?
no, the ME's report showed no indication of rape stuff.
you slept with Chook Chutney.
wake up. Harry, wake up.
get up. - What's up?
harmony's in trouble. Get dressed.
let's go.
Perry, it's me. Listen, this Veronica Dexter business stinks.
I'm gonna go check on something Harry said.
call me. If I'm right, you'll shit.
what did you say to her? - Nothing.
I don't get what's happening. - She solved this thing.
that sly little minx of yours has solved this case, and now I can't find her.
you're worried. - You're not worried?
of course. If you are, I should be.
now, what did you say? Think.
you said something about the case. - Yeah. Yeah.
what?
I tell him about destiny. He's shaking his head.
about dream girls, he doesn 't care. I mention the underwear thing...
...he has a fucking conniption.
and you? How about it, filmgoer?
have you solved the case of the dead people in L. A?
times Square audiences, don 't shout at the screen.
and stop picking at that, it'll just get worse.
this won't take a second. - Right.
Hi. How are you doing tonight?
they gave away my crickets.
excuse me, you wouldn't, by chance, happen to have seen this woman?
no. I don't like him. Kurt Cobain, he took my cricket.
of course. That's sad.
ma'am, I hope you won't be offended when I ask you...
...if you're wearing anything at all underneath your hospital blues.
any undergarments. It's important.
that's the clue. Veronica Dexter was a patient here.
private mental clinic, where even nice girls don't wear undies.
how could she be here and meanwhile, she's out having parties?
think. First she hates her dad, then loves him. Has a lawsuit, withdraws it. Why?
I'll tell you why. - Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. So it's two different girls, right?
he stashed his daughter in here, and then he put the ringer on the street.
he needs someone who looks like her to withdraw the complaint.
it's been 10 years. - This is nuts.
it's right out of a Gossamer book. - Of course...
...because the guy who planned the crimes has all the books.
he's read them all. They're in his house. Plus, he was in that piece of shit...
...Movie.
you're telling me the girl imposter...
a desperate man needs a replacement daughter.
along comes a girl, Harmony's sister.
fresh off the bus, looking for her dad. - I'd say I found my imposter.
let's get out of here.
so where did she go from here? - Shut up, I'm thinking.
by the way, this thing:
single gayest thing you've ever done.
evening, gentlemen. - Hi, we are so incredibly lost.
Mr. Van Shrike, hello.
you look chilly. Come back inside.
I'm from back East. I'm kind of digging the cold.
fuck! He's the one who said it. - Or I can kill you here.
Harry, I was thinking some more about this reality versus fiction.
like in the movies, when a guy sticks a gun at some schmuck's back and says:
let's take a walk. He's got a hostage. - I've seen that movie.
in reality, the pros like about five feet of separation.
that's so the schmuck doesn't take the gun back and make him eat it.
doesn't that suck? I just hit you for no reason.
watch it.
tell us where Harmony is. - Fuck you, mary.
you don't get it, do you? This isn't "good cop, bad cop."
this is fag and New Yorker. You're in a lot of trouble.
for chrissake, who are you protecting? It's all over. Dexter is going down.
down. - I know about Veronica's lawsuit.
I know Dexter was facing ruin. I even know he switched daughters.
which, for God's sake, actually did work for a while, till last week.
then he had to kill her, huh? - Put a sock in it.
I'm asking a question. - If you ask questions...
...then it seems like we don't know anything. Okay?
and for the record, it was the boyfriend, the guy from Paris.
he would've spotted the fake and said, "That's not Veronica." Am I right?
fuck you! - Exactly.
so Dexter had Veronica killed, threw a dress on her...
...Dumped the body and walked away clean, except for one little thing.
underpants. - One tiny little pair of undies.
Yeah.
you think that's funny, huh? I'm gonna break your nose now.
I want you to picture a bullet inside your head. Can you do that for me?
fuck you.
anyway, that's ambiguous. - Ambiguous? I don't think so.
he means when you say, "Picture it inside your head..."
...is that "a bullet will be inside your head..."
...or "picture it in your head"? - Harry, will you shut up.
I don't know anything about a girl, seriously. I was bluffing.
I think that you are bluffing right now. - Harry, what are you doing?
what I'm doing for the guy who likes to bluff...
...is I'm playing a little game called "Am I Bluffing?" Where is she?
where the fuck is Harmony? You want to play hardball?
where is the girl?
what did you just do?
I just put in one bullet, didn't I? - You put a live round in that gun?
Yeah, there was like an 8 percent chance.
eight? Who taught you math? - Maybe it was more. I don't know...
shit!
Hello? - Perry, is that you?
Hey, it's me. - Hi, Harmony.
what's going on? - Where are you?
at home. - You're at home?
I just got back. I was in the Hills all day. Shitty reception.
you don't sound so good. - Why aren't you following your lead?
Oh, forget it. It's just crazy.
no, it's not crazy. Listen...
it's right out of a Gossamer book. - Don't talk. Listen.
eight percent. - And you, stop multiplying.
no, not you. Listen, call downtown...
...see if Veronica Dexter's body has gone to the mortuary.
if it has, see if there's a cremation scheduled.
wait, Perry. - Call me back right away.
look, he was gonna kill you anyway. He said so.
cover him up. I'll get the car.
all right, that's pretty much all done. - Harry...
I got an idea. I say we take the son of a bitch Dexter down.
to the racetrack and buy the son of a gun a drink.
what do you say, Perry? Oh, fuck, no fair. No fucking fair.
aurelio, give Mr. Van Shrike a little pat down.
fucking maricon.
toss it here. Let's see who it is.
we're in trouble. Dexter's got us.
he just asked a carpet-cleaning service to save him.
sorry, kid. Good hands, though.
Thanks. Used to be a magician.
and for 39. 99 we'll carpet up to three rooms in half the time.
that's a $40 value. Act today.
that chick in the casket, she won't even match up with that...
...Ringer you been toting around. You ever think about that?
he did, Harry. That's why he's cremating the body.
Yeah, you ready?
speak of the devil. Gotta go.
Perry, nice to have known you.
Harry. - Harry. Yes, of course.
Harry from New York.
I hope you don't judge Los Angeles based solely on your experience tonight.
I'm kind of scared here, Perry.
aurelio, why don't you give the kid a break?
do unto others and all that. It's Christmas.
who else knows? - I don't know anything.
I'm not even from here, you fuck-up.
Mr. Dexter, the coffin's good to go.
okay, let's burn the bitch.
you could zap his chest. It'd be easier.
but we know why you gotta do it down there.
you like looking at his johnson, don't you?
admit it, dude, you got it in you.
enough! Look me in the eyes and tell me you've never been with a man.
fuck you, maricon! Fuck you! - That's what you want, isn't it?
you want to fuck me. - Stop helping. Stop helping.
if you are not gay, just say so. - Fuck you, maricon!
look at him. He can't even say it. - Stop helping!
can't wait to have you as a patient. - Bet you can't.
this is what you want. Here. - Shut up!
take a look. You want some of this right here? Look at this.
just shut up!
Yeah!
homophobes never check there.
thank God you had a gun in there. I thought it was a gay thing...
...like somehow you guys could do that. Sorry.
are you okay? - Not really, no.
gentlemen, let's wrap it up and get out of here.
who's driving? - I tell you what, I'll flip you for it.
all right.
this way, come on. - Shit!
Yeah. - Hey, Harmony, it's me.
Oh, God, how did you get away?
I shot him with a small revolver I keep near my balls.
I can't get to my car. We're near Olive and the freeway. Can you pick us up?
I'm in a van with the body. I'll be there in 30 seconds.
all right, be where I can see you. Be ready to move.
shit, they're on my tail. I gotta go.
right there. She's right there! Shit.
harmony!
harmony!
harmony! - Harry, don't!
come on, we gotta go. They're coming back around. Harmony's down there.
Perry, what's wrong?
come on, breathe.
Harry.
Harold.
Harold...
...Use your awesome might.
save me from this hopeless plight.
Harold...
harmony!
captain Fucking Magic.
come on!
no.
there, all done.
finished.
Harry.
did you call me? - Harry, you're shot.
no, no. Look, you want to see something cool?
cool! This stopped the bullet, Harry.
no, not really.
Oh, Harry.
Oh, God, Harry.
Harry.
Hi. Welcome back. - Yeah.
how many fingers? - Put that cat down, because I'm allergic.
you feeling okay? How's your...?
my what? - Well, your...
everything down there. - I can't believe he told you that.
it's Christmas, where's my present, Slick?
your present is you're not in jail, fag-hag.
Yeah, boo, hiss, I know. Look, I hate it too.
in movies where the studio gets all paranoid about a downer ending...
...so the guy shows up, he's magically alive on crutches, I hate that.
I mean, shit, why not bring them all back.
but the point is, in this case, this time, it really happened.
Perry, like, lived. Yeah, it's a dumb movie thing...
...but what do you want me to do, lie about it?
so you found something out?
Yeah. But you're not gonna like it.
Dexter didn't murder your sister.
that's crazy. He was using my sister to impersonate his daughter, Perry.
never happened. I talked to my police guy.
the ringer was a girl named Mia Frye, 23-year-old from Glendale.
when she wasn't impersonating Veronica Dexter...
...she wore a pink wig.
but my sister sent you up to Big Bear Lake, to his cabin.
your sister was convinced that Dexter was her natural father...
...so she started following him, hanging around.
do you see where I'm going with this?
one day your sister came calling, and she saw Dexter...
...in bed with the pink-haired girl.
what she thought was father and daughter.
remember, that's how it would appear.
it was too much for her.
first the old father, now the shiny new one.
she couldn't handle it, and she took her own life.
what she hired me to film wasn't murder, but incest.
I'm sorry.
so much for unreality.
I said goodbye...
...Watched Jonny's world go back on the fiction shelf.
but while it lasted, brother...
...it was one for the books.
you should've told me you were arrested five times.
I should be pissed.
you should have told me that when you go home, you put on lady's underpants.
that's cross-dressing, imbecile. - Whatever.
half those guys are straight. Perfect fathers, love their kids.
how about you? Did your father love you?
sometimes. You know, when I dressed up like a bottle. How about yours?
well, he used to beat me in Morse code, so it's possible...
...but he never actually said the words.
Harry. - What?
don't steal any more shit.
you're not a punk.
you bet I'll turn around.
you like that, huh?
I saw him in the commissary twice. What is he, like 6'4"?
he doesn't know he's gay. Look how he walks.
so that's pretty much that.
we went back to Indiana, the three of us, for Jenna 's funeral.
don 't worry, I saw the last Lord of the Rings.
I won 't have the movie end 17 times.
there is, though, one final scene for your viewing pleasure.
do I know you?
no. Just in town for the funeral.
what do you want?
the zoo was closed, so I thought I'd come here and look at an animal.
son of a...
who do you think you're talking to?
I buried my daughter today.
no.
you buried her 20 years ago.
harmony was right, her sister was murdered.
you pulled the trigger. It just took this long for the bullet to hit.
who are you?
I loved my girl.
you fucker! If I could get out of this bed...
yeah? Well, you can't.
you bastard!
an old man that can't defend himself.
big tough guy.
Yeah, that's right.
big tough guy.
I prefer Genaros, but what do I know? I'm a bear. I suck the heads off fish.
that's it. That's the true story of what happened last Christmas.
that was some pretty harsh shit with the old guy back there, right?
but whatever, he's creepy. Fuck him. Don't worry about him.
anyhow, so...
thanks for coming.
thanks for taking the trip to L. A. With me.
if I had to sum it up, and I do...
because, you know, it's, like, the end.
I would say that this movie is about... It's about friendship.
friendship is sacred. - What are you doing?
I'm trying to wrap up the movie...
...and leave the people with a message.
I've got a message for you. Get your feet off my fucking desk.
sorry. I work for Perry now.
and stop narrating. - Obviously.
that's it. Please stay for the end credits.
if you're wondering who the best boy is, it's someone's nephew.
don't forget to validate your parking.
for all of you good people in the Midwest...
act the fool, play the calf
and you'll always have the last laugh
wear the cap and the bells
and you'll rate with all the great swells
if you become a doctor, folks'll face you with dread
and if you become a dentist, they'll be glad when you're dead
you'll get a bigger hand if you can stand on your head
be a clown, be a clown, be a clown -Be a clown -Be a clown -All the world -Loves a clown -Show 'em tricks -Tell 'em jokes
and you'll only stop with top folks
be a crack jackanapes
and they'll imitate you like apes
why be a great composer with your rent in arrears?
why be a major poet and you'll owe it for years
when crowds will pay to giggle if you wiggle your ears?
be a clown, be a clown, be a clown
be a clown, be a clown
all the world loves a clown
if you just make them roar
watch your mountebank account soar
wear a painted mustache
and you're sure to make a big splash
a college education I should never propose
a bachelor's degree won't even keep you in clothes
but millions you will win if you can spin on your nose
be a clown, be a clown, be a clown -Give 'em quips -Give 'em quips -Give 'em fun -Give 'em fun
and they'll pay to say you're A-one
if you become a farmer, you'll have the weather to buck
if you become a gambler, you'll be stuck with your luck
but, Jack, you'll never lack if you can quack like a duck
be a clown
be a clown
be a clown
Jesus, though, it was a relief just to have fun and do something trite and not care a damn
and get paid a hundred times what you'd be paid for something good.
I love you under my skin
they'll never know the difference.
what's it going to be called?
what's the dreariest title ever?
I bet Coley $5 that he could never write a song called I Love You.
get your money out. I'm telling you, Louis B. Mayer is going to love this.
he's going to weep.
I need a time of year. A month.
all right, April. -June.
perfect cliche, April.
I love you" hums the April breeze
I love you under my skin
I love you
is it a sin?
certainly not.
I love you
hums the April breeze "I love you
echo the hills "I love you
the golden dawn agrees
as once more she sees daffodils. It's spring again
and birds on the wing again
start to sing again
the old melody "I love you"
that's the song of songs
and it all belongs to you and me
it was just one of those things
just one of those crazy things
it's a real pearl.
go ahead, dear, take it.
it's tiny, but trust me, it's still the biggest thing you can get your fingers around in this crowd.
you'll make big bucks on this. -That's swell.
it's something, isn't it?
Yes, it's lovely.
it's so imaginative to actually have the party at the studio.
is absolutely everything in Hollywood connected to movies?
everything good.
that's why we're trying to coax Cole into permanent residency.
how would half of every year be?
I think Hollywood's fantastic, it's like living on the moon.
or 20, 000 leagues under the sea.
when we started painting the town,
can you believe this?
Linda, Hollywood was your idea, not mine.
now you're acting like it's the worst place on earth.
I had thought that the change of weather might be good for us both.
I had no idea how hot the climate would really be.
the climate is good for growing flowers.
everything grows wild, Cole.
and the pickings are far too easy.
now and then it was great fun.
but it was just one of those things. -Mr. Porter, how are you? -Mr. Nelson.
what you did with that song is just splendid.
I'd love to introduce you to my wife.
Cole, I hope we could coax you into a song.
be right back.
good song. -Thank you.
there's a plan for later.
Linda's being very prickly tonight, but I'll try to get away.
plenty of companies lined up? -Good companies, I promise.
thank you all. This is indeed an honor and a surprise.
obviously L. B. wants you all to get home early...
that's why he's asked me to sing.
so here goes.
before you leave these portals to meet less fortunate mortals,
there's just one final message I would give to you
now you all have learned reliance
on the sacred teachings of science
so I hope through life you never will decline
in spite of philistine defiance
to do what all good scientists do
experiment
make it your motto day and night
experiment
it will lead you to the light
if this advice you'll only employ
the future can offer you infinite joy and merriment
experiment
and you'll see
good night.
thank you.
what a marvelous song! I don't know it, do you?
intimately.
you seem very happy, dear.
I am, darling. I wish you were.
excuse me. -The Springs will take care of that.
I was actually thinking of going to Arizona.
it's so much further.
I don't mind.
I expect I'll be gone by the time you come home.
love for sale
appetizing young love for sale
love that's fresh and still unspoiled
love that's only slightly soiled

who will buy?
who would like to sample my supply?
who's prepared to pay the price for a trip to paradise?
love for sale
let the poets pipe of love in their childish way
I know every type of love better far than they
if you want the thrill of love
I've been through the mill of love
old love, new love
every love but true love
love for sale
appetizing young love for sale
if you want to buy my wares, follow me and climb the stairs
love for sale
aren't there always copies of those sorts of photographs anyway?
Cole wanted a set for himself.
these are not blackmail pictures, Linda, they're
Mrs. Porter.
they were taken for recreational purposes.
Cole has a heedless appetite for life. I'm sure we agree he needs to be protected.
you became devoted so very quickly, Mr. Reed.
he is so easy to love.
beyond devotion, what are your ambitions?
I have thought of my own theatrical agency. It would be a company that would keep their clients' best interests close to heart, always.
as you and I do Cole's.
of course. And how many backers do you require?
only one, Mrs. Porter.
just let me know how much.
I'll leave these with you.
you don't sweat, do you? Not a drop.
I don't believe in wasting my resources.
goodbye, Linda.
it's the wrong song in the wrong style.
though your smile is lovely, it's the wrong smile.
it's not her smile, but such a lovely smile.
but it's all right with me.
welcome home.
aren't you pleased?
about the roses? -Yes.
they're glorious. Are they for me?
who else?
one never knows.
what's wrong, Linda?
your friend Bobby Reed has been to see me...
with his nefarious portfolio.
Yes, he told me.
he told you? -Yes.
I paid him, too, you know.
no, I didn't know.
Yes, he's an ambitious fellow.
it's all right.
I don't think it's all right, Cole. I think it's disgusting.
he's exploiting both of us.
well, yes.
I like to look at it as a kind of luxury tax.
a luxury tax?
what an extraordinary thing to say.
do you have any idea how much you've changed?
how much your behavior has changed?
you have put everything that you've accomplished with your music at risk.
darling, my work has never been better.
it's flourishing. Even if we're not.
your music comes from your talent, not from your behavior.
it's all the same thing. I can't put my talent here and my behavior here...
and my eating, sleeping, and drinking habits.
it's all me.
I have never asked you to change.
just be discreet.
Linda, I have never been discreet.
what is discretion but dishonesty wrapped up in a little good breeding?
I don't think you want me to be discreet, I think you want me to be different.
I am partially responsible for all of this...
because I have spoiled you, I have indulged you.
but so has the entire goddamned world.
and for what?
just a little music.
Linda hated being late for anything. And the next day she was late for lunch.
I only had to hear the clock strike and look at her empty place at the table to know she was gone.
gone back to Paris.
it's quite simple, really.
two people who wanted too much from each other.
porter residence.
hold one moment.
sir. -Not now.
it's urgent, sir.
yes?
all the money, all the music had deflected reality for so long...
I didn't know that everything we had was so fragile.
hold it loose, hold it tight.
everything breaks.
I'm going to take them to Paris next week.
all of this is just...
got to get back to a better place.
and it would be good to see Linda.
morning, Cole.
are we the only ones up?
our hostess just retired.
I've been up since 5: 00.
writing another hit, I'm sure.
I wish it was that easy.
nothing comes easy anymore.
and when it does, it's lousy.
I write better in my own place or the Murphys'.
I'm going to swear off these house parties until I finish this score.
remind me I said that, will you?
that melody sounds like it could go somewhere.
Yeah, like out for a drink.
have you heard from Linda?
no.
no. I've written, I've wired, I've called. Nothing.
I'm sorry, Cole, I'm really sorry. Maybe with time...
it'll take more than time.
I'll be back before breakfast.
just seemed so much to ask children to bear.
how long will you stay?
no idea.
let's go inside, it's getting cold.
you see how far I'll go to get you back?
I think you've gone too far this time, but I ought to be used to it by now.
I'm afraid his right leg should be amputated.
perhaps the left as well. There's really no alternative.
if you amputate his legs, you will cut out his pride.
you'll break his spirit, and he would never work again.
he'll have nothing without his music. It's the essence of him.
he'd have nothing to live for.
he would have his life, his friends, you.
nothing. He would just be living out his death.
you're asking a lot of him.
we are accustomed to asking a lot of one another.
so what did the sawbones say?
you get to keep the old things. And he expects you to walk, and so do l.
but only if I can walk to you.
as far as Williamstown?
Williamstown?
massachusetts. I found a very pretty home.
it's on a hill. It has a work space.
thinking of buying it.
a little bump.
all right. -Now?
a grand piano.
that is grand.
that's not quite right.
so shall I leave you to it?
guess you'd be better.
God, I can't work the pedal.
can't work the pedals, dear.
God damn it!
I can't work the pedals!
and what did it take to finally work the pedals?
a few years.
a pharmacopoeia of pills.
a reservoir of Scotch and 20 more operations.
nonstop fun.
but over time, you got five shows up and running.
up? Yes. Running? Barely.
at least, according to the critics,
not up to Mr. Porter's usual standards..."
was the refrain.
so when Hollywood finally called again?
I was on the train before the second ring.
he is the same. One of Yale's sons of whom we are all proud.
Cole Porter.
there's an, oh, such a hungry yearning
burning inside of me
and its torment won't be through
till you let me spend my life making love to you
day and night
night and day
if I can survive this movie, I can survive anything.
and you shall, darling, beautifully, like everything else.
thank you.
the movie will do very well, and you'll be encouraged.
I wonder, it seems like every time they operate, I lose songs as well as blood.
remind me to call the studio and tell them how much we "absolutely loved the movie.
naturally.
sorry. I'm all right.
why on earth does Linda come back to Cole anyway?
because he's Cary Grant.
and she misses the music, as do l.
I must say, going down in history as Cary Grant is not too bad.
not for a boy from lndiana.
we should be grateful to them. They found us a happy ending.
Yes, happy endings.
you don't get many of those, do you, in Hollywood?
so this promises what, surgery number 25?
Twenty-six.
good God. And how long will I have to wear the cast this time?
a few months, we'll see how you mend.
what's that?
it's Linda.
it's gotten that bad, then?
even if she'd agree, I don't think surgery would help.
the lungs are too damaged.
Dr. Moorhead, are you saying that Linda is dying?
God, what a swell party this is
four weeks, you rehearse and rehearse
three weeks, and it couldn't be worse
one week, will it ever be right?
then out of the hat, it's that big first night
the overture is about to start
you cross your fingers and hold your heart
it's curtain time and off we go
another opening of another show
miss Morrison, the line is "away we go," not "off we go," dear.
you couldn't manage to make me hear you before...
and now that I can hear you, you've got it wrong.
so shall we do it again? Let's pick it up, dust it off, and get it right.
the tempo was good.
all right, everyone, let's go.
one week, will it ever be right?
then out of the hat, it's that big first night
the overture is about to start
you cross your fingers and hold your heart
it's curtain time and away we go
another opening
just another opening of another show
very good. Thank you, all.
carry on. And chorus keep those consonants crisp.
the audience shouldn't think you're saying, "An annoying opening for an ugly show.
let them come to that conclusion on their own.
please stop that knocking.
Mr. Porter. -What?
your wife sent me to fetch you.
fetch me for what?
for tea. -I don't like tea.
it's just a few steps. She's waiting.
fine, come in. Fetch me, for Christ's sake.
who are you, anyway? -Bill, Bill Wrather.
bill rather? Rather what?
bill Wrather. Yes, you're Linda's...
decorating wizard. Yes. -It's a great pleasure for me, Mr. Porter.
the pleasure is mine.
can l? -No.
are you sure? -No. Lots of practice.
I will take an arm, actually. Thank you.
well, I'll be making my way.
Linda, a pleasure as always.
indeed.
I'll see you soon.
Cole, that tune you were playing was just beautiful.
I can't wait to hear that in the show.
goodbye now. -Safe drive.
lsn't he delightful? -Lovely.
we've become such fast friends.
I was hoping that you might as well.
he'd be a good companion for you.
Linda?
I don't want you to be lonely.
I'm worried about you.
you don't need to worry about me or your show, it's all taken care of.
I'm in God's hands. The show is in yours.
I do wish it were the other way round, though.
give me that cigarette.
strange, dear.
but true, dear.
when I'm close to you, dear.
the stars fill the sky.
this really needs a proper singer. I really can't do it justice.
wait till opening night. Hear it sung well.
I think it sounds fine right now.
and I won't be there, dear.
what are you talking about? Why wouldn't you be?
you know the doctors, honey, they're so boring.
I don't think I would add very much to it.
I'm sure it will be a great occasion.
it won't be any occasion if you're not there.
darling, Bill will be with you.
he'll help you.
I wrote this for you. What's the point of doing it if you're not gonna be there?
well, that's why I want you to play it for me.
all the way through.
all right.
I won't do it justice, but I'll do it.
strange, dear, but true, dear
when I'm close to you, dear
the stars fill the sky
so in love with you am I
even without you
my arms fold about you
you know, darling, why
so in love with you am I
in love with the night mysterious
the night when you first were there
in love with my joy delirious -Wait. -Are you all right?
a few people may have been carried out of my shows...
but no one's ever been carried in.
so taunt me and hurt me
deceive me, desert me
I'm yours till I die
so in love
so in love
so in love with you, my love
think of Linda a little and applaud a lot.
in love with the night mysterious
the night when you first were there
in love with my joy delirious
when I knew that you could care
so taunt me
and hurt me
deceive me
desert me
I'm yours till I die
so in love
so in love
so in love with you my love, am I
in love with the night mysterious
the night when you first were there
in love with my joy delirious
when I knew that you could care
so taunt me
and hurt me
deceive me
desert me
I'm yours till I die
so in love
so in love
so in love my love am I
Bravo!
sorry, we have to move on.
please, let me enjoy this.
it took two years to get the backers interested in this show.
no one wanted anything to do with it, they thought I was finished.
we have to move on.
very well.
we make quite a pair, don't we?
we're still les colporteurs of Paris.
plying our humble trade.
I could hear the score.
darling, it's giddy.
it's all about Paris.
brings back fond memories.
those were fine days. -Yes, they were.
and we were fine. -We were fine.
finding each other.
taking care of each other.
I have a little something for you.
it's a whole new flower.
a gentleman in Spain did it up for me.
it's a hybrid of two varieties of rose...
thought to be completely incompatible.
yet look at it, it's perfect.
the Linda Porter rose.
exquisite.
it's just a pale reflection of our life together.
it wasn't all beautiful.
you were always my life to be.
I remember that song. -lt was about you.
they were all about you.
not all of them.
but some, I hope.
how I have loved you, Cole.
I don't know how much longer I can stay.
would you mind terribly if I went just a little early?
every time we say goodbye
I die a little
every time we say goodbye
I wonder why a little
why the gods above me who must be in the know
think so little of me they allow you to go
when you're near there's such an air of spring about it
I can hear a lark somewhere begin to sing about it
there's no love song finer
but how strange the change from major to minor
every time we say goodbye
goodbye
Sara.
Hello, darling.
Gerald.
how is he?
Cole is already seated.
he doesn't want anyone to feel awkward about the leg.
he would still have the damn thing if Linda were here.
and Monty was by for a visit. He asked to be remembered, of course.
good old Monty.
noted.
so, Cole, when are we gonna get another lyric from you?
I haven't the wit nor the will to write any more.
Cole, you can write from everything you remember.
you've had the most fascinating life.
Sara.
memories.
it's like the phantom pains I get in my missing leg.
they're not real and they hurt too much.
I'm a toy balloon that's fated soon to pop.
Cole, please. Don't.
Oh, my God.
my dear friends, I'm boring you.
let us repair to the living room for some goodbyes...
and some coffee and some traveling music, shall we?
bill is all packed, and you all have a long drive ahead of you.
the invitation was for the weekend.
let's pretend it's Sunday.
we'll be right there.
Sara. -All right, dear.
I wish you'd let me stay with you, Cole. I want to stay.
bill, please, let me at least try to do something noble, all right?
what I'm trying to do is best for both of us.
then can't both of us decide, not just you?
my sweet boy, there's nothing for you here.
come on now, get the wheelchair.
it's the wrong time and the wrong place
though your face is charming it's the wrong face
it's not her face
that was evil. I'm sorry.
I think you're trying very hard to misbehave.
and you used to be a better actor. -I used to be better at a lot of things.
at words poetic, I'm so pathetic
that I always have found it best Instead of getting them off my chest
to let them rest, unexpressed
you're the top
you're the Coliseum
you're the top
go on, get out of here.
get outta town
Cole, by all means
before it's too late, my love
take it easy, old friend.
get outta town
be good to me please
why wish me harm?
take care of him.
why not retire to a farm and be contented to charm the birds off the trees?
we love you.
it's done
the little dream, it's done
so bid me a fond farewell we both had our fun
Cole.
was it Romeo or Juliet who said when about to die "Love is not all peaches and cream
little dream -Goodbye. -Goodbye.
goodbye
lonely, miserable, melancholy
what a perfect musical finale.
don't worry.
never open on a ballad, never end on one either.
do you hear that playing? -Yes, we hear that playing -Do you know who's playing? -No, who is that playing?
well it's Gabriel, Gabriel playing Gabriel, Gabriel saying "Will you be ready to go when I blow my horn?
Oh, blow, Gabriel blow
go on and blow, Gabriel, blow
I've been a sinner, I've been a scamp
but now I'm willing to trim my lamp So blow, Gabriel, blow
Oh, I was low, Gabriel, low
mighty low, Gabriel, low
but now since I have seen the light I'm good by day and I'm good by night
so blow, Gabriel, blow
go on and blow, Gabriel, blow
I want to join your happy band
and play all day in the Promised Land So blow, Gabriel, blow
blow, Gabriel, blow
blow, Gabriel, blow
blow, Gabriel, blow
blow Gabriel, blow, blow, blow
I want to join your happy band And play all day in the Promised Land
so blow, Gabriel, blow
blow, Gabriel, blow
blow, Gabriel, blow
in the still of the night
as I gaze from my window at the moon in its flight
my thoughts all stray to you
in the still of the night
while the world is in slumber
Oh, the times without number
darling, when I say to you "Do you love me "as I love you?
are you my life to be "my dream come true?
or will this dream of mine fade out of sight
like the moon growing dim on the rim of the hill, in the chill still of the night?
like the moon growing dim on the rim of the hill, in the chill still of the night?
that may just be baby talk, but, Stan...
...Look at them and tell me they're not communicating.
honey, this is a big day.
when you're in business with Biscane Broadcasting, you've hit the big time.
Hello? -Honey, did you hear anything I said?
Yes, Of course I heard you. -What did I say?
What'd you say?
I said, don't you think the babies are communicating?
honey, where's my jacket?
hello. Yeah. Hi, is this Biscane Broadcasting?
Hi, this is Stan Bobbins.
no, not Dan. Stan.
Oh, and those World War ll rescue missions?
what kind of milk you drinking?
what? -A baby...
...who can perform superhuman feats...
...Communicate to both babies and adults...
...and defend the children of the world.
that creates a paradox which defies rational elucidation.
in English, Finkleman.
I think he's saying you're full of.
sorry. -What kind of milk you drinking, Alex?
and you're trying to tell us...
...that this Kahuna is related to both you and your cousins Sly and Whit?
Oh, whoa. Wait a minute. What don't you understand?
look, sit back and let me tell you another story...
...About the legendary Kahuna and his archenemy, Captain Kane.
this one happened a long, long time ago...
...in East Berlin in 1962.
you know, the Berlin Wall and all that stuff?
now, we've heard about all kinds of superheroes.
Superman, Superwoman, Superthis, Superthat.
and they always do super things and save everybody.
but this is the story of a real superhero...
...a little boy who looks after the children of the world.
all the children.
showtime.
locking in four-wheel drive.
Kahuna 's archenemy, Captain Kane, had dreams of controlling the world.
and he did all kinds of bad things.
my dear Petrov. -Captain Kane.
always a pleasure to see you.
to our work. -To our work.
it's wonderful what you do here, saving orphaned children.
I have a soft spot for the gentle laughter of babies.
Kane knew if he could control children, he could control the world.
he captured children trying to escape through the Berlin Wall...
...and sent them to his secret camps all over East Germany.
capturing orphaned children?
if you think the Kahuna was about to let Kane get away with that...
...Think again.
if there were ever children who needed his help, these were them.
I'm scared, Peter.
it's okay, Greta. We'll find a way out of this.
that could've hurt someone.
it's a boy. -It's a boy?
it's what? -Who're you?
name's Kahuna, and I'm busting you kids out of here.
he's saving us. He's saving us.
all right, let's go.
this tunnel leads to the courtyard of the U. S. Embassy.
go straight to Ambassad or Clark. Tell him Kahuna sent you.
thank you, Mr. Kahuna. -Just doing my job, miss.
Greta, hurry. -You did good, kid.
good luck.
mobilize every soldier in the compound...
...and secure the perimeter. Kahuna must not escape.
...and secure the perimeter. Kahuna must not escape.
search this building. All sectors.
sergeant, send four units ahead to the Wall.
seal off the compound. Find those brats. I want Kahuna.
Hey, prissy pants, don't wet yourself. I'm right here.
so we meet again...
...my little archenemy. -You better watch it, Kane.
those things'll kill you. -And those things...
...will give you cavities.
that's okay, I've still got my baby teeth.
it's the end of the road for you.
don't I get one last word? -That's a little cliche, don't you think?
but I'm intrigued.
what is your last word?
duck.
"Duck" is your last word? "Duck."
duck!
my leg. His machine has damaged my leg.
get him!
what are you waiting for? -Bottle!
get him before he.
No! Too late.
you see? You see?
I told you. It's too late.
now it's over. No.
look at that. I warned you.
it's playtime.
one potato, two potato, three potato, four.
five potato, six potato, seven potato, more.
didn't your mothers tell you not to play with guns?
I'll do it.
I'll finish you off.
one day I will be-- I will destroy you if it takes me forever.
and then Kahuna utilized his turbojet propulsion...
...and jumped that Mustang right over the Berlin Wall.
a Mustang GT at the Berlin Wall...
...Back in the '60s? -Man, you tripping, Archie.
that's how the Kahuna saved the orphans of East Berlin.
any questions? Rosita?
still not convinced, Finkleman?
cool it, Archie. It's your mom and dad. Act like babies.
somebody pick up the phone. -Are you having a good day?
ls that Daniel and Jasmine? -Jean, l.
Hi, guys. -I don't know why you're opposed.
this will put Bobbins' World on the map.
allowing a huge satellite network access to this facility...
...and using kids as marketing subjects...
...It's everything we stand against. -It's about marketing.
Bobbins' World will be the McDonald's of daycare.
great. We'll be known as McBaby.
honey, this is new territory for you...
...maybe you should talk to Dan first.
he's out of the country working for UNlCEF.
besides, I'm running Bobbins' World now. Okay?
I don't need to run to big brother Dan, the baby guru, for help.
Archie's father could give him a bit more attention sometimes.
who needs that junk? Better he learn up-front that it's a cold, cruel world...
...and you gotta tough it out on your own. Heck, I don't need nobody.
ever consider sensitivity training?
I am gonna-- Okay, I am gonna turn Bobbins' World...
...into the biggest chain of daycare centers in the world.
man, I'm hungry. Yo, Mrs. B, girl needs a snack!
for the last time, Rosita, the adults don't understand our language.
to attract their attention, One must speak...
...in the only baby language they seem to comprehend.
which is?
Oh, yeah. Crying.
here we go.
I need to ask you a question about the big-screen monitor.
honey the kids are hungry. Michelle, bring some bottles.
Sharon, can you get some bottles here? Thank goodness.
works every time.
my leg. This leg is always killing me.
tell them to get away. -Not now.
Mr. Biscane, Mr. Bobbins.
pleasure. -Dan?
it's Stan.
he likes you.
I like him.
okay, sweeties, today is Wednesday...
...which means we have a very special guest for storytime.
that's right, kiddies. My name's Kylie, sweetheart. Hey.
I don't like to brag about her, even though she is an honor student...
...the most beautiful girl in school and the president of the literature club.
Oh, Archie. Come on. Come on, Finkie. Come and sit down.
we are gonna read about Cinderella.
once upon a time, a lovely young girl named Cinderella...
...Lived in a grand mansion with her stepmother and two stepsisters.
kylie reads with passion. The words literally dance right off the page.
looks like someone's in love. -Peasant.
finkleman and Kylie sitting in a tree
K-I-s-s-I-n-g.
knock it off, you mugs. The lady's trying to work.
what are you guys blabbering about?
Oh, they're not babbling. They're talking.
I just wish we could understand what they're talking about.
Mr. Bill Biscane.
the chairman of Biscane Satellite Systems.
thank you so much. Thank you.
thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
we are here to celebrate the future.
not a future of flying cars and spaceships.
the real future is in the hands of one group. Our children.
I have a soft spot for the gentle laughter of babies.
what did he say? -And so it is my greatest pleasure...
...to announce the launch of the largest children's network...
...in television history. It will be delivered...
...Via the new Biscane Telespace 3000 Satellite.
and we call this network Kidz Everywhere.
we will take input from the children themselves, making this the first...
...True interactive network by kids for kids.
it's him. It's Biscane. -Sadly...
...Dan Bobbins cannot be here with us.
we have, on behalf of Bobbins' World...
...Dan Bobbins' half brother, Stanley.
Mr. Bobbins?
I'm his real brother. -Doesn't matter.
thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
this has been a dream of mine for quite a while now and...
it's coming together now. I can finally see your plan in all its magnificence.
as I've told you many times before...
...I will win, even if it takes forever.
that's Captain Kane, from Berlin.
sweetie, what're you doing in here? Looking out at all the exciting things?
you should get with the other kids. Yeah.
ladies and gentlemen, if I may have your attention...
Oh, my gosh, guys. Biscane. I think he's Kane!
sometimes, Archie, I think all you do is blurt out the first thing...
...that pops into your mind. -I'm not a brain baby.
I'm a baby of action. All right, maybe it's not him.
anyway, Biscane, I don't like him.
what are we gonna do about this Biscane?
no fear, Finkie's here. -Quentin Finkleman...
...you're just the guy I'm looking for. -Okay then, what's our plan this time?
we're not supposed to be here.
I'm getting sick to my stomach.
okay, Finkleman, you're the computer geek. Now what?
I prefer the term "computer artisan." -Whatever.
all right, all right. Type in "Bill Biscane."
ignore the official sites for Biscane Broadcasting...
...or anything like that. There's usually some rogue ones.
you know, anti-corporate sites.
what's wrong with you, Finkleman? -I feel faint.
you're always scared. -Look!
see what it says up there? Criminal!
Biscane. It says he's a corporate criminal.
are you crazy? That's just website spam.
red alert! It's Biscane's flunkies!
what do we do? -Run!
come on, Fink. -Wait, don't leave me!
Oh, no!
come on.
this building wasn't up to code.
Meaning? -I couldn't possibly do it.
you have to do until tomorrow what's necessary.
that's impossible. -People.
we won't have a problem with building inspectors.
Mr. Biscane has paid off thousands of petty bureaucrats...
...from here to New York.
what have I done?
what was that? -It's a baby.
and he overheard everything we said.
what's he gonna do, call the FBl?
get him. He knows something.
tell us what you know. -oh, no.
Hey, pock face.
it's him! It's the Kahuna! I knew he'd come!
pick on somebody half your size. -I knew it.
who the heck are you?
your worst nightmare. A small fry with a big attitude.
have a seat.
you a gambling man?
heads, I win. Tails, you lose.
heads, I win. Tails, you lose.
that was fun. But we gotta run. See you.
find that brat. -That was Kahuna.
I knew he'd come.
that was Kahuna.
I'm sorry that we panicked. -I thought for sure you'd be a goner.
Yeah, I was until the Kahuna saved me.
Archie, this is getting serious.
you believe me, don't you, Rosita?
I believe Kahuna was with you, in spirit.
you'd best have a talk with your inner adult.
inner adult.
what about my computer? -A new one will be here.
we'll take care of everything. -A wig.
that's gotta be Kahuna's disguise.
the kids will be out of the way when your men are working tomorrow.
don't worry about that. -Poor Archie.
Yeah. He's got serious abandonment issues.
we all have issues. -Speak for yourself, brain boy.
I just mean that you quite possibly have aggression issues...
...which may be tied to a theme of mistrust...
...and, ultimately, fear of love. -I don't have aggression issues.
don't make me pound on you to prove it.
okay, Mrs.Tyson, don't bite my ear off.
Brandon.
Brandon, thanks so much for coming by. This is so cool of you.
I was pretty sure I know why you called.
so I got here right away. -Okay, here it goes.
I know the guy usually asks.
it's cool. I was gonna ask you anyway.
I mean, everyone knows what a brainiac you are.
even the coach said so. -Brainiac?
you know, I've gotta, like, make a C-average to play football.
and I felt kind of weird asking you to tutor me so...
...I'm glad you're asking me first. -Tutor you. Right.
you don't have any plans, right? -No. No plans.
cool.
jerk. I hate jocks.
three thousand dollars for books.
uncle Stan, can I walk the kids over to the children's museum?
no. Go ahead, Kylie. They'll probably love it.
Kylie?
Hey, you okay? -I just need to get out for a while.
nothing short of a miracle. -That's what Biscane's paying for.
quit the jabbering, give me the blooming disk.
thirty million dollars' worth. -Try 60.
look out.
you got them? God, that was close.
stupid girl!
hope it's all right.
what? -Nothing. Nothing.
Oh, my God, it's gone. Without that disk, we're sunk.
I could feel Kylie's heart shatter into a million pieces.
poor Kylie. -Man, if that were me...
...I would've popped him in the kisser.
we have a problem.
Oh, no, I'm getting nauseous again.
go on, mister. -Go on.
go on. What do you want?
I don't know what's going on. We gotta get out of here. Hold on, kids.
fasten your seatbelts. This might be a bumpy ride.
what do you want?
leave us alone!
what-- -The.
heck?
it's the Kahuna.
let's even the odds, shall we, boys? Bottle up.
it's the Kahuna!
I told you he's real.
Oh, my God.
I love him!
it truly is the Kahuna.
who are you? What are you? -No time for small talk.
we gotta boogie, little lady. -Boogie? okay, but this is nuts.
scan engine specs. Mold ignition key.
okay, what is going on? -Key ready.
all right. Let's go.
warning: objects in mirror are stupider than they appear.
metal to the pedal.
Oops, forgot something.
no, I didn't.
see you. Wouldn't wanna be you.
I will control the minds of the children...
...Through their own television sets.
a mind-control pulse will come through Muggles the Frog.
muggles doesn't look like a frog.
he looks like a zucchini. This is irritating.
as irritating as a.
what is it, Crowe? Good news, I hope?
the attempt to recover the disk...
it was unsuccessful.
this is not good news.
where is the girl now?
she escaped. -Escaped?
you're not going to believe this. -Try me.
my men report that she was spirited away...
...By some sort of mini-- -Kahuna.
Kahuna is here.
suddenly I'm feeling weak. -Let's sit down.
sir. -Get me something.
what can I get you, sir? -Soda pop.
diet or regular? -What's the difference?
feel my head. Is it hot? Is it cold? Tell me the truth.
you're perfectly normal. -Normal?
you're not a real doctor. Where's my soda pop?
get me my globe.
I don't want this umbrella. I'm a sick man.
then you did a bunch of back flips, then you waded in garbage cans...
...and you kicked them. Then you put that garbage can on the guy's head.
and then you did karate moves. And then you got them all tied up...
...and then you spun them around a bunch.
then that guy tried to hit you, and he hit the other goon by accident.
then you knocked them down and ran up that wall like Spider-Man.
that was cool. You saved us. And they were afraid of you.
those goons were afraid of you. You saved us.
we're related, you know. Part of the Bobbins' World, along with my dad...
...and my cousins Sly and Whit. I bet I know why you're here. It's Biscane.
he's Kane. -This has to be a dream.
your archenemy, right? I knew it.
what's it like to have super strengths and super gadgets--?
easy on the gummy bears. The sugar's getting to you.
it was Biscane's men who tried to nab you.
my guess is, he's up to something with Bobbins' World.
all right, everybody, you can relax now. You're safe here.
wow, this is totally off the hook.
all aboard.
this is your ride? -Welcome to my playground.
Wow.
amazing.
my God. -This is one bad Batcave.
magnificent. A baby utopia. -This place is the bomb.
it's my world of holograms. We can create any dream you can dream.
send in the clowns.
Wow. -What is this place?
wanna see my pets? -Yeah. Cool.
Oh, my God. -Holograms make great watchdogs...
...and you don't have to feed them.
Oh no, a bear. A bear. -It's a bear.
a bear!
and now the king.
now, is he on a chain? Tell me he's on a chain.
come on, Fink, sing with me.
we're here. -Wow.
we're here. I have to see this. Okay, Finkie.
all ashore who's going ashore.
watch your step, Alex.
off we go, Rosita. -Kylie, me too.
come on, Arch. -Hey, Archie, come over here.
wait for me. -This is cool.
go take a look around. You won't believe what you see.
how come you still understand baby talk?
I never forgot it.
you guys go have fun. I have work to do.
I imagine you do.
Hello, miss. Care to give the old lmagination Station a go?
inside of every child is the ability to be anything you want.
believe in yourself, and the lmagination Station...
...will take care of the rest.
maybe another time.
but nice accent, Ringo.
we wanna try it. -Yeah, can we do it? Can we go?
we all wanna go, furry-hat man. -This is a motley little group, isn't it?
Hey, he's cool. He talks baby.
the four of you, eh? Right. Hop on in then.
and let your inner dreams soar.
find the circles. Stand on the circles.
in you go.
let's get this party going. -Let's go, Ringo.
let's do it! -Okay, boss.
Where's my car seat?
wait a minute, we ain't strapped in.
we're gonna be launched into space!
kahuna, are you sure this is safe?
Archie, your hidden strength is the power of your mind.
you are Brain Boy.
Quentin Finkleman, you have more strength than you realize.
you are Baby Courageous.
rosita, as tough as you are, you have a vast depth of love.
you are Cupid Girl.
Alex, you are brimming with energy and joy.
you are Bouncing Boy.
yo, Kahuna, this thing's busted.
what are you talking about?
what do you mean, it's busted?
I'm not smart enough to be Brain Boy.
and Finkleman sure isn't tough enough to be Baby Courageous.
and hello, me, Cupid Girl?
that's okay. I like bouncing.
the only thing I love better than being left alone is a good right hook.
maybe it is busted then. Or maybe the machine's just seeing the real you.
think about it.
all right, I'll change it back. Hang on. -Okay.
strawberries and cream, madam?
coffee and pie? -oh, my God.
this place definitely rates a 1 0 on the weirdness scale.
milk shake? Banana split? Anything to suit your fancy, ma'am.
beat it! -I say, tea and biscuits, madam?
beat it! -I say, tea and biscuits, madam?
shut up. Don't open your mouth.
I don't wanna hear one word out of that plastic face.
I was wrong. This makes 1 000 on the weirdness scale.
lt does seem like that sometimes. -Great, another ghost boy.
I told you guys to beat it.
Oops, you're real. -Yeah.
I'm Zack.
I'm confused.
maybe I can help you here.
you mean he designed all this himself?
you bet. And he's got places like this in Switzerland, China and Argentina.
he really is a superbaby. -Super Kahuna.
have a little respect. The man is over 7 years old.
and this is what we like to call the Com Center.
it's our global communications system.
we can talk to anyone in the world at any time.
Kylie, I see you've met Zack.
what's that? -5: 00. Time to check in. Watch this.
Hey, Whoops, it's me. -Mr. K.
Oh, finally. -Sorry to be so long getting back...
ls that...? -Yeah.
I went to the graduation. Remember the kids we got from Thailand?
Yeah. -My goodness.
if you had seen their faces.
they're at Yale. They asked for you. They love you.
so we'll talk again soon. You'll call me this time?
I promise. -Thank you.
no problem. Hey, guys, what's up? -Hey, guys, I got him. K.
K! -What's up, buddy?
we wanna let you know, we checked out that situation for you.
Yes, everything you said was right. But the kids are 1 1 0 percent safe.
great, guys. -Scratches on the tricycle are minor.
we'll fix those.
tell him about the superhero theme song we've been writing for you.
Yeah! -It's really good!
cool.
that was great. -Mr. K, that's all we have right now.
next time you call it'll be done, I promise you.
but for now, you're the greatest-- -We have the president on line.
later, K. -Bye!
Oh, my gosh! -Can you hold for a moment?
what is it? -The time.
my Uncle Stan's gonna freak out. -Don't worry.
I'm sure he's handling it just fine.
I'm freaking out. -Honey, I'm sure they'll be okay.
I'm freaking out. -Honey, I'm sure they'll be okay.
what is Kylie thinking taking the children out for so long?
Kylie's very responsible.
honey, hold this.
yes?
are you Stan Bobbins? -Yes.
I'm Capt.Baker of the San Diego Police Department.
we have your niece, your son, and three other babies here.
Oh, my gosh. Are they okay?
they're fine. Everything's great.
well, what happened? -Well, apparently they walked too far.
your niece attempted to get a bus, but it was a one-way Greyhound...
...and it couldn't stop until they got to San Diego.
Hi, Uncle Stan, Aunt Jean. -Hi, sweetie.
I'll pick them up.
negative, sir. You'll never make it in time.
there's a two-tanker pileup on the 405 Freeway.
we'll put them up in a hotel tonight.
under police protection, of course.
and we'll get nannies to look after the kids.
well, I don't know. -No, no, no.
we'll watch them like a hawk.
I'll drive up in the morning.
it'll be great. It'll be fun, like a slumber party.
what do you think?
at least we know they're safe.
with traffic shut down, we won't get there...
...Till the middle of the night. -See you tomorrow.
good luck on the big premiere, uncle Stan.
Thanks, Kylie. Hey, and Kylie...
...I'm glad you're okay.
Bye, Archie. Bye, kids.
big kisses. -Bye, bye.
good night.
Hi, Mommy. Hi, Daddy.
Night-night.
okay, we bought some time. Now what?
I have to find out what Biscane is up to with Bobbins' World.
and stop him before it's too late.
I spent 30 million dollars and 1 0 years of my life.
so why is my most elaborate and important operation...
...in danger of being brought down?
because your men couldn't catch a teenage girl?
Yes. -No!
no. -I know who is lurking behind this.
who? -Kahuna.
that makes sense.
I hate this bit.
it's unbelievable.
here I am on the threshold of my ultimate dream...
...and as always, Kahuna seeks to destroy it.
what shall we do?
Hey, Archie. Up here.
whoa, what are you doing up there? -Relaxation, Arch.
it's all about synchronizing the mind and the body.
kahuna, where did you get your powers?
sorry, kid, it's just a story I don't like to tell.
listen, I like you, Archie. You got guts.
in fact, you remind me of me when I was a baby.
Really? -Really.
well, I'm gonna prove myself to you. I'm gonna join your team.
and we can be real superheroes.
before you take that path, look at what you'd be leaving behind.
what, diaper rash? -The love of your parents.
I didn't have a choice, Arch. You do.
come on, now. Time for you and your baby buddies to get some shuteye.
good night, Kahuna.
good night, Archie. -Sweet dreams.
we shall go forward as planned. -As planned.
but, sir...
...what about Kahuna and the disk?
what about Kahuna and the disk?
we get it back.
I have in my mind...
...Developing a little surprise for Mr. Kahuna.
how do we find him? We don't know his location.
we don't need to.
I make it so that he finds me. -Bravo!
so do you know baby language too?
I can't speak it well, but I can understand a little bit.
how did you meet Kahuna?
he found me in a Russian orphanage. I was alone and scared.
my father died, and no one knew where my mom was.
why was he there?
he was helping match up parents with their lost kids.
he tried but could never find my mom.
that's when he took me in.
Hey, Zack.
how does Kahuna--? You know.
help save the world, disarm bad guys, drive turbo-powered baby buggies?
Yeah. -It's quite a story.
parts I learned from Kahuna. Some I found out on my own.
where the facts end and the legend begins...
...no one really knows for sure.
you see, Kahuna's father was a scientist.
one of the best. He lived and worked in a secret American Army base...
...in Germany after the First World War.
after he saw the horrible conditions the soldiers suffered during the war...
...he dedicated his time to developing a kind of super vitamin formula.
a formula to unlock the area in the brain...
... That gives children their amazing energy.
the soldiers who lived in harsh environments, with low food rations...
... Would have a better chance of survival.
but he created something even more powerful.
a sort of fountain of youth formula...
... Which actually stopped the aging process.
because Kahuna 's father was widowed...
...he took his sons everywhere. The babies competed for attention.
shut up. Stop crying, you little brat.
Kenny...
...would you be nice to your little brother?
I've told you this before.
Kahuna's father worried that the enemy would realize...
...the potential of his formula and use it for evil purposes.
and he was right.
ten years later, Kahuna was stronger...
...Smarter and faster than anyone else.
but he was stuck in the same little body.
he was like the Peter Pan of babies.
Hey, man, your brother gives everybody the creeps. He's a freak.
your brother is a regular teenage boy. Just like you.
you always stick up for him. -His life is hard.
what happened wasn't your brother's fault, it was mine.
you think he's so smart. Well, face it.
he's a freak! I can't even relate to this family.
I feel more German than I am American.
I should be with people who appreciate a normal kid!
his father worked so hard to develop an antidote for Kahuna's condition.
but unfortunately, he couldn't complete his work.
take what you were given, and make something good out of it.
all right?
you may forever have the body of a child, you know.
but you'll always have the heart of a hero.
I love you, Daddy.
although he was now 18 years old...
...Nobody believed it.
after six months in the orphanage, Kahuna realized his true destiny.
he would find a way to help all the orphans and children of the world.
so in the dark of the night, Kahuna slipped away.
and a legend was born.
Wow. -I'll say.
what about the serum he drinks from his bottle?
the stuff that turns him into a superbaby?
it's a natural formula which interacts with Kahuna's unique physiology.
Kahuna invented it himself. -Why?
he realized, long ago, that if a 2 foot tall superhero...
...Were to become the defender of the weak, he was gonna need an edge.
now, the whole trick here is just focus and visualize.
the only thing I can visualize is me falling on my butt.
I'm sorry. -It's okay.
what's this? -Don't know. Does it have a label?
I'm not sure.
it's got a microdot. Where'd you get this?
wait a second. When I bumped into that Crowe guy, Biscane's flunky...
...maybe it fell into the stroller. -Maybe.
it could be something. I'm gonna show it to Kahuna.
good idea.
Oh, by the way, what are you doing later?
I'm going home.
well, I just thought maybe, since you're leaving after lunch...
...that you and me, we could, you know...
...go have lunch up outside. -Like a picnic.
totally. Yes, like a picnic.
so 11: 30 behind the H?
Yeah, definitely. -Cool.
I've got a date!
great. Got a date.
my hair.
at least I got a cool pair of shoes.
I may not be much at this girlie stuff, but I think I can help her out.
I can help too. I'm very connected to my feminine side.
Hi. -Hey.
what?
what do you guys want? -Come, Kylie.
okay, okay, okay. I'm coming.
well, you wouldn't believe the help I had.
total wow.
you come up here a lot? -Yeah, I do.
try to imagine what's going on in each of the homes.
do they have kids, are they being tucked into bed for the night?
you miss her? Your mom, I mean.
well, don't get me wrong, living with Kahuna's been great.
I wouldn't give it up for anything in the world.
but, you know, I just wonder, you know.
what's that?
if you don't know what a kiss is, I must be doing this wrong.
no, that. -Oh, Kahuna.
Zack, the disk you and Kylie found?
the disk? -Yeah.
get down here right away. -The disk. Let's go.
see anything strange? -Besides a frog in a top hat?
I was talking about this. Looks like scrambled data.
what is that? -I think it's part of the puzzle.
technically, this activates a descrambler program.
similar to the ones used on TV cable boxes...
...to receive premium channels. -He is up to something.
whatever he's planning, it's going down at Bobbins' World...
...in 30 minutes. I wanna be there. -What about us?
Oh, no. I'm feeling nauseous again.
one day, Finkleman...
...You'll find courage where you least expect it.
Yeah. I was kind of hoping I'd finally get to smack somebody.
suit up, Zack. We're going in.
Hey, sweetie. -Hey, Finkie.
Hey, Maria. How you doing? -You okay?
you all right? -Miss me?
auntie Jean. -Hi.
Hey, Kahuna, you forgot this.
I didn't forget. I want you to hold on to it.
you'll understand why later.
take care, Arch. -Wow.
I missed you. -Hey, Archie.
uncle Stan. -Yeah.
come on. The show's gonna start.
ladies and gentlemen, the time has arrived.
the master is here, the champion of children everywhere.
you know him, you love him.
Mr. Bill Biscane.
thank you. Thank you. Thank you. The spectacle is at hand.
I'll let you all know when there is just 60 seconds left.
Kahuna is here.
and I guarantee, this will change the way you think about television, that is.
Zack, direct your helmet camera towards the satellite dish.
towards the dish.
hold it there, Zack.
that box is giving enough power to light up Times Square.
find anything?
Yeah, I think so. -Okay, cool.
are we ready? Let's count it down.
fifty-six now.
if this man wants to conquer the world, what better way than television?
that's it.
Zack, I think I figured it out.
there's code hidden in his transmissions.
I think it'll be used to broadcast the mind-altering signal to the kids.
if anything happens, look inside.
forty-one. -Okay, kid.
engage. Lift off.
look! There's Muggles!
Hello, Kahuna. I'm so happy to see you again.
I can't see. I can't see.
Where's Kahuna? -He's vanished.
it's all right, ladies and gentlemen.
after the spots clear...
...You'll realize it's just a special effect. A hologram.
there was no real child. There was no helicopter.
it was all just for your entertainment. You having fun?
get out of the way, kids!
I'm all right.
Vandals! Security!
Vandals! Security!
just in time. Arrest that man.
whoa, hey. What are you doing?
arresting you, officer. We'll start with destruction of private property.
we can explain. -I hope so.
what's going on? -It's Biscane.
there's some mind-control thing on the show.
next thing you know, she'll be saying that babies have a secret language.
but they do speak a secret language.
get my coat.
the babies stumbled on to something. So Kane destroyed Kahuna.
we will clean all this up and resume the premiere at 6: 00 sharp.
in the meantime, enjoy the refreshments.
wanna press charges? -No need to press charges.
you see, I am a generous and loving person.
you're a real bad, bad, bad, bad man.
I may not understand your language, but I know what you're thinking.
stay out of my way runt, or else.
will someone retrieve this unfortunate child?
coat.
he wouldn't just leave us. He's out there somewhere.
he'll come back when we need him.
what are we going to do without him?
don't worry. He'll be back.
I'll worry if I wanna worry.
there's never gonna be anyone like him. So brave, so powerful.
so tough. -Oh, man.
he was indeed one in a million.
to the 14th power. -I miss Kahuna.
and who's gonna save the children from Biscane now?
Yeah. -Well, it's your world now, Archie.
you know what? I'm just a baby.
a whiny, drooling diaper jockey.
I don't have the brains to come up with some super plan...
...like Kahuna.
I can kick some diaper, but I'm no Kahuna.
Kahuna.
Hey, kids, if you're watching this right now, things can't be good.
it means something has happened to me...
...and the children of the world are quite possibly in grave danger.
I can't tell you what to do next, but I can say this:
Archie, you believed there was a Kahuna when nobody else would.
now I'm asking all of you to take a leap of faith...
...and believe in something even more powerful than a superbaby.
what's more powerful than that? - Yourselves.
every child has power. All you have to do is believe.
all right, guys, I guess that's all there is to say.
whatever you decide...
...Good luck.
playtime is over. Kahuna's right.
we've gotta start believing in ourselves.
we're not just babies anymore.
we can be heroes.
I'm down. -Come on, Rosita.
you have more power than 10 boys put together.
you got that right. I'm in.
Finkleman, we can't do it without you.
put your hand on the rattle or deal with Rosita.
we've gotta work together as a team.
what do you say?
K for Kahuna!
kahuna, Kahuna, Kahuna.
so how does it feel to be in chains?
I designed them myself, by the way.
from a titanium alloy.
you've got way too much time on your hands, Kane.
I bet you don't know how we did our disappearing act.
you altered the decoder box...
...to reflect my laser beam right back at me.
you snatched me while everybody was seeing stars.
and you played right into it.
anyway, I foiled your plot to brainwash those babies.
you think that was my plot? That's always been your problem.
you are small, so you think small.
why should I waste my time with bedwetting babies...
...when I can control the minds of the entire world?
in just a few hours...
...all worldwide TV networks...
...will be switching from their satellites to my state-of-the-art...
...Telespace 3000. -So it's a mind-control pulse.
millions of couch potatoes will fill their minds...
...with nothing but the needs of Bill Biscane.
buying Biscane products, watching the Biscane satellite network.
investing their life savings in Biscane stocks.
all Biscane, all the time.
so it's true what they say.
there is nothing but junk on television.
you're just jealous because I'm winning this time. Me, me, me.
he's always pulling me down! -I know. He's a bully, sir.
this isn't over.
it will be at 6: 00.
enjoy your stay at my little child-care center.
I created it especially for you. Take him away.
is he gone?
who's your decorator, Spider-Man?
search him.
what can I tell you? Little boys like their toys.
I'll take a 10 a. m. wake-up call.
good night, sweet prince.
is that your secret with children, Dan?
did you actually communicate with the babies just like you said?
the babies are missing again.
what is going on around here? -I don't know.
did you see that? -See what?
you're not gonna believe this.
Hey, Archie, I got the keys. -Nice work, Alex.
okay, team, here we go.
Archie! -What on earth...
...do you kids think you're doing?
I have the Finklemans and Haley's mom ready to sue me...
...Over your first disappearing act. Now it's Grand Theft Auto?
it's not that simple.
before you say anything, just listen.
I tried to tell you before, but you didn't believe me.
bill Biscane is not the man you think he is.
he does have a mind-control pulse that he tried to use on the babies.
sometimes you need to trust your heart instead of your head.
Kylie's cool. -I really need your help.
the babies need your help. Kahuna needs your help.
we can't do it without you. -What's a Kahuna?
Hey, Garbot, over here. Over here. Over here.
activate laser scan.
I am active.
lots of people talked about world domination.
lots of people talked about world domination.
Caesar. Napoleon.
darth Vader.
darth Vader. But nobody's really pulled it off.
until now.
you truly are a great visionary.
sir, we're ready to initiate the universal uplink switch.
I'll take that off your hands.
don't bother. I'll show myself out.
hasta la vista, baby.
get him! Get him!
where? -There.
all right, wise guy, how you gonna get off this roof now?
keep your eye on the radar.
how many people are in this car? We couldn't get another vehicle?
Zack? Zack?
Holy-- -My thoughts exactly.
Zack.
Hey, what are you doing here? -The question is, what are you doing?
what's wrong? -The satellite receiver...
...is detecting a vehicle moving this way.
that's me, Zack. I'm coming in. We got visitors.
this Kahuna guy must be super. Would you look at this place?
you guys spent the night here?
Mr. and Mrs. Bobbins?
Hi. You guys might wanna get ready. We're about to have company.
followed by a small army of Biscane's men.
I think I've got a way to even the odds.
come on, guys. Come with me.
let's get into the lmagination Station.
we can become our superselves and help Kahuna.
Hello? We're outnumbered. -And we're outsized.
remember, you have to believe.
believe you can do anything you set your minds and hearts out to do.
Oh, no. I'm getting nauseous again.
right this way.
right this way. Is anyone listening to me?
he's here.
he's right here. Right in this doorway.
he's here. He's here. We found it. Prepare all units for a beach landing.
prepare units for a landing. -Single file.
single file.
so, Kahuna...
this is deja vu all over again.
I can't let you win. -You have no choice. You see?
I have my crack troops with me. Look. And reinforcements.
you haven't got a snowball's chance. This is it for you. It's over.
nice spot.
a little candy cane for my taste, but then, I am an adult.
I-- I am even a little sad that this must end.
you have been a formidable opponent.
Congratulations.
but this time, I am too many and too powerful.
and as always...
...you are all alone.
Kahuna is not alone. -Kahuna is not alone.
one of your little tricks? -Not alone.
not alone. -Not alone.
not alone. -Who is this...
...that stands with Kahuna against Bill Biscane?
it's me. -And me.
and me. A History of the Diaper Wars.
Hey.
me too.
and me. -And me.
and us.
all right, team!
well, as Genghis Khan once said:
"the more the merrier." I want the disk!
you want it? Come and get it.
I got it! -Charge! Take no prisoners!
now I'm excited.
all right, superbabies, let's see what you can do.
it's my turn!
why not freshen up a little?
all right, Fink! Major power move!
come on, get them! You are big soldiers. Do something!
there it is. Get the disk!
open your eyes. -It's mine!
it's mine!
there it is! That's it! Get it, get it!
boost me up! Boost me up!
you know, the old me would have knocked you boys senseless...
...with a right hook. But Cupid Girl would rather spread the love.
got you.
you can run, but you can't hide from Cupid Girl.
I love you, man.
give me a hug, you big lug. -Oh, no.
this is the worst news yet. Come on.
okay, Rosita! -Come on, they are babies!
get them, get them!
come on, they're babies. Get them, get them!
you don't have to say everything I say.
you don't have to say everything I say.
Yes!
I got it! -I got it! I got it!
nobody messes with my son.
that's it! This is the idea! -Hey!
that's my husband. -So?
right in the forbidden zone. -Oh, honey.
honey, are you okay? -That hurt a lot.
that disk belongs to me, girlie. -Who you calling girlie, sister?
Alex! -What's happening?
get that one. And that one. And that one. And that one.
do it! -You bet.
can a brother get some water? -Alex, you're sweating.
here.
must find the communication center. We're losing time, precious time.
that looks like the communication center.
Thanks, Kahuna.
get back to work.
that should keep them sleeping for a while.
got you.
all right, Brain Boy. You figured it out, huh, Brain Boy?
Yeah. -Give me five, Arch.
you stay here. No one must pass.
right. -No one.
Alex, you were great.
all right, honey. Archie, come over here!
we did it!
we did it!
Tascha. Tascha.
wake up. Wake up.
it's me. Up here. Billy. Bill Biscane.
the disk. Throw it up here.
come to papa. Come.
the disk!
I did it! I did it! I did it!
it's too late. It's too late.
thanks to the power of your own uplink...
...I can bounce the mind-control pulse off the satellite right from here. It's so convenient.
if I didn't hate you so much, I would thank you.
what happened back then wasn't my fault.
you don't have to keep hating me. -Don't flatter yourself.
you think I went to all this trouble because dad liked you best?
"dad"? -What are you talking about?
gee whiz, your little band of merry diaper men haven't figured it out yet?
Biscane here is Ken, my brother.
I should have been the one to get the superhero powers.
I should have stayed young forever. You took all that from me.
it's over. -You're wrong.
there's no fail-safe.
and this program will transmit a mind-control pulse no matter what.
the satellite can't be shut down, blown up or knocked off course.
Ken, one. Kahuna, zip.
how does it feel, after all these years, to be the one that is defeated?
how does it feel? Tell me. -lt feels bad.
Yeah, it feels bad. Feels really lousy, doesn't it? Good.
there. Now, was that so hard?
there's still one trick you haven't learned yet.
Really?
I'm about to become the most powerful man in the world.
enlighten me. What is it I have to learn?
how to make friends.
kids, now! -Go, go!
okay, kids. -Come on, kids!
go, go! Come on, let's go get him.
no bodily harm.
move, move! Move, move!
that's it! No bodily-- -one, two, three, four, five.
Bye-bye, Biscane. You're walking.
good Biscane ball bashing, Alex. -Options. I need them quick.
we can't abort the satellite feed.
there's no way to stop him? -Hey, Kahuna.
I've got the answer. -Well?
every day we get storytime. -Now's not a good time for baby talk.
I think I know what he's getting at. Go on, Archie.
every day we have storytime.
it can be either a bad book or a good book.
and we can't stop storytime.
but we can change the story from a bad one to a good one.
I can alter the mind-control message.
instead of being robbed of their free will, we just turn it around.
and crank up the free will.
no. No, no!
no, you'll ruin everything.
switch the mind-control message to freedom control.
they don't have to sit and watch TV all day.
will it work? -There's one way to find out.
all right, Archie, hit the switch. Now.
What're we watching this lame frog for?
he's boring.
let's go outside and play. -okay. Let's play tag. You're it.
we got it!
way to go, kids!
I may have lost the battle, but I will win the war.
I'll get this one!
not so fast, Billy.
that was pretty good. -Thank you.
that's my bad leg.
Oh, my God.
to realize the power of your true self, press this button.
this is how they became their superselves. It's time...
...for the real me to emerge.
here I come!
Oh, no.
I hate babies.
I hated being a baby. -Don't you worry, little Billy.
I'll feed you. I'll take care of you.
I'll even change your diaper.
I'm warning you, Crowe.
I'm Bill Biscane. If you touch my diapers, you're fired.
Oh, you dear boy. -Put me down. I can drool by myself.
put me down.
this has gotta be the most amazing day in history.
and you have a lot of explaining to do.
well, where do I start? -From the beginning.
you wanna hear the story?
okay, guys. It's time for me to pack up and move on.
maybe someday we could beat some bad guys up together...
...and then we'd get a chocolate shake after.
deep down we both know, kids, if that stroller leaves from here...
...and you're not on it, you'll regret it. Maybe not today...
...maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and for the rest of your lives.
you don't have to leave.
you don't have to go away. You can come live with us.
you know I can't do that.
why not? -Kid...
I wanna work side by side with my best friend, Kahuna.
we'll always be friends.
wait a second. None of this is making sense.
go back-- -Wait a minute.
is Kahuna leaving?
I'll tell you something, Arch, something I think you already know.
what's that? -You got a couple of real heroes...
...At home.
Yeah.
Yeah, I really do.
who's the big hero? -Daddy! I love you.
who's Daddy's little hero?
take care, my friends.
say, "Bye, Kahuna." -Bye.
Bye, Kahuna. -Bye, Kahuna.
I'm gonna miss you.
Bye, Kahuna.
the consumer report also stated that sales of children's books, music and toys have tripled since last month.
and the phenomenon continues.
for the second straight month, television ratings have plummeted.
children are spending more time outdoors, in sports, and reading.
elsewhere in the news, a busload of children in Mexico were saved...
... When their runaway school bus nearly plunged over a cliff.
while the trauma of the incident caused young witnesses...
... To claim some sort of superbaby saved the bus, experts believe...
... That atmospheric conditions... -Hey, buddy.
you miss him, don't you?
I'm the bogeyman. I'm the bogeyman. Bogeyman. Bogeyman.
you're the booger-man, you are.
Oh, that's not cool, Rosita.
Zack?
there's somebody here to see you.
are you my-- My mother?
mom, this is my friend, Kylie. -Hi.
Kylie, this is my...
my mother.
yay, Zack!
Kahuna.
Hey, Archie.
you're a full-fledged Junior Kahuna now.
that's official.
see you. -Look after everybody.
attention. Please prepare for docking procedure.
there's a package for you, Miss Perkins.
they didn't leave a name.
said it was important. - Thank you.
I don't like this business you're getting yourself into.
I'll be just fine, Mr. Paley. You know what a careful girl I am.
I move my mouth, words come out, you don't hear.
I'm late for a movie. - I don't like it when you smile at me.
you don't like my smile?
I don't like what's behind it.
listen, Polly, six scientists are missing, probably dead.
somebody out there means business. I don't want you in the middle of it.
it's only a movie, Mr. Paley.
I'll bring you some popcorn.
toto, I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.
we must be over the rainbow.
you sent me this?
who are you?
what's this all about, Mr...? - Doctor.
Dr. Walter Jennings. I'm a research chemist.
I specialize in nucleic-acid emissions.
the bonding enzymes in proteus molecules which
the missing scientists. You said you knew who was next.
Yes, l
I have a deadline to meet, doctor.
I was one of seven scientists chosen to serve in a secret facility stationed outside of Berlin before the start of the First World War.
it was known only as Einheit Elf, "Unit 11."
we agreed never to discuss what went on behind those doors.
the things we were made to do there...
terrible things.
I shouldn't have come. - Now I know we're not in Kansas.
are you a good witch or a bad witch?
doctor, you said you knew who was next.
Yes.
don't you see?
there is only one left. - Who? Who is it, doctor?
me.
he's coming for me.
who? Who's coming?
Totenkopf.
it's Totenkopf.

all citizens, attention.
new York City must be evacuated at once.

all members of the police and fire department on leave or off duty shall report immediately to their precincts or company command.
this is urgent.
editor Paley. - Mr. Paley, it's me, Polly.
what's going on? They're calling for midtown to evacuate.
listen, Mr. Paley, I don't have much time.
I need you to dig up anything you can on a Dr. Walter Jennings and someone named Totenkopf.
an address, a phone number, anything you can find. It's important.
Totenkopf. Who is he?
he may have something to do with the missing scientists.
quick as you can.
Polly, listen to me. I want you to get out of there.
I want you to put the phone down, close your notepad and get the hell out of there.
wait a minute.
I can see something now coming into sight above the Palisades.
they're crossing Sixth Avenue.
fifth Avenue.
they're a hundred -- They're a hundred yards away.
Polly. Polly!
Oh, my God.
Polly!
Polly!
Polly!
stop! Come back!

get out of here!
they've broken through the perimeter. Send reinforcements.
send everything you've got!

further details of the attack continue to pour in.
the central portion of the city is blacked out from radio communication due to damaged power lines and electrical failure.
cables received from English, French and German news agencies now confirm the attack was not limited to the city.
the BBC is reporting that a steel mill in Nuremberg was virtually excavated by what witnesses describe as a mechanized tornado.
news agencies in Paris and Madrid speak of strange burrowing machines rising from the ground, robbing entire communities of their coal and oil reserves.
meanwhile, with military resources stretched thin across the globe, world leaders must once again call upon the elite mercenary forces of Sky Captain and his army-for-hire to uncover the meaning of these mysterious events.
Where's Dex?
shazam.
I thought you said this thing was big. Can I have it?
you find out where it came from, and I'll buy you one for Christmas.
Oh, I need to show you something.
I recorded this signal just before the first machine appeared.
I didn't think anything of it until I played it back.
Morse code? - See, that's what I thought at first, but the syntax is more complex than that.
there's a sub-carrier hidden in the lower frequency.
I think it's being used to control them.
if it shows up again, could you track it?
I can try, yeah.
good boy, Dex. - Thanks.
in the meantime, see what you can do with that thing.
find out what makes it tick.
you don't mind, do you? - I don't mind.
I wanna know where it comes from, Dex. Who sent it here.
switch to map coordinate 69 SW by 49 E.
tummy ache?
how you been, Joe?
miss me? - Get out.
well, it's nice to see you too.
Dex said you might be in a mood.
Dex?
get in here!
it's been three years, Joe. You're not still mad at me, are you?
can't even remember what we were fighting about.
you sabotaged my plane.
right.
I spent six months in a Manchurian slave camp because of you.
they were gonna cut off my fingers. - Joe, for the last time, I didn't sabotage your damn airplane.
all so you could get a photograph of Tojo Hideki in his bathrobe, remember?
you know, I'm starting to think that you've invented this whole sabotage nonsense to cover the fact that you were running around on me with your little mystery girl the whole time we were in Nanjing.
never happened. All in your imagination.
who was she, Joe?
what was her name? - That's enough.
what are you gonna do?
shoot me?
it's been a pleasure, Polly.
let's do it again in ten years. Escort Miss Perkins off the base, Dex.
if she resists, shoot her.
Hi, Polly. - Hi, Dex.
I gotta... - It's okay, hon, I know.
okay.
it's just as well. I guess you wouldn't have been interested in this, anyway.
where did you get that? - There's more where this came from.
lots more.
I want that blueprint, Polly. - I want this story, Joe.
and you're gonna help me get it.
maybe we should show her, Cap. Maybe she can help.
show me what?
show me what?
my God. What is this?
where do they come from?
they started appearing three years ago in remote areas.
we managed to keep it a secret until now.
they show up without warning, they take what they need, and then they disappear without a trace.
three years and we still can't explain what they want or who's sending them here.
a man came to see me today, a scientist.
he was terrified. Said someone was coming for him.
I asked him who he was so afraid of, and he repeated one name:
Totenkopf.
he nearly went white when he said it.
Totenkopf, who is he?
he's the invisible man.
I've been through every library record twice looking for anything.
I've called every contact I have from Paris to Bangkok.
this is the only thing I could dig up.
he ran some kind of secret science unit outside of Berlin before the start of World War l.
something called Unit 11.
it's been more than 30 years since anyone has spoken his name.
until today.
note the insignia he used for the unit.
it matches the markings on all of these machines.
the scientist, where is he now?
we're in this together, right, Joe?
nothing gets published until I say so. You don't write a sentence or take a photograph without asking me first. Understood?
understood.
what?
I missed you.
thanks for saving my life today, by the way.
were you down there?
you missed me too. How nice.
this is it. This is Jennings' lab.
Dr. Jennings? It's Polly Perkins.
Dr. Jennings!
it's locked.
that window there.
I may be able to get in through that window if I can attach a line...
it's open.
we're too late. Someone beat us here.
all right, Polly...
...no more games. What the hell is going on?
I was hoping you could tell me.
Dr. Jennings!
you must stop him!
stay here.
stop!
I don't wanna hurt you.
miss Perkins. - I'm here, doctor.
I'm going to get you some help. - You must promise.
if Totenkopf finds them, the countdown will begin.
this world shall end. - I don't understand, doctor. Find what?
promise.
he's dead.
I think I found something.
Dr. Jennings had this with him this morning at the theater.
I'd better get back to the base. - I'm coming with you.
of course you are.
reconnaissance picked up something on radar traveling at over 500 knots and coming straight for us.
how long before they reach us? - There!
get my plane ready. I'm going up.
what are you doing? - I'm coming with you.
don't be stupid. Remember what happened last time you flew with me?
we had a deal. - This is not a game, Polly.
people are gonna die. - You are not leaving me, Joe.
not this time. This is my story, and we had a deal!
go, go, go!
get in.
there you are.
cap, this is Dex, do you read me? - Hang on, Dex, I'm a little busy.
come in, Dex.
look, whatever you do, don't shoot!
okay. - You shot it, didn't you?
Yes. - Listen, Cap, the signal's coming from one of those machines.
you gotta keep them in one piece.
which machine is it, Dex?
there's no way of telling. It could be any one of them.
I think I found it, Dex.
wait, Cap, I'm losing the signal. - It's heading for the city.
don't let it get away. I need you to bounce that signal back to me.
if we lose it now, we may never get it back.
you let me know when you've got something, Dex.
I'll let you know. Out.
all right, I want a full-spectrum sweep of every incoming signal.
amplify any variant frequency cycle and route them to me.
they've come back for the generators.
who is this guy?
you okay? - Great.
there's a bottle of Milk of Magnesia under the seat if you need it.
I'm fine. - You don't look so good.
pull up!
Joe! - I see it!
it's getting away.
I lost the signal, Cap. - I'll find him, Dex. Sit tight.
go left. - Sit back, Polly.
there's a shortcut down Broadway. You can catch him on 42nd Street.
I know these streets like the back of my hand. Go left!
Hey!
okay, okay, now go straight.
no, no, no, go right! - When?
back there.
I could use a little more warning next time.
go left!
tell me you got something, Dex.
we're getting clobbered up here.
it's no picnic down here either, Cap. Hang in there, I've almost got it.
Joe!
Dex! We can't hold them off any longer!
I'm almost there. - We have to evacuate now!
go ahead without me. I'm right behind you.
lovely. - Okay, turn left at the drugstore.
left again. - We're going around in circles.
will you just trust me? Go left!
it's a dead end. - That's not supposed to be there.
it's a dead end!
there's no way out!
Oh, bugger.
Joe!
there's the lead ship. - Shortcut!
I got us here, didn't l?
Dex. Dex! - Thirty seconds, Cap, that's all I need.
thirty seconds. - Plus or minus.
listen, I'll try and take them out over the water, buy us some time. Over.
still glad you came?
Joe, I found it! Joe!
Dex, come in. Where is it?
come in, Dex. Are you there? Dex?
Dex, do you read me?
Dex, are you there?
I can't outrun them much longer.
hold on.
Joe, what are you doing? You're heading straight down!
you're gonna kill us! - I know what I'm doing. Just hold on.
we're going too fast. We're not gonna make it.
Joe, you have to pull up!
pull up!
we went underwater. - Dex rigged it up.
got the idea from one of his comic books.
you mean, you knew this the whole time, and you let me think we were gonna crash?
I thought we were gonna die! You should have said something!
look, Polly, it was your idea to tag along, not mine.
if you can't take it, that's not my fault.
Oh, I can take it.
I can take anything you dish out. - Good.
because that was nothing.
Dex, come in. Do you read me?
do you read me, Dex? Copy.
Dex!
Dex!
Dex.
they're everywhere.
Joe, look out!
Dex!
why would Totenkopf do this?
why Dex? It doesn't make any sense.
he was looking for something.
Dex said he knew where the transmission was coming from.
he must have got too close.
he was trying to tell me something - Joe.
good boy, Dex.
these journals belong to Dr. Vargas.
he must have passed them on to Dr. Jennings before his disappearance.
my God. - What?
Totenkopf was awarded his first patent when he was 1 2 years old.
by 1 7, he had already received two doctorates and was one of the most highly regarded minds of his day.
one year after his disappearance, ominous rumors began circulating.
whispers that Totenkopf had begun work on what was darkly hinted to be a doomsday device.
efforts to locate him have consistently failed, and to this day, his whereabouts remain a mystery.
even less is known about his companion, an assassin who controls his machines.
she's the one who took Dex.
what else?
these are Unit 1 1 supply logs.
this is everything he's used his machines to collect for the last three years, including generators from the city.
it reads like a shopping list from all over the world.
what have you been up to, doctor?
it'll be all right, Joe. Dex can look after himself.
we'll find him.
my old friend Joe.
so glad to see you again. - It's good to see you too, Kaji.
so glad to see you again. - It's good to see you too, Kaji.
this is Polly Perkins. She'll be coming with us.
nice to meet you.
Kaji, did you get the maps I needed? - Yeah, they're inside.
did you get a little something for me?
of course. Three cases, just like you asked.
Vienna sausages. My God, it's been so long.
Kaji, how's your Tibetan?
come, I'll show you the maps.
how well do you know him? - Kaji?
he's old legion. Reconnaissance. Why?
I don't trust him.
that's funny, he said the same thing about you.
here. Get changed. Your clothes stay behind.
you won't be needing high heels where we're going.
Dex tracked the signal to here, this valley north of Karakal.
this is where the transmission originated.
why is there no writing here? What is this place?
Shambhala. - You know it?
it is forbidden.
it's said to be the source of the Kalachakra, Tibetan magic.
those who live there are said to have supernatural powers.
you can get us there, Kaji, can't you?
no one has ventured this far. It's very dangerous.
Shambhala is said to be protected by the priests of the Kalachakra lamasery.
if they find us there, they will kill us.
Why? Why is this place so special?
Shambhala is known by many names. To the Hebrew, it is Eden.
to the ancient Greek, it was Empurios.
you may know it as Shangri-la.
a storm is coming. If you still wish to go, we must go now.
I need to send a message.
editor Paley, this may be the last message you receive from me.
we've tracked a radio signal to Nepal in search of Dr. Totenkopf.
the story grows stranger at every turn.
clues about a countdown. But to what, I don't know.
I fear time is running out.
with any luck, I'll be back soon with Dex and the story.
I hope. Polly Perkins.
this is where civilization stops.
a blank on the map.
we must be careful from here.
hurry.
what is it?
it looks like a mining outpost.
something bad happened here.
seems to be abandoned.
tell your men we're heading down.
I want a closer look.
what is it, Joe?
uranium.
the whole mine's contaminated.
we can't stay here. - Let's go.
Where's Polly?
Polly!
miss Perkins?
we'll have to split up.
Polly!
let her go.
give me the vials and the girl will live.
what vials? What are you talking about?
I will not ask a second time.
drop the gun.
I told you, I don't know what you're talking about. You'll just have to kill us.
as you wish.
wait! Wait. Wait.
I'm sorry, Joe.
goodbye, my friends. Your journey ends here.
I was going to tell you, Joe. You have to believe me.
what was in those vials? - I don't know.
you expect me to believe that? - I'm telling the truth, Joe.
Dr. Jennings gave them to me just before he died.
he said that the world would end and the countdown would begin if Totenkopf got his hands on them.
you've done nothing but lie to me from the beginning.
okay, I'm a liar. But I don't exaggerate. That is what he said.
that was what Totenkopf was looking for.
that's why he took Dex. - I'm sorry.
I never meant for any of this to happen.
do you hear that?
dynamite.
that noise again.
move!
what are you doing?
come on!
Oh, great.
we're safe.
Polly, this may be our last moment together.
there's something I need to ask you.
Yes, Joe?
did you cut my fuel line?
damn it! I didn't sabotage your lousy airplane!
our last moments on earth and this is all you have to say to me?
could we just for once die without all this bickering?
there you are.
why did you lock the door? - Run!
my film.
Polly, leave it! There's no time!
Polly.
Polly.
my clothes.
what are you doing in here? Get out. Get out!
not unless you have some pants hidden under there for me.
Oh, don't tell me you're - Naked.
you can say it, Polly. - This isn't funny, Joe.
where are we? What happened to us? Where are our clothes?
stop looking at me like that.
like what?
turn around, Joe.
I'm serious. Turn around.
Hi, Joe.
ask him what he did with our clothes.
the clothes are burned.
burned? Why?
he says the mine is poisonous.
our clothes were infected.
he says he's arranged for a guide to lead us back down the mountain.
he will take us there once we are dressed.
we appreciate that. But explain to him we are here to find a man.
he says we must leave before it is dark.
there's nothing more he can do for us.
it's very important we find this man.
his name is Totenkopf!
he says, what do you want with this man?
I've come to kill him.
and to find my friend.
he says he will help you.
what do you think?
I think they burned the wrong clothes.
you said I couldn't bring anything else.
I think you look like a woolly mammoth.
they're waiting for us.
the priest says that Totenkopf enslaved his people, made them work in the mine, but the mine was poisonous.
those who did not die right away were brought here for him to study.
where is Totenkopf now?
he does not know. Only that Totenkopf is gone, many years ago.
I can't believe this is happening.
I only have two shots left.
we're in Shangri-la and all I have is two shots.
everything I had was in that bag.
you should have let me go back for my film.
you're right, I should have.
so where's he taking us?
to meet the only living survivor of Totenkopf's experiments.
what experiments?
ask him, where is Totenkopf? Tell him it's important we find him.
he wants to know why. Why do you seek Totenkopf?
to make him pay for what he has done.
his staff. He's asking for his staff.
he says, follow Rana. The staff will lead you there to Totenkopf.
Rana? Is there such a place?
he says now that he has helped you, you must help him.
of course. Anything.
what do you want?
kill me.
have you looked at this? There's markings on it, like a ruler.
and there's a moon and a star.
and all I ask is a tall ship and a star to steer her by.
a star.
he wasn't talking about a place, he was talking about a star!
rana is a star.
ancient sailors used to navigate by using the night sky.
they could determine their position by the moon and the stars.
the Vikings were known to create maps for certain stars,
the Vikings were known to create maps for certain stars,
latitude tables that required a key to decipher them.
the key was called Jacob's staff. This has to be the key!
you mean this could really work?
you could really find Totenkopf with this thing?
we do things a little different nowadays.
all we needed to know was where to look. What's the date?
march 2. - March 2.
using Karakal Plateau as our assumed position...
march 2...
rana is at latitude 20. 40.
right ascension, 03 hours, 43 minutes.
Declination, minus 10. 60.
there's nothing there.
are you sure you did it right?
I'm sure.
if the old man was right, that's where Totenkopf is now.
dead center in the middle of nowhere.
what's that point there?
that's where we run out of fuel.
Oh, great.
so how do we get there?
Franky. - Who?
Frank Cook. An old buddy of mine.
runs a mobile reconnaissance outpost for the Royal Navy.
if I can get a message to them,
I may be able to arrange a rendezvous at these coordinates.
and what if they don't get the message?
franky's never let me down. They'll be there.
they'll be there.
is that light supposed to be on?
relax, Polly, everything's fine.
we're out of fuel, aren't we? - Buckle up.
manta Station, do you read me?
where are you, Franky?
what are you doing?
you can't land this in the middle of nowhere.
I'm not. I'm landing it on that.
what is it? - It's a mobile airstrip.
Dex had a hand in designing it.
it's kind of a secret. You can keep a secret, can't you, Polly?
Yeah.
I can keep a secret.
two shots.
permission to land on platform 327. Maintain your present course.
copy, 327.
welcome aboard, captain.
joseph Sullivan. I was sure you'd be dead by now.
it's good to see you too, Franky.
this had better be important or one of us is in trouble.
it's important.
what is that?
you be nice.
commander Cook, meet Polly Perkins.
Polly Perkins. I've heard so much about you.
it's a pleasure to finally meet the competition.
it's been a long time since Nanjing, hasn't it, Joseph?
so, Franky, I hear you've been having trouble with that number-three engine, or at least you were last time
commander, we're tracking six enemy submersibles bearing 30 degrees northwest.
who wants to kill you now? - Man your battle stations.
all hands on deck. - Follow me.
take us to 1 0, 000 feet and deploy countermeasures.
Yes, commander.
reconnaissance located an island 3 kilometers northeast of our current position.
it is not, however, on any of our charts.
that has to be him. - That has to be who?
what have you got me into this time, Joseph?
nothing you can't handle, Franky.
Polly, try not to touch anything.
enemy warships bearing 316, mark 4. Closing fast.
give me a visual. - Launching radio imager.
we're receiving a signal. On-screen now.
Totenkopf.
commander, we've lost power to the forward rotors. We're losing altitude.
all engines, reverse full. Get us out of here.
francesca, you've got to get me on that island.
I'm not about to risk the lives of my men for one of your silly antics.
he's got Dex.
rescind order!
you'll never make it from the air. We have to find you another way.
there's a tidal flow on the eastern face of the island.
it's too deep. We're not rated past 300 meters.
but...
...this area here, there's an undersea inlet at the southern tip and it runs beneath the entire length of the island. That is your only way in.
everything else is sheer rock to the edge of the water.
what about those machines? How do we get past them?
leave that to me.
alert the amphibious squadron.
report to main station carrier.
what?
Nanjing?
I can't hear you, Polly.
you'll have to speak up.
keep your nose up, Joseph. You always were bad at the short takeoff.
keep up, Franky. I don't wanna have to come back for you.
I thought your takeoff was just fine.
thank you, Polly.
so you heard that, did you?
manta leader to Manta team, impact in ten seconds.
switching to amphibious mode.
impact in five, four, three,
Franky.
you remember our milk run over Shanghai, don't you?
we had the target buttoned up and he was jinxing in the flak.
pops a rivet, thinks he's taken a hit. - And started yelling:
protect the rabbits! - Protect the rabbits!
protect the rabbits!" - Protect the rabbits!
enemy target spotted four points to the right. Depth, 1, 600. Look sharp.
Joe, watch out!
Joseph, there's the inlet. - I see it.
get ready to make a run for it. We're about to clear you a path.
hold on, now, Polly. Hold on.
manta leader to Manta team, arm cluster torpedoes and stick close to element formation.
fire.
Joseph! Pull up!
Joseph, it's still alive. Disengage.
do you hear me? Disengage.
do you hear me?
what is it? - Do you hear me? Pull up!
the rudder's jammed. I can't steer. - Joseph!
Disengage!
thank you, Franky. That was close. - Get ready to make a run for it.
you're only going to have one shot at this.
Franky, what are you doing? This is no time to show off.
she's heading straight for it. - On my mark.
she's going to ram it. - It's suicide.
Franky, pull up.
three. - Pull up, Franky.
you're all clear.
good luck, Joe.
thank you, Franky. We'll take it from here.
she's some kind of girl.
Yes, I know.
I'm taking us up.
what?
what is it? - One of Totenkopf's creatures.
you're not gonna photograph that? - I've only got two shots left.
who knows what's waiting for us out there.
suit yourself.
there's a clearing up ahead. Totenkopf can't be far.
run.
there.
Polly!
Oh, great.
come on!
Polly!
come on!
are you mad?
are you mad?
are you completely insane? You could have gotten yourself killed!
it's okay. - No, it isn't.
I didn't mean-- - I shot the ground!
what? - When we were running,
I shot the ground.
it isn't funny.
I only have one shot left. One shot!
what is it with you and that stupid camera, anyway?
you gave it to me.
you don't even remember, do you?
you were flying with the American volunteers in Nanjing,
I was covering the evacuation of Shanghai.
I remember. - Joe, I wanna ask you something and I want you to tell me the truth.
I don't care one way or the other, I swear. I just need to know.
the girl in Nanjing was Franky, wasn't it?
Polly. - How long were you seeing her?
look me in the eyes.
I never fooled around on you.
never.
I sabotaged your plane.
three months. - I knew it!
I can't believe I ever trusted you, you lousy
he's here.
you all right?
through there.
through there.
my God, Joe.
it's an ark.
he's building an ark.
what are you doing?
you honestly think you're gonna find something more important than every single creature on Earth being led two by two inside a giant rocket ship?
I might.
like what? - I'll know when I see it.
ten minutes to liftoff. - They've started the countdown.
we have to find Totenkopf.
you've got a gift.
Dex! - Hurry, get in!
Komm, springt!
are you all right? How did you find us?
we escaped into the tunnels once the countdown started.
some of the scientists were caught. They didn't make it.
the machines that were guarding us are loading everything on this island into that ship.
we've got about ten minutes to stop that thing from blasting off.
Dex! Get us out of here!
good boy, Dex.
Thanks, Cap.
who are they? - They're Unit 11.
or what's left of them.
they were brought here to finish what they started 30 years ago.
finish what?
tell them.
Totenkopf believed that humankind was doomed to extinction, so he proposed the unthinkable:
to build a vessel that would carry the building blocks of a new civilization into space.
he used his machines to collect specimens representing all life on Earth.
what Totenkopf called "The World of Tomorrow."
those vials that Dr. Jennings gave me, what were they?
Adam and Eve. Totenkopf's masterpiece.
seeds of a technological utopia.
we smuggled them off this island, knowing Totenkopf would never leave without them.
but now that he has them again, there is nothing left to keep him here.
then let him go. Let him go where he can't harm anyone.
no, no, no, that ship must never leave this Earth.
Why? What haven't you told us?
when the rocket reaches 100 kilometers, at the edge of space, - Earth will be incinerated. - How do we stop it?
only Totenkopf can stop it now. But we've never been allowed near him.
he's too well guarded even to be seen.
where is he? - We're on our way, Cap.
good boy, Dex.
careful. Careful.
hurry, they'll be coming for us.
through there. That's the only way in.
you see, there is no way past them.
five minutes, Joe.
wait here. - You'll be killed.
he knows what he's doing.
I think.
Hey, that's my gun!
Dex? - Try shaking it.
we must hurry. - Don't do it, you idiot!
doctor, stop!
who dares come before me?
who dares enter this place?
what has begun cannot be stopped.
the time for this world is over. - Totenkopf.
Hello, doctor.
why are you doing this?
I have been witness to a world consumed by hatred and bent on self-destruction.
watched as we have taken what was to be a paradise and failed in our responsibilities as its steward.
I know now that the course the human race has set for itself cannot be changed.
I am the last, desperate chance for a doomed planet.
now, leave this place or die!
is it safe? - Well, there's only one way to find out.
I meant throw something.
he's not here.
we're too late.
these are his personal papers.
he would never leave without them. He must still be here.
we must find him. - I found him.
it's impossible.
it can't be.
the last entry in his journal was made on October 11, 1918.
he died over 20 years ago.
we've been chasing a ghost.
three minutes to liftoff.
they never stopped. They're finishing what they were programmed to do.
don't you see? This entire island is Totenkopf. Every wire, every gear.
he's found a way to cheat even his own death.
so how do we kill somebody who's already dead?
how do I stop it? - Nothing can stop it now.
there must be some way. - His machines would never allow it.
leave the machines to me. Dex, show me what to do.
if you can cut the lead in the system terminal, it should create a short...
...which will ignite the fuel line before the booster engines can fire - and destroy the atmosphere. - That's it?
that's all I have to do? - The terminal's on board the rocket.
you won't have time to escape.
contact Franky as soon as you're off the island.
she'll know exactly what to do. - What are you talking about?
I'm going with you. - Not this time.
we had a deal.
you're not gonna leave me now, just when things are getting interesting.
and I only hope, one day, you can forgive me.
take care of her, Dex. - Good luck, Cap.
one minute to liftoff.
we meet again, my mysterious friend.
how do you wanna do this?
nice shot, Polly.
what took you so long?
she's a machine.
ten seconds to liftoff.
we've gotta get those animals off the ship.
ninety kilometers to booster ignition.
there's no time.
that's our only way across.
eighty kilometers to booster ignition.
danger! Danger! Danger! Cargo release imminent!
what did you do now?
come on!
seventy kilometers to booster ignition.
sixty kilometers to booster ignition.
hold on!
please! Don't touch anything else!
there's no time. We'll never make it.
fifty kilometers to booster ignition.
run!
forty kilometers to booster ignition.
come in, Manta station. Do you read me?
thirty kilometers to booster ignition.
Franky, it's Dex. Do you read me?
it didn't work.
twenty kilometers to booster ignition.
Joe, you're running out of time. You've gotta do something.
and God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth...
he thinks he's God. - And God said unto Noah, the end...
shut up!
ten kilometers to booster ignition.
...six... - Why won't you die?
five kilometers to booster ignition.
would you excuse me for a moment?
hurry back.
I have the package in sight.
Sarah, can you hear me?
authorized PERSONNEL ONLY...
VRULT...
Where's Mike Traceur?
we can do this the easy way...
or the very, very hard way.
Yes, Michael?
Sarah's not responding.
my sensors have picked up Sarah.
she is in the vault room.
you are not in the vault room with her.
Yeah, I got hung up.
Michael, you have less than two minutes to make contact, acquire the package, and retrieve the files.
not a problem.
the ambassador's gonna be more than a little upset by your treatment of his guests.
Sarah has been joined by four men, and they are armed.
guys, what are we doing?
Oh, come on, really?
Kitt, get me to Sarah now.
take the staircase on your left for the fastest route to Sarah.
keep your eyes peeled, KITT.
Michael, I do not have eyes.
it's a figure of speech.
which floor? - Basement level.
Michael, security has discovered the loop I have programmed into their surveillance system.
they are moments away from detecting the source of my tap.
I'm moving as fast as I can.
you would probably move faster if you ate a healthy diet, decreased your alcohol intake, and reduced the extracurricular activity with your lady friends.
I might as well be dead.
your death will not help Sarah in her current situation.
Where's the package?
I have lost contact with the package.
it appears to have vanished.
I have detected a co-opt of the consulate security system.
it appears the men with Sarah may have a plan similar to ours.
do we know who they are? - Negative, Michael.
do they have the package?
it does not appear so.
their weapons indicate they are not consulate guards.
if they don't have the package, then they're after the files.
Michael, Sarah has the files.
I know. That means they have Sarah.
you must have a very high opinion of Mike Traceur if you're willing to risk the amount of pain I'm about to inflict upon you.
he would do the same for me.
you have no idea who he is, do you?
Michael, Sarah's heart rate and respiration have suddenly increased.
they are rising rapidly.
last chance.
Where's Mike Traceur?
Michael, you have turned the wrong way.
right, not left.
you said left.
no, Michael, I said left, left, right, left, right, left.
dude, you're confusing me! - Please remain calm.
I am calm!
my surveillance tap has been detected.
security knows we are here.
go, go, go!
there are consulate guards moving in on you from every direction.
and two armed men outside the vault room.
a little late, KITT.
stay where you are.
Michael, I am being detained.
Hey, well, get undetained.
Hey, guys.
do you know where the bathroom is? 'Cause I gotta pee.
please step away from the car, or I will be forced to take defensive measures.
dude, the car's talking to us.
big deal. My car talks to me. It's called GPS.
Yes, but can your car do this?
Michael, Sarah is in distress.
check the door.
I see you still have your reflexes, traceur.
who the hell are you?
I hate needles.
what was that for?
cause I thought I was gonna die.
Kitt, where are you? - But...
I am almost at your location, Sarah, but I have attracted me so attention.
I suggest you and Michael get to the rendezvous point as quickly as possible.
come on.
the guy with the syringe kept asking for Mike Traceur.
they weren't after the files?
no, no, I've got the files.
they were after you.
clear.
give me your hand.
Kitt, there's no time for you to stop.
now would be a good time to use the new program I uploaded.
wait, what new program?
that one.
how did he do that?
Mike, you really should pay attention in the briefings.
Sarah is right, Michael. You should.
prepare for transformation.
transformation complete. Occupant restraint system active.
Kitt, were you able to identify the men in the vault room?
I was not, Sarah.
whoever they were, they were very good at getting in and getting out without being seen.
what about the package?
my sensors are unable to penetrate to that depth, but the only way out undetected is through one of the underground passageways beneath the consulate.
you lost the package?
lost is such a harsh word.
Michael, Sarah, we have a problem.
what kind of problem?
that kind of problem.
impact in 30 seconds.
deploy flares. - 29...
Kitt, stop the countdown and deploy the damn flares.
Michael, deploying flares-- - KITT, deploy the flares!
deploying flares.
flares are ineffective, Michael.
as I was trying to tell you, I cooled my heat signature to ambient air temperature.
the missile is not homing in on me, Michael.
it is homing in on you.
what do you want me to do, get out?
that would be a fatal error, Michael.
my sensors indicate something unusual about this warhead.
I may not be programmed to respond correctly.
what does he mean "respond correctly"?
please remain calm.
I have relayed our situation to dr. Graiman.
I am certain he is working on a solution as we speak.
emergency. Missile is locked on target.
knight...
there is no solution.
missile impact in 20 seconds.
this just got interesting.
prepare for impact. - 3, 2, 1...
Kitt, it's getting hot in here.
Kitt diverted just enough power at exactly the right moment to withstand that missile.
he's learning.
just like he's supposed to.
the explosive material in the missile has attached itself to my outer skin.
shed it. - I cannot.
analyze it.
I appears to be an advanced form of napalm with chemical attributes similar to that of rocket fuel.
how do we put it out?
we do not. We have to wait for it to burn out.
Kitt, the chances of Mike and I surviving the rising temperature
are 1 in 997, 000.
that is so not good.
I have diverted 60% of my power to cooling, but I am afraid it is not as effective as I had hoped.
worst case scenario, KITT?
when the temperature reaches 212 degrees, you will be boiled alive in your own bodily fluids.
best case scenario?
you will be unconscious before it happens.
we need the files they retrieved.
look, this isn't a zip drive, alex.
those are massive encrypted files.
now uploading now would drain the power from the systems keeping Sarah and Mike alive.
they lost the package, Charles.
if it falls into the wrong hands, every file we have will be compromised, including the list of our undercover operatives.
if we lose the files too-- - that's my daughter in there.
I know, Charles. I know.
but they have to upload the files.
open a line to Sarah.
Zoe, get me a secure line with israeli intelligence.
Alex...
dad.
Sarah, we need you to upload the files.
Drmagrain, diverting even the smallest amount erof pow at this time will cause a substantial increase in internal temperature.
Kitt, turn off all unnecessary systems.
Billy, figure out how to put out this damn fire.
initiating simulation.
initiating simulation.
Oh, god, don't get any ideas.
me? You're the one who just locked lips.
it was the heat of the moment, Mike.
I suggest you take off your clothes.
okay.
our bodies can't withstand the excessive temperature.
you're right.
Sarah is correct, Michael.
removing your clothes will reduce your core temperature, thereby delaying your death.
Michael, please be careful as you disrobe.
your arm is coming perilously close to the window control.
if you open the window, you will both be tly stanincinerated.
like I'm trying to get us killed.
I suggest you both refrain from speaking unnecessarily as your oxen supply is running low.
oxygen supply at 50%.
fire neutralizing.
simulation complete.
Billy, what do you got?
we need KITT to increase his speed.
if he hits 377 miles per hour, the fire will be neutralized.
how close are gonna cut it?
within seconds of their lives.
Kitt, you need to increase your speed.
increasing my speed while uploading the encrypted files will drain power necessary to keep Sarah and Michael alive.
Yeah, not a good idea.
Billy has a plan.
thanks for the vote of confidence.
sure hope it works, because if it doesn'T...
we've never hit speeds that high before, even in attack mode.
oxygen supply at 20%.
it shoulda worked.
Billy, it's not working.
it should've worked, unless
unless the chemical compound is fusing with KITT's bio material, causing a molecular reassembly.
bring 'em in hot.
that fire gets close to the weapons room, we're all dead.
if we bring 'em in in the middle of an uncontrollable molecular reassembly, we're worse than dead.
we'll bring 'em into the tunnel.
we'll shut the emergency doors, suck out all the air.
without oxygen, the fire can't breathe.
without oxygen, they can't breathe either.
Kitt, we're bringing you in hot.
affirmative, dr. Graiman.
Dr. Graiman, Michael and Sarah have lost consciousness.
how close are they?
Kitt's current speed, they'll be in the tunnel in 15 seconds.
put medical and fire teams on alert.
all medical and fire personnel report to the ssc immediately.
Dr. Graiman, as fbi agent in charge, I cannot allow you to bypass security protocol.
then Sarah and Michael die.
Carrrrie, we don't have time for this. Please.
bypass security protocol alpha delta 5-7-3.
security bypassed.
emergency hangar doors open.
re-entry unstable.
emergency procedures in effect.
warning.
molecular reassembly in progress.
excessive heat.
Dr. Graiman, Michael and Sarah have no oxygen.
please open the door.
Billy, there's no oxygen in that tunnel.
you need to open the doors now.
working on it.
we do not have time for you to work on it, Billy.
michael and Sarah will die without oxygen immediately.
I am coming in. Please open the door.
molecular reassembly halted.
impact imminent.
Billy, open the damn doors!
I can't override the emergency system.
Billy, if the door's not opened immediately, I will crash into it.
impact averted.
oxygen supply
moving in.
let's cool it off first.
that was awesome.
Zoe, I believe that "awesome" is not the appropriate word for this situation.
deep breaths.
Kitt, are you okay?
I am fine, Sarah. Are you okay?
I was worried about you and Michael.
you were worried about us?
Yes.
you're a computer, KITT. You can't worry.
artificial intelligence, Michael.
there is a difference.
I have run it through my database several times.
I believe "worry" is the appropriate word.
can I get some clothes here?
I'm fine. I'm fine.
I'm okay.
are you all right? How do you feel?
not too fast. - I got it. I got it.
you all right?
Yeah. - I'm fine. Come on.
Billy, once I complete my system diagnostics,
I will point out where you went wrong in your calculations.
thank you, KITT.
owned.
listen, zoe, I have advanced degrees in applied physics, quantum physics, electrical and mechanical engineering, chemistry, as well as discrete and applied mathematics.
and I speak nine languages.
we should make a baby.
Really? - No.
the mission was compromised.
the mission was compromised because you hit on every woman in the consulate.
I was undercover.
as what, a pimp?
four men were waiting in the vault room and they asked for me by name.
who were they? - I have no idea.
they weren't after the package or the files, but they knew I would be there.
are you implying that we have a leak?
they knew exactly when we'd be there.
don't go there, Mike.
the fbi's here to protect-- - do not tell me how to do my job!
then do your damn job, carrie.
Sarah almost died.
Sarah was trained just like everyone else.
I don't want her in the field anymore. It's too dangerous.
not your call.
we'll do the rest of KITT's repairs on the plane.
just got word the package is on the move.
yeah? Well, I thought maybe I'd grab a beer.
replenish some of those fluids I lost from almost boiling to death.
you lost the package, Mike.
wheels up in 15 minutes.
we have a problem with Mike.
what kind of problem?
take care of it.
Hello, Michael.
sorry, I didn't know you were in here.
it's okay.
it's not like you haven't seen it before.
those men from the vault room.
they know you from iraq, don't they?
they didn't have very flattering things to say about you.
Sarah, there are thingsthat I don't remember.
you don't remember?
or you don't want to remember?
lieutenant traceur!
you can't keep it all bottled up, Mike.
I'm just... - it's just what?
what are you afraid of?
what you did...
or what you're capable of doing?
both.
top secret clearance only
so where's the package?
washington D. C.
Sarah programmed the locator coordinates provided by israeli intelligence into KITT.
get the package and get back to the plane asap.
and how do I know someone won't be waiting there to kill me?
you don'T.
great.
Kitt, you sure you don't have anything on the men from the vault room?
as I told Sarah at the time, whoever they were, they were very good at getting in and getting out without being seen.
Yeah, like they knew exactly where they were going.
there is no evidence of a leak, Michael.
well, something's going on.
to alleviate your concern,
I will check the files of everyone working in knight industries' research and development department.
wait a minute, KITT. What are you saying?
the two people directly responsible for the safety and security of this project are the obvious suspects if our missions are being compromised.
no way.
just because they are your friends does not mean they are not capable of deceit.
the data I am accessing suggests that it is a very common human trait.
many high level government officials use deceit on a daily basis and still remain in office.
most of Alex Torres' files are classified, indicating he may have something to hide.
Kitt, I have classified files.
are you hiding something, Michael?
may I ask you a question?
that depends on the question.
what exactly is your relationship with Sarah?
you dated before you joined the military, and you obviously still care deeply for her.
Sarah and i are just friends, KITT.
then why do your hormone levels rise when you are around each other?
I have also detected a release of pheromones and other signs ofl exuaarousal.
whoa, KITT!
way too personal.
I wish you wouldn't do that.
we have arrived at the location of the package.
my scanners are picking up a man hiding under the bridge, and there is no sign of the package.
please be careful, Michael.
don't move.
please don't shoot.
turn around.
Where'the package?
I'm the package.
well, not all of me. Just some of me.
let's get out of here.
come on.
what did you expect, a briefcase full of plutonium?
Yeah, kind of.
Michael, a car is rapidly approaching.
Oh, my god.
it is you.
I'm sorry. Do I know you?
you know me all right.
no te recuerdas?
get in the car now!
you remember me now?
only reason why I don't kill you is 'cause I owe you.
consider us even.
okay, papito?
why'd she call him "papito"?
what does that mean?
tiny father, but that's not how she said it.
that was sexual. More like,"who's your daddy"?
you really do not know who this woman is?
never seen her before in my life.
but you have the same tattoo.
it's a military tattoo.
a lot of people who served in special forces have them.
there is nothing in any known database on her.
cross-reference her with the men from the consulate last night.
I still do not have enough information to identify the men at the consulate.
she's the second person I've never met in the last eight hours who claims they know me.
Kitt, cross-reference her with me.
Michael, even with my clearance, I cannot access your classified military files.
stop.
Where's this footage from?
beirut, lebanon.
I've never been to beirut.
the footage does not appear to have been altered.
I believe you, or someone who looks just like you, was in beirut with this woman on the date indicated.
something's not right.
Billy, open a chat line.
who the hell is she?
looks like we got us a little tongue action.
muy caliente!
ixnay on the surveillance footage-A.
Michael, why are you speaking pig latin incorrectly?
just turn it off, please.
I have no idea who she is.
the package is vital to national security, Mike.
get it back.
Yes, sir.
Kitt, I need to speak with Sarah in private.
michael needs to talk to you. please go to pod room for a secure line hello, Sarah.
cut the music.
Sarah, after i shipped out to iraq, when I stopped calling you, did I give you a reason why?
you remember that you stopped calling, but you don't remember why?
no.
all right, then...
let me jar your memory for you, Mike.
you called me from a classified location.
you wouldn't say where.
you asked me to marry you.
and I said yes.
and then you disappeared for three years.
I thought you were dead.
I asked you to marry me?
and the day you asked me is the same date that's on the surveillance footage of you in beirut.
Sarah, I have never been to beirut.
what's going on, Mike?
I gotta go.
it is possible something traumatic happened and you are repressing your memories, or you have dissociative identity disorder, also known as multiple personality disorder.
or someone doesn't want me to remember.
in re-examining your military files, I find that there are many gaps.
you seem to have disappeared for weeks, sometimes months, at a time.
Mike, did you have anything to do with an operation secure freedom?
operation secure freedom is one of your many files I was denied access to, Michael.
the men at the consulate who tried to kill you were all involved in the same black op.
you okay?
dad, something's wrong with Mike.
what are you talking about?
something happened to him in iraq.
things happen in war, Sarah.
things men don't want to talk about.
no, something else.
something different.
something very bad.
Michael, why did you disconnect agent rivai?
Kitt, I need to see inside that car.
I believe you are either repressing your memories or you are not being honest about them.
Kitt, when humans keep changing the subject, that means they don't want to talk about it.
there are some things I remember and some things I don'T.
but right now, I need to see inside that car.
using the signal from her gps, I may be able to track and follow her using real-time satellite surveillance.
can you zoom in and enhance?
boost and redirect your parabolic mics.
boosting and redirecting.
you shaved your head?
my entire body.
a single strand of my hair is worth millions.
look, fake eyebrows and eyelashes.
I also exfoliate every four hours, so there's no way you can get a sample.
wanna bet?
what are you doing?
did she just chop off his thumb?
it appears she did.
Oh, I think I'm gonna hurl.
Yep.
no, No, Hey.
gotta get my thumb back. - Come on, come on.
we gotta get my thumb back.
Mike, you have to get his thumb back at all costs.
Kitt, plot an intercept.
intercept plotted.
we're gonna need a little first aid.
accessing first aid data.
Hey, what are you doing?
I think I'm gonna pass out.
Really? - Yeah.
awesome.
what the
first aid complete.
for a follow up, please see your personal physician within the next 24 hours.
it doesn't hurt anymore.
can the people you're talking to hear and see everything inside this car?
Yes.
Kitt, shut off all contact with the ssc.
but, Michael-- - just do it.
going offline.
get audio and visual back up.
there's no way to override.
that would defeat the purpose of artificial intelligence.
okay, they can't hear or see us, and please don't tell me you know me.
no, but I know the people you work for, and they are gonna dissect me then put me under a microscope.
what are you talking about?
I'm the cipher.
cipher for what?
an unbreakable code.
my DNA is the key.
your DNA is a key to decipher a code?
not just a code. The ultimate code.
and hidden in my DNA is the ultimate cipher.
hidden in your DNA.
I hid it there.
I'm the one who invented the code.
you invented an unbreakable code and hid the key to it in your DNA?
Yeah.
dude, that is so stupid.
Yeah.
Michael, I am no longer able to track her.
she's in the subway, KITT. Attack mode.
initiating transformation.
what's attack mod-oh-oh-oh!
transformation complete.
metro...
Michael, the shortest route takes us directly onto
I know, just do it.
I have tapped into the metro surveillance system and located her.
she appears to be meeting the blond man with the black leather jacket.
we have a three-minute window before another train is due, if the trains are on schedule.
if.
exiting the vehicle at this time will result in your death.
look, I was joking.
the, DNA the cipher for top secret codes.
I mean, who'd fall for that?
please move to the center of the car.
step back to allow the doors to close.
step back to allow the doors to close.
who are you?
you know who I am.
where did we meet?
Beirut.
I've never been to beirut.
dios mio.
you really don't remember, do you?
I have no idea who you are.
what did they do to you, Mike?
who's they?
FBI, freeze!
everybody down!
nobody move! - Mike!
what the hell just happened?
Carrie killed Mike.
some...
it was a problem, and I took care of it.
what did you do to me?
not you. Mike Traceur.
what?
I killed Mike Traceur.
the shooting victim was believed to be disgruntled iraq war vet Michael traceur...
what the hell did you do?
I did what I felt was in the best interests of this project.
and if i don't want to be dead?
your past has come back to haunt you, Mike.
if people are looking for you, you put all of us at risk.
did you read it?
Yeah, I read it.
it's incomplete, but now that you're dead, maybe you can find out what really happened.
the woman in the subway. Who is she?
I have no idea.
it's like she doesn't exist.
where are we headed, Michael?
if you plan on running away with me,
I must inform you I am the legal property of knight industries.
if you continue at this speed for no apparent reason,
I will be forced to take control of the vehicle.
I'm going home, KITT.
there is nothing at your former home, Michael.
the FBI has already been there.
Mike Traceur is legally dead.
I can't be declared dead without a body.
a body was provided.
whose body?
I am sorry, Michael, I do not have that information.
it does not seem logical to be upset about the situation.
if Mike Traceur is dead, your past can no longer come back to haunt you, or endanger Sarah, which I believe is what is preventing you from becoming close to her again.
my past will always haunt me, KITT.
driving it in. Heads up!
Billy morgan--oh.
dead man walking.
have you seen Sarah?
uh, not since carrie shot you with elephant tranquilizer.
you okay?
for a guy whose existence has just been wiped off the face of the earth, yeah, I'M...
okay.
some people would love the opportunity to start again.
I mean, the chance to negate the everyday humiliation beating on your soul like a drum from hell?
I'm saying I think it would be super cool to be able to start again.
you want to go home with me tonight?
you're just screwing with me again.
aren't you?
I don't know. Am I?
you need to come up with a new name.
or the FBI can come up with one for you.
what about buster?
my father's real name was Michael long.
Mike long?
sounds like a porn star.
total porn name.
Zoe che, phone call.
how would you know?
I watch a ton of porn.
knight industries research and development. Zoe speaking.
what did you do with the rest of him?
witness protection.
we can't have his dna fall into the wrong hands.
Yeah, right.
you know, one day Mike is gonna remember everything.
and when he does, he's gonna come after you.
well, then...
we just have to make sure he never remembers.
Hello, Michael.
Sarah's pre-set music and mood lighting are active.
I don't remember what happened to me, Sarah.
and I don't know why I don't remember, but I would never do anything to hurt you.
I'm sorry that I did.
it's not your fault you don't remember.
you want to grab a beer?
we've gone down this road before, Mike.
how about we start fresh?
I'm Michael knight.
Sarah Graiman.
so what's your sign, Michael knight?
not quite sure yet.
a little too sure I'm fine.
they make a handsome couple.
would you excuse me for a moment?
hurry back.
I have the package in sight.
Sarah, can you hear me?
authorized PERSONNEL ONLY...
VRULT...
Where's Mike Traceur?
we can do this the easy way...
or the very, very hard way.
Yes, Michael?
Sarah's not responding.
my sensors have picked up Sarah.
she is in the vault room.
you are not in the vault room with her.
Yeah, I got hung up.
Michael, you have less than two minutes to make contact, acquire the package, and retrieve the files.
not a problem.
the ambassador's gonna be more than a little upset by your treatment of his guests.
Sarah has been joined by four men, and they are armed.
guys, what are we doing?
Oh, come on, really?
Kitt, get me to Sarah now.
take the staircase on your left for the fastest route to Sarah.
keep your eyes peeled, KITT.
Michael, I do not have eyes.
it's a figure of speech.
which floor? - Basement level.
Michael, security has discovered the loop I have programmed into their surveillance system.
they are moments away from detecting the source of my tap.
I'm moving as fast as I can.
you would probably move faster if you ate a healthy diet, decreased your alcohol intake, and reduced the extracurricular activity with your lady friends.
I might as well be dead.
your death will not help Sarah in her current situation.

Michael, Sarah's heart rate and respiration have suddenly increased.
they are rising rapidly.
last chance.
Where's Mike Traceur?
Michael, you have turned the wrong way.
right, not left.
you said left.
no, Michael, I said left, left, right, left, right, left.
dude, you're confusing me! - Please remain calm.
I am calm!
my surveillance tap has been detected.
security knows we are here.
go, go, go!
there are consulate guards moving in on you from every direction.
and two armed men outside the vault room.
a little late, KITT.
stay where you are.
Michael, I am being detained.
Hey, well, get undetained.
Hey, guys.
do you know where the bathroom is? 'Cause I gotta pee.
please step away from the car, or I will be forced to take defensive measures.
dude, the car's talking to us.
big deal. My car talks to me. It's called GPS.
Yes, but can your car do this?
Michael, Sarah is in distress.
check the door.
I see you still have your reflexes, traceur.
who the hell are you?
I hate needles.
what was that for?
cause I thought I was gonna die.
Kitt, where are you? - But...
I am almost at your location, Sarah, but I have attracted me so attention.
I suggest you and Michael get to the rendezvous point as quickly as possible.
come on.
the guy with the syringe kept asking for Mike Traceur.
they weren't after the files?
no, no, I've got the files.
they were after you.
clear.
give me your hand.
Kitt, there's no time for you to stop.
now would be a good time to use the new program I uploaded.
wait, what new program?
that one.
how did he do that?
Mike, you really should pay attention in the briefings.
Sarah is right, Michael. You should.
prepare for transformation.

what kind of problem?
that kind of problem.

Kitt, stop the countdown and deploy the damn flares.
Michael, deploying flares-- - KITT, deploy the flares!
deploying flares.
flares are ineffective, Michael.
as I was trying to tell you, I cooled my heat signature to ambient air temperature.
the missile is not homing in on me, Michael.
it is homing in on you.
what do you want me to do, get out?
that would be a fatal error, Michael.
my sensors indicate something unusual about this warhead.
I may not be programmed to respond correctly.
what does he mean "respond correctly"?
please remain calm.
I have relayed our situation to dr. Graiman.
I am certain he is working on a solution as we speak.
emergency. Missile is locked on target.
knight...
there is no solution.
missile impact in 20 seconds.
this just got interesting.
prepare for impact. - 3, 2, 1...
Kitt, it's getting hot in here.
Kitt diverted just enough power at exactly the right moment to withstand that missile.
he's learning.
just like he's supposed to.
the explosive material in the missile has attached itself to my outer skin.
shed it. - I cannot.
analyze it.
I appears to be an advanced form of napalm with chemical attributes similar to that of rocket fuel.
how do we put it out?
we do not. We have to wait for it to burn out.
Kitt, the chances of Mike and I surviving the rising temperature
are 1 in 997, 000.
that is so not good.
I have diverted 60% of my power to cooling, but I am afraid it is not as effective as I had hoped.
worst case scenario, KITT?
when the temperature reaches 212 degrees, you will be boiled alive in your own bodily fluids.
best case scenario?
you will be unconscious before it happens.
we need the files they retrieved.
look, this isn't a zip drive, alex.
those are massive encrypted files.
now uploading now would drain the power from the systems keeping Sarah and Mike alive.
they lost the package, Charles.
if it falls into the wrong hands, every file we have will be compromised, including the list of our undercover operatives.
if we lose the files too-- - that's my daughter in there.
I know, Charles. I know.
but they have to upload the files.
open a line to Sarah.
Zoe, get me a secure line with israeli intelligence.
Alex...
dad.
Sarah, we need you to upload the files.
Drmagrain, diverting even the smallest amount erof pow at this time will cause a substantial increase in internal temperature.
Kitt, turn off all unnecessary systems.
Billy, figure out how to put out this damn fire.
initiating simulation.
initiating simulation.
Oh, god, don't get any ideas.
me? You're the one who just locked lips.
it was the heat of the moment, Mike.
I suggest you take off your clothes.
okay.
our bodies can't withstand the excessive temperature.
you're right.
Sarah is correct, Michael.
removing your clothes will reduce your core temperature, thereby delaying your death.
Michael, please be careful as you disrobe.
your arm is coming perilously close to the window control.
if you open the window, you will both be tly stanincinerated.
like I'm trying to get us killed.
I suggest you both refrain from speaking unnecessarily as your oxen supply is running low.
oxygen supply at 50%.
fire neutralizing.
simulation complete.
Billy, what do you got?
we need KITT to increase his speed.
if he hits 377 miles per hour, the fire will be neutralized.
how close are gonna cut it?
within seconds of their lives.
Kitt, you need to increase your speed.
increasing my speed while uploading the encrypted files will drain power necessary to keep Sarah and Michael alive.
Yeah, not a good idea.
Billy has a plan.
thanks for the vote of confidence.
sure hope it works, because if it doesn'T...
we've never hit speeds that high before, even in attack mode.
oxygen supply at 20%.
it shoulda worked.
Billy, it's not working.
it should've worked, unless
unless the chemical compound is fusing with KITT's bio material, causing a molecular reassembly.
bring 'em in hot.
that fire gets close to the weapons room, we're all dead.
if we bring 'em in in the middle of an uncontrollable molecular reassembly, we're worse than dead.
we'll bring 'em into the tunnel.
we'll shut the emergency doors, suck out all the air.
without oxygen, the fire can't breathe.
without oxygen, they can't breathe either.
Kitt, we're bringing you in hot.
affirmative, dr. Graiman.
Dr. Graiman, Michael and Sarah have lost consciousness.
how close are they?
Kitt's current speed, they'll be in the tunnel in 15 seconds.
put medical and fire teams on alert.
all medical and fire personnel report to the ssc immediately.
Dr. Graiman, as fbi agent in charge, I cannot allow you to bypass security protocol.
then Sarah and Michael die.
Carrrrie, we don't have time for this. Please.
bypass security protocol alpha delta 5-7-3.
security bypassed.
emergency hangar doors open.
re-entry unstable.
emergency procedures in effect.
warning.
molecular reassembly in progress.
excessive heat.
Dr. Graiman, Michael and Sarah have no oxygen.
please open the door.
Billy, there's no oxygen in that tunnel.
you need to open the doors now.
working on it.
we do not have time for you to work on it, Billy.
michael and Sarah will die without oxygen immediately.
I am coming in. Please open the door.
molecular reassembly halted.
impact imminent.
Billy, open the damn doors!
I can't override the emergency system.
Billy, if the door's not opened immediately, I will crash into it.
impact averted.
oxygen supply
moving in.
let's cool it off first.
that was awesome.
Zoe, I believe that "awesome" is not the appropriate word for this situation.
deep breaths.
Kitt, are you okay?
I am fine, Sarah. Are you okay?
I was worried about you and Michael.
you were worried about us?
Yes.
you're a computer, KITT. You can't worry.
artificial intelligence, Michael.
there is a difference.
I have run it through my database several times.
I believe "worry" is the appropriate word.
can I get some clothes here?
I'm fine. I'm fine.
I'm okay.
are you all right? How do you feel?
not too fast. - I got it. I got it.
you all right?
Yeah. - I'm fine. Come on.
Billy, once I complete my system diagnostics,
I will point out where you went wrong in your calculations.
thank you, KITT.
owned.
listen, zoe, I have advanced degrees in applied physics, quantum physics, electrical and mechanical engineering, chemistry, as well as discrete and applied mathematics.
and I speak nine languages.
we should make a baby.
Really? - No.
the mission was compromised.
the mission was compromised because you hit on every woman in the consulate.
I was undercover.
as what, a pimp?
four men were waiting in the vault room and they asked for me by name.
who were they? - I have no idea.
they weren't after the package or the files, but they knew I would be there.
are you implying that we have a leak?
they knew exactly when we'd be there.
don't go there, Mike.
the fbi's here to protect-- - do not tell me how to do my job!
then do your damn job, carrie.
Sarah almost died.
Sarah was trained just like everyone else.
I don't want her in the field anymore. It's too dangerous.
not your call.
we'll do the rest of KITT's repairs on the plane.
just got word the package is on the move.
yeah? Well, I thought maybe I'd grab a beer.
replenish some of those fluids I lost from almost boiling to death.
you lost the package, Mike.
wheels up in 15 minutes.
we have a problem with Mike.
what kind of problem?
take care of it.
Hello, Michael.
sorry, I didn't know you were in here.
it's okay.
it's not like you haven't seen it before.
those men from the vault room.
they know you from iraq, don't they?
they didn't have very flattering things to say about you.
Sarah, there are thingsthat I don't remember.
you don't remember?
or you don't want to remember?
lieutenant traceur!
you can't keep it all bottled up, Mike.
I'm just... - it's just what?
what are you afraid of?
what you did...
or what you're capable of doing?
both.
top secret clearance only
so where's the package?
washington D. C.
Sarah programmed the locator coordinates provided by israeli intelligence into KITT.
get the package and get back to the plane asap.
and how do I know someone won't be waiting there to kill me?
you don'T.
great.
Kitt, you sure you don't have anything on the men from the vault room?
as I told Sarah at the time, whoever they were, they were very good at getting in and getting out without being seen.
Yeah, like they knew exactly where they were going.
there is no evidence of a leak, Michael.
well, something's going on.
to alleviate your concern,
I will check the files of everyone working in knight industries' research and development department.
wait a minute, KITT. What are you saying?
the two people directly responsible for the safety and security of this project are the obvious suspects if our missions are being compromised.
no way.
just because they are your friends does not mean they are not capable of deceit.
the data I am accessing suggests that it is a very common human trait.
many high level government officials use deceit on a daily basis and still remain in office.
most of Alex Torres' files are classified, indicating he may have something to hide.
Kitt, I have classified files.
are you hiding something, Michael?
may I ask you a question?
that depends on the question.
what exactly is your relationship with Sarah?
you dated before you joined the military, and you obviously still care deeply for her.
Sarah and i are just friends, KITT.
then why do your hormone levels rise when you are around each other?
I have also detected a release of pheromones and other signs ofl exuaarousal.
whoa, KITT!
way too personal.
I wish you wouldn't do that.
we have arrived at the location of the package.
my scanners are picking up a man hiding under the bridge, and there is no sign of the package.
please be careful, Michael.
don't move.
please don't shoot.
turn around.
Where'the package?
I'm the package.
well, not all of me. Just some of me.
let's get out of here.
come on.
what did you expect, a briefcase full of plutonium?
Yeah, kind of.
Michael, a car is rapidly approaching.
Oh, my god.
it is you.
I'm sorry. Do I know you?
you know me all right.
no te recuerdas?
get in the car now!
you remember me now?
only reason why I don't kill you is 'cause I owe you.
consider us even.
okay, papito?
why'd she call him "papito"?
what does that mean?
tiny father, but that's not how she said it.
that was sexual. More like,"who's your daddy"?
you really do not know who this woman is?
never seen her before in my life.
but you have the same tattoo.
it's a military tattoo.
a lot of people who served in special forces have them.
there is nothing in any known database on her.
cross-reference her with the men from the consulate last night.
I still do not have enough information to identify the men at the consulate.
she's the second person I've never met in the last eight hours who claims they know me.
Kitt, cross-reference her with me.
Michael, even with my clearance, I cannot access your classified military files.
stop.
Where's this footage from?
beirut, lebanon.
I've never been to beirut.
the footage does not appear to have been altered.
I believe you, or someone who looks just like you, was in beirut with this woman on the date indicated.
something's not right.
Billy, open a chat line.
who the hell is she?
looks like we got us a little tongue action.
muy caliente!
ixnay on the surveillance footage-A.
Michael, why are you speaking pig latin incorrectly?
just turn it off, please.
I have no idea who she is.
the package is vital to national security, Mike.
get it back.
Yes, sir.
Kitt, I need to speak with Sarah in private.
michael needs to talk to you. please go to pod room for a secure line hello, Sarah.
cut the music.
Sarah, after i shipped out to iraq, when I stopped calling you, did I give you a reason why?
you remember that you stopped calling, but you don't remember why?
no.
all right, then...
let me jar your memory for you, Mike.
you called me from a classified location.
you wouldn't say where.
you asked me to marry you.
and I said yes.
and then you disappeared for three years.
I thought you were dead.
I asked you to marry me?
and the day you asked me is the same date that's on the surveillance footage of you in beirut.
Sarah, I have never been to beirut.
what's going on, Mike?
I gotta go.
it is possible something traumatic happened and you are repressing your memories, or you have dissociative identity disorder, also known as multiple personality disorder.
or someone doesn't want me to remember.
in re-examining your military files, I find that there are many gaps.
you seem to have disappeared for weeks, sometimes months, at a time.
Mike, did you have anything to do with an operation secure freedom?
operation secure freedom is one of your many files I was denied access to, Michael.
the men at the consulate who tried to kill you were all involved in the same black op.
you okay?
dad, something's wrong with Mike.
what are you talking about?
something happened to him in iraq.
things happen in war, Sarah.
things men don't want to talk about.
no, something else.
something different.
something very bad.
Michael, why did you disconnect agent rivai?
Kitt, I need to see inside that car.
I believe you are either repressing your memories or you are not being honest about them.
Kitt, when humans keep changing the subject, that means they don't want to talk about it.
there are some things I remember and some things I don'T.
but right now, I need to see inside that car.
using the signal from her gps, I may be able to track and follow her using real-time satellite surveillance.
can you zoom in and enhance?
boost and redirect your parabolic mics.
boosting and redirecting.
you shaved your head?
my entire body.
a single strand of my hair is worth millions.
look, fake eyebrows and eyelashes.
I also exfoliate every four hours, so there's no way you can get a sample.
wanna bet?
what are you doing?
did she just chop off his thumb?
it appears she did.
Oh, I think I'm gonna hurl.
Yep.
no, No, Hey.
gotta get my thumb back. - Come on, come on.
we gotta get my thumb back.
Mike, you have to get his thumb back at all costs.
Kitt, plot an intercept.
intercept plotted.
we're gonna need a little first aid.
accessing first aid data.
Hey, what are you doing?
I think I'm gonna pass out.
Really? - Yeah.
awesome.
what the
first aid complete.
for a follow up, please see your personal physician within the next 24 hours.
it doesn't hurt anymore.
can the people you're talking to hear and see everything inside this car?
Yes.
Kitt, shut off all contact with the ssc.
but, Michael-- - just do it.
going offline.
get audio and visual back up.
there's no way to override.
that would defeat the purpose of artificial intelligence.
okay, they can't hear or see us, and please don't tell me you know me.
no, but I know the people you work for, and they are gonna dissect me then put me under a microscope.
what are you talking about?
I'm the cipher.
cipher for what?
an unbreakable code.
my DNA is the key.
your DNA is a key to decipher a code?
not just a code. The ultimate code.
and hidden in my DNA is the ultimate cipher.
hidden in your DNA.
I hid it there.
I'm the one who invented the code.
you invented an unbreakable code and hid the key to it in your DNA?
Yeah.
dude, that is so stupid.
Yeah.
Michael, I am no longer able to track her.
she's in the subway, KITT. Attack mode.
initiating transformation.
what's attack mod-oh-oh-oh!
transformation complete.
metro...
Michael, the shortest route takes us directly onto
I know, just do it.
I have tapped into the metro surveillance system and located her.
she appears to be meeting the blond man with the black leather jacket.
we have a three-minute window before another train is due, if the trains are on schedule.
if.
exiting the vehicle at this time will result in your death.
look, I was joking.
the, DNA the cipher for top secret codes.
I mean, who'd fall for that?
please move to the center of the car.
step back to allow the doors to close.
step back to allow the doors to close.
who are you?
you know who I am.
where did we meet?
Beirut.
I've never been to beirut.
dios mio.
you really don't remember, do you?
I have no idea who you are.
what did they do to you, Mike?
who's they?
FBI, freeze!
everybody down!
nobody move! - Mike!
what the hell just happened?
Carrie killed Mike.
some...
it was a problem, and I took care of it.
what did you do to me?
not you. Mike Traceur.
what?
I killed Mike Traceur.
the shooting victim was believed to be disgruntled iraq war vet Michael traceur...
what the hell did you do?
I did what I felt was in the best interests of this project.
and if i don't want to be dead?
your past has come back to haunt you, Mike.
if people are looking for you, you put all of us at risk.
did you read it?
Yeah, I read it.
it's incomplete, but now that you're dead, maybe you can find out what really happened.
the woman in the subway. Who is she?
I have no idea.
it's like she doesn't exist.
where are we headed, Michael?
if you plan on running away with me,
I must inform you I am the legal property of knight industries.
if you continue at this speed for no apparent reason,
I will be forced to take control of the vehicle.
I'm going home, KITT.
there is nothing at your former home, Michael.
the FBI has already been there.
Mike Traceur is legally dead.
I can't be declared dead without a body.
a body was provided.
whose body?
I am sorry, Michael, I do not have that information.
it does not seem logical to be upset about the situation.
if Mike Traceur is dead, your past can no longer come back to haunt you, or endanger Sarah, which I believe is what is preventing you from becoming close to her again.
my past will always haunt me, KITT.
driving it in. Heads up!
Billy morgan--oh.
dead man walking.
have you seen Sarah?
uh, not since carrie shot you with elephant tranquilizer.
you okay?
for a guy whose existence has just been wiped off the face of the earth, yeah, I'M...
okay.
some people would love the opportunity to start again.
I mean, the chance to negate the everyday humiliation beating on your soul like a drum from hell?
I'm saying I think it would be super cool to be able to start again.
you want to go home with me tonight?
you're just screwing with me again.
aren't you?
I don't know. Am I?
you need to come up with a new name.
or the FBI can come up with one for you.
what about buster?
my father's real name was Michael long.
Mike long?
sounds like a porn star.
total porn name.
Zoe che, phone call.
how would you know?
I watch a ton of porn.
knight industries research and development. Zoe speaking.
what did you do with the rest of him?
witness protection.
we can't have his dna fall into the wrong hands.
Yeah, right.
you know, one day Mike is gonna remember everything.
and when he does, he's gonna come after you.
well, then...
we just have to make sure he never remembers.
Hello, Michael.
Sarah's pre-set music and mood lighting are active.
I don't remember what happened to me, Sarah.
and I don't know why I don't remember, but I would never do anything to hurt you.
I'm sorry that I did.
it's not your fault you don't remember.
you want to grab a beer?
we've gone down this road before, Mike.
how about we start fresh?
I'm Michael knight.
Sarah Graiman.
so what's your sign, Michael knight?
not quite sure yet.
a little too sure I'm fine.
they make a handsome couple.
it's Rivai.
what's going on?
discuss the new technology
it's a general inhibitor.
sound like a bad idea?
I don't know.
hands behind your back.
show-off.
can you pretend
according to this,
Kitt, do it now!
promise.
come on.
let's go.
I got this.
what are you gonna do?
why would he do that?

No!
we could still make it, right?
there.
get in.
or blink.

Kitt?
you okay?
Mike?
any questions?
wake up.
passive-aggressive much?
hands on your head!
we'll take a team to the rendezvous location
Oh, it's okay.
is this going to work?
Michael, can you hear me?
after you drop the item,
Mike?!
let's go to work.
it's just...
drop the case.
homeland security. we're debriefing them right now.
how's richards?
right.
I mean, it's not even so much
what did you say to me?
that is a big gun.
what kind of large weapon?
in America.
by poisoning you.
identity confirmed.
Kitt, I think I'm losing it.
what kind of obstruction?
you don't want to do this.
how hard can that be?
Yeah, I'm here.
may I?
in the meantime, take this.
and contains a large weapon.
instantly rich.
what do you know about it?
Kitt,
it might interest you to know
Kitt, put him through.
what for?
the fake story is working.
but I have faith.
I'm joking, Kitt.
I need to attain the proper angle.
if they are operational,
Mike.
I think I can handle it.
each hit is doing extensive damage
he'll find them.
it's okay.
their companies are working on the most promising r&d.
from the assassin's laptop,
patch me through.

right now it's just attempted murder.
what a relief.
I'm getting out of here now!

shall I tell Sarah
no.

Yeah.
so have we.

Hey, Kitt, have some faith, huh?
Kitt, defib.
I didn't just say that?
it is headed southwest.
I can't see a damn thing.
Sarah?
you will be dead in two hours
that's too long.
some guy paid me 300 bucks
how do people do this?
Michael's heart has stopped. He is dead.
Mike?
that Darian Richards,
it's tough saving the world.

nobody's there, Mike.
it'll have to look legit,

right. no, I did.
just hold on.
kidding.
you will rendezvous in 20 minutes

you've worn contacts before, right?
come on.

thank you so much.
in such tight quarters,

what are those for?
any idea who they are?
Sarah's out picking up her dress.

Yeah, that...

you don't ever
and she's the last one of your single friends to get married,
you are so cheesy.
our team just breached the location.
100%.
Michael, are you all right?
did Sarah go too?
your vital signs are reaching critical levels.
the way I should have.
the truth serum is taking effect
if they search us, we're done.
Kitt, you got it?
son of a
and saved by a talking car?
I can administer the correct voltage.
Kitt, we got a problem.
Yeah, how do I know there's an antidote?
I'm assuming she was not referring
Kitt, how long till it recharges?
was philadelphia, pennsylvania,
from an offshore account
Yeah, I'm all right.
Sarah!
I just hate these masks.
sounds like fun.
what do you mean may be? Give me numbers.
whatever you say.
Hello? Mike?
and not to be disturbed.

but unnecessary.
Kitt, where am I going?
Michael,
until he exits the convention center.

Oh, okay. I thought you'd be mad.
Kitt, tell me where they are,
sure.

and bringing her in for questioning
your attempt at humor would suggest
I will pull over to your side of the road.
well, national security
I am now. What's up?
Sarah asked me to have faith.
thank you.
and a dance-- deal?
Billy.
Kitt, we need adrenaline!
turn around, sir.
your heartbeat is accelerating.
cute.
