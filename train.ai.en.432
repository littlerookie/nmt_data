new democracy and pasok commanded the corrupt and clientelist system that has ruined the economy and disfigured greek society.
new democracy and pasok typically dominate parliament, and take turns governing.
new democracy could win an outright victory in a second election--allowing the party to take power alone before the midyear deadline for enacting new austerity measures, these officials believe.
new democracy is expected to emerge from sunday's election as the biggest party in greece's parliament, putting its leader, antonis samaras, in position to become prime minister.
new democracy is unlikely to win a majority.
new democracy leader antonis samaris called the result a victory for all of europe.
new democracy not only trounced its traditional archenemy, the left-of-center pasok party, which received just 12% of the vote, but also edged out its main rival this election cycle, the far-left syriza party, which took home around 27% of the vote.
new democracy would win 33% of the vote, says a recent poll, ahead of the 18% for the democratic left, led by fotis kouvelis, a veteran left-winger.
new democracy's 18.9% won it 108 seats, thanks to a rule that gives the front-running party an extra 50 seats; syriza's 16.8% got it 52 seats, and pasok got 41 seats.
new democracy, the centre-right opposition party, is withholding support for an internationally agreed austerity and privatisation plan on the ground that it can and should be renegotiated, with more emphasis on tax cuts.
new democracy, with help from the media, successfully labeled syriza as the anti-euro, anti-bailout and anti-eu party, which, if elected, would send greece straight to economic purgatory.
new democratism culture had historical progress.
