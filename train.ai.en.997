can I set up over here? -Yeah, sure, Charlie.
are these the, um... -The six still alive.
that's, uh, Estella, William Ramirez. They're the wife and son of the engineer.
probably died in the initial fireball.
Frannie Driscoll, her daughter was rescued earlier.
and that's Doug Abbott, 21. He's, uh, traveling with Susan Lang, 19.
jeffrey Knight, railroad steward. He has a radio, but it's dying.
Hey, Mr. Knight, this is Agent Granger again. How're you doing in ther
william and I are hanging in.
I can't see the others. -My leg hurts!
you're a tough guy, right?
Where's my dad? Is he okay?
Hey, buddy, you dad wants you to be brave, okay?
you can do that, right?
radio's dead. -So can we get them out of there?
we're worried about destabilizing the wreckage, or worse, the tanker.
well, my bots should help with that. -How?
they're going to explore the debris.
they'll radio back information on toxicity, temperature, topography.
I'll add that to your infrared layout.
we'll get a detailed map, and we're going to get these people out of there safely.
all right, I think I can get to this one right here.
yeah? -I'm gonna go for it.
all right, Charlie.
what did the bomb squad say?
do they have any idea what caused the railment?
they can't find the set-off point.
it could be on the track, in which case, it would be under the wreckage.
or a bomb could've been on the cargo train itself, the engineer was Syrian.
either way, it derails.
the passenger train pierces the tanker, ignites the chemicals, releases toxic gas into a denselyopulated area.
what are you basing your theory on?
don's thinking terrorism.
what, are you talking for me? Don't do that.
you implied that...
you need to listen more and talk less. Understand?
so we got no national security events in the area in the last 24 hours.
I'm running a Risk Measure with data from the railroad, the chemical company, the NSA and the FBI Counter-terrorism Unit.
but a terrorist attack is not well-supported.
right-- and what'd the dispatcher say?
James Malin. NTSB intervied him on the scene, did a drug-alcohol test, then I released him to go to his second job.
you what? -NTSB already interviewed him.
we do our own interviews. Go pick him up again.
all right, I'll check on the Syrian engineer's terrorist connections.
you know, just for kicks.
Amita, what do you think? An accident?
I mean, there's no apparent equipment or system failures.
but I'm going through every keystroke and voice communication up to the crash.
now, I'll have more of an opinioin a few hours.
medic!
we need a medic over here!
you okay? -Yeah, I'm okay.
she's the last one I could pull out without destabilizing the whole pile, though.
easy.
How're the robots coming?
it's gonna be a little while.
where...
Where's my son?
it's okay, ma'am. Take it easy.
he's probably already been taken to the hospital, ma'am. He's okay.
no, no, no! William was in front of me.
your son is William? -Yes!
he's asthmatic; I have to get him!
easy, easy. You let us take care of that. You let us take care of it.
Where's my husband? Ralph Ramirez.
he was driving the train. Where is he?
I'm sorry.
No!
No! William!
I have to get William, please! -Take it easy.
: I have to get William! William!
hazmat found one of the leaks, but air quality remains the same at two parts per million.
we'll see if it dissipates in the next hour.
there's no way of knowing what's inside the crushed car.
Charlie just inserted the robots into the pile.
the swarmbots are giving us an excellent transmission.
it's looking for heat signatures.
: okay.
we have a fatality.
Yeah, but it looks like there's a void right here we could probably climb into.
no, no. The bots are reporting instability in that quadrant.
I believe the, uh, deceased is Frannie Driscoll.
well, she was alive, generating a heat signal, just a couple hours ago.
she probably couldn't handle the methyl isocyanate.
you said the levels weren't high enough to kill anybody.
not enough to kill a healthy adult, but the wounded, weakened, children and the elderly are much more vulnerable.
so the boy and the old man are in trouble.
william is more at risk to corrosive agents, because of the smaller diameter of his airways.
William, it'll be okay. You're gonna be all right, okay?
we're coming for you. -She got the boy on his cell phone.
William, William, are you there?
I lost him, I lost him. -I'll get cell phone numbers for the rest of them.
did they get everybody out? -You were the dispatcher.
why were you in such a rush to leave the scene?
I got two jobs.
and if I lose this one 'cause of the accident...
why would you lose your job?
somebody's got to take the fall.
ain't usually the big dogs.
so, if it's me, I really need the second job.
I-I got seven kids, my wife's got Lupus...
tell me about last night.
shift starts at 4: 00. Nothing unusual.
around 7: 00, the Desert Pacific Rider checks in at mile post 112-9, and I authorize the switch at the south yard.
the conductor said that the switch flag wasn't up.
maybe it was stuck.
but I doubt it.
cause if there's any mechanical problems, it shows up on my screen and the train's computer and about three or four backups.
NTSB said no mechanical failure.
just check the records.
I activated the switch when the train was five minutes out.
and it-it worked.
why would the conductor lie?
maybe he was coming in too fast.
maybe he was doped up.
his tox screen was clean, like yours.
maybe it was a bomb.
it was terrorists? Have you thought about that?
you think it was a derailment?
you have to get those passengers out of there.
this crash could be the end of my business.
let me ask you something: You guys run old trains? -No, nothing like that.
until a couple months ago, these hazardous chemicals were transported by Markovius Trucking.
Roman Markovius? -Yeah.
the mobster; the king of trucking. I underbid him.
what, he threaten you?
well, he let me know he doesn't like losing money.
but he better get used to it; trucks are history.
he puts me out of business, someone else is gonna pop up to take my place.
this one looks promising.
could you get another one of your bots over there to check it out?
they've already figured out that they need to explore that passage.
it's okay, baby. It won't be long now, okay?
you try and slow down your breathing, okay?
there's a leg right there. -It's a child's.
William! Oh, no, William!
Hey, hey, it's okay, buddy. No, it's all right.
what's wrong? -No, buddy, it's okay.
your m-mom's fine.
she's doing just fine. All right?
we're about to suit up, and we're gonna come in there, and we're gonna come get you.
all right? It's gonna be a cool rescue.
like Iron Man.
now, we're gonna need your help, too. Okay, buddy?
what's wrong with my mom?
okay, baby, I'm back.
okay, you be brave.
come here a minute.
what's going on? -Man, you got to be careful.
there's a possibility that kid's not gonna make it. You got to brace yourself for that.
all right?
word is you don't like to lose money. -Well, luckily, that's not happening.
you just lost a big contract to Desert Pafic Rail.
in general, business is good.
specifically, I am not incentivized to sabotage railroads, as you are no doubt about to accuse me.
Incentive-what?
I just bought a sizable stake in rail transport.
it's my business now. Why would I harm it?
well, one reason is you'd bring prices down. You could snatch up inventory.
you think like a criminal.
that's how I catch them.
diversification works better than breaking kneecaps. So I diversified.
we didn't touch Desert Pacific Rail.
richard Cory sows the seeds of his own demise.
whatever that means.
213-555-0172. That's Douglas Abbott, 21, Portland, Oregon.
this is Agent Granger of the FBI.
great, man. Where you been?
listen, we're coming in to get you.
Hey, ask him about the person next to him. -Okay.
all right, David, memorize this.
nine meters six meters left 30 degrees, seven meters right 15 degrees-- you got it?
got it.
all right. Susan Lang. She's 19. Seems to have a broken arm, but otherwise...
this metal...it's cooled down now. I think I can push it out of the way.
what's he doing? No, he'll cause a collapse.
no, no, no. Tell him to stop! Tell him not to move.
Doug, wait a minute. Doug, don't-don't try to help.
don't move anything. -No!
Doug, can you hear me?
Hey. We can find ice on Mars, but we can't get people out of tangled metal 20 feet away.
COLB You should try and catch some Z's, David.
we've been going, like, 40 hours now.
the other case was yesterday-- it feels like a week ago.
look, uh, did you... have you talked to, uh, Doug and Susan's parents in Oregon?
did you call them?
we don't legally know they're dead.
their heat signatures are gone; they're dead, okay? And we know it.
did you talk to the parents or not?
they're flying in, David. Take a break, all right?
napping is the smartest thing you can do right now.
here's what I want to know. The geniuses, they lost half of their robots in the collapse. Right?
now they're starting over, and they're mapping us a way inside.
how long do we wait?
you gotta just chill, man.
you're doing great, baby. Be brave for Mama, okay?
how's he doing?
hold on, William-- I'll be right back.
he can't breathe. It's getting worse.
try to get him to, uh, remain calm.
how long are we supposed to wait on this Yellow Brick Road of yours?
dial down your attitude, man, I... -No.
we lost six robots and two people in that last collapse. Now, you give me a firm percentage.
how much of what you're working on is hot air? -Hot air?
50%? 60%? You just tell me.
you want to cause 50 tons of steel to crush this kid and crack open a toxic tanker so that we can all be dead in the next half hour, then you be my guest and dive in there!
you can't guarantee that it's not gonna happen when I have a new map!
David, patience-- "patience achieves more than force. " Edmund Burke, statesman.
you take patience too far, and then you have cowardice.
george Jackson, Black Panther.
I have reprogrammed this bot to locate William's cell phone-- it should find the most efficient route.
for a six-inch Tinker Toy.
I need... I need to get in there. I need you to find a space that I can fit in.
that's what the other bots are working on, okay? Listen.
listen-- William's low body weight makes him more susceptible to those toxins, all right?
so, yeah, he's...
he's dying. -He's dying.
Yeah, I know that. And if he gets this inhaler, then it'll buy us more time to get to him.
: all right.
I can't find what caused the derailment.
I mean, the switch happened four minutes before the crash.
how do you know that?
because it's recorded here in the computer output.
Yeah, but what's recorded?
the time of the dispatcher hitting the button or the actual switching of the iron pieces?
that's a good question.
the switching sequence requires two actions from the dispatcher.
he entered the first command at 7: 01, before the crash.
then nothing for three and a half minutes.
derailment occurred at 7: 04.
the second command switch was entered seven seconds later, after the crash.
NTSB said that the switch happened on time at 7: 01.
think of it as a plane that's scheduled to depart at 7: 00.
if it leaves the gate at 7: 00, then taxis across the tarmac and actually takes off at 7: 04, the public record has it down as an on-time departure at 7: 00.
the time of the first command is often recorded as the time of completion, usually because it's just a few seconds difference.
he starts the sequence, but he doesn't finish.
and then, after derailment, he finishes it on the computer, even though the actual physical switch had already been destroyed.
but it's all recorded as if it happened before the crash.
and we're absolutely sure the command came from the dispatcher's computer, right? Not, like, a hacker...
well, I'm working on an electronic fingerprint.
all right, good. Let me know if you get anywhere with that.
and Markovius was telling the truth about buying a stake in the rail business.
the Organized Crime Task Force says he doesn't need to play dirty, you know?
he makes his money inside the system just like any other greedy businessman.
right, like Richard Cory-- I mean, that guy bugs me.
I'll put him under the microscope, see what I find.
let's get that dispatcher back in here, all right?
Mr. Malin, hey. Come on, wake up.
anyone visit you at work last night?
no. -No?
Oh, wait a minute.
I'm not sure.
what night is it now? What's today's date?
last night was the night of the crash. Did anyone visit you?
no.
we have logs. You could check 'em.
no one paid you to look the other way while they got on your computer?
are you crazy?
I would never do that.
you fell asleep.
look at you, you can't even keep your eyes open. That's what happened, isn't it?
you fell asleep while you were making the switch. -No. Why are you...
the alarms went off, and you woke up, and then you finished it.
I made the switch.
Mr. Malin, that switch was made after the crash. This is a fact; we know it.
my wife is sick.
so I got to take care of the kids between my jobs.
I haven't slept...
in about a week.
last night, I...
I had trouble focusing my eyes, so...
I thought I finished the switch, and...
I went in the bathroom to put some cold water on my face.
it used to be that there were t of us who worked the same shift, but...
the company made cutbacks.
I came back in the room, the alarms were going off, and...
like you said, I just...
I didn't mean to.
: I'm sorry. I am so sorry.
the little bot who could.
okay, William, listen up, buddy We have this little robot that's gonna make its way over to you, all right?
it's gonna bring you some medicine, it's gonna help you with your breathing, okay?
: okay.
I'm...thirsty. -I know, I know.
you're doing a great job, buddy.
can you put Mr. Knight on the phone? Can you do that?
three more meters.
this map will be complete in a half hour, if William can just hold on.
no, no, no.
what? What? What happened?
hold on. Hold on, Mr. Knight, hold on.
it can't cross. -Why?
because this bot has to link to the other bots in order to cross an opening over ten inches wide.
listen, now, we're gonna need you to help us out here. Okay?
we need you to keep William breathing slowly.
I can do that. -All right.
you think I-I... you think I'm holding something back?
David, we're close. -You've been saying that all night!
David, please.
no more waiting, Charlie. Okay?
no more waiting. -Now, come on. David.
no.
David's gone into the pile without the map.
where is he? -I don't know.
come on, come on. Okay, that's him.
all right, he's on track so far. He's been studying that map for the last hour.
David, can you hear me? -He can hear you.
all right, buddy, stay cool-- you're doing great.
that's a hot zone. It's a hot zone.
what does that mean? Is it toxic?
no, but there's fire under that section. That metal's really hot-- tell him to stay right.
all right, David, you got to stay right. Stay to the right, David.
to the right.
David, can you hear me? David!
what happened?
he went in for the rescue before the route was clear; he's not answering.
Charlie, is he...?
no, his heat signatures are strong. He's alive, but the collapse increased the flow of toxic gas.
how do we get him out? You got any ideas.
well, have a map of the pile before the crash. We know where he went wrong.
what about the robots? -I lost them all.
but look, whatever fell on David didn't kill him, so I estimated a range for that weight and did a progressive collapse analysis-- here.
which tells us...?
which piece of the pick-up sticks to remove to avoid another collapse.
all right, well, tell us where to make a hole. I'll go in on a cable and I'll pull him out.
okay, stop.
all right, guys, down easy; let me down easy.
careful, careful.
David, can you hear me?
William, can you hear me?
Mr. Knight?
jeffrey Knight? -Yes.
can you reach me?
I'm trying.
all right, Charlie, where is he?
he's crawling toward William, Colby. You're not far enough in.
all right, got ya.
I'm at a dead end, guys.
no, that can't be. You must've taken a wrong turn.
well, I did exactly what you said.
nine straight in, six left 30 degrees.
seven right 15 degrees.
Colby, are you counting in meters?
that's the problem. I'm counting in yards.
I'll go back and do it right.
well, you don't have to go back to the beginning.
just go to the first juncture and add 3. 28 feet.
Yeah, give or take, 0.28 feet, got it.
and then recount from there. -Will do.
I should have double-checked that.
it's all right. It's all right. -Everyone's exhausted.
: all right, I see him.
thank you, God. Thank you.
what took you so long, man?
I don't know how to get out of here.
don't worry. I left us bread crumbs.
we need to keep this mask on his face.
I brought an inhaler.
okay, breathe in through that, okay?
why don't you ease him on over here?
okay. All right. Here.
okay, Mr. Knight, it's your turn, sir.
I'm gonna hand you this mask. I want you to put it on your face, okay?
thank you. Thank you.
all right, guys, we're coming out, okay?
okay, good job. You do that.
see you guys on the outside.
Oh, God, ihe okay?
Oh, honey!
is he okay?
send that cable back over here, will ya?
all right, David, it's coming back at ya, buddy.
hang in there, man, it's coming.
I don't know how. Thank you.
made it, Mr. Knight.
we made it.
I'm gonna lift you up, all right?
all right, come on.
easy.
okay, they're on thr way out.
Charlie, listen.
Hey, look, go home. Go get some rest, man.
it's okay.
no...
no, I know what happened.
Hey, I know what happened.
just let me see those train records. I'll be able to prove it.
whoa, whoa, prove what?
listen, even if that switch wasn't in the correct position, that train should have come to a stop based on its weight and speed.
actually, that's what the conductor saw.
he runs his train with math.
mass and velocity determine the distance required to stop, so he must have had the wrong weight.
that train was heavier than that conductor thought, making his calculations for stopping incorrect.
well, that I can check.
you did great.
easy.
Hey, man, great job. -Yeah, yeah.
killed my bots, man.
Yeah, well, they all deserve Purple Hearts.
put little badges on the next ones.
Yeah, armor 'em a little better. -Yeah.
you did great, Mr. Knight.
you did great.
hold on.
all right. Ease off.
sorry about that, Charlie. I had to do it.
it's no sweat. I was about to go in there myself.
agents, thanks for your efforts.
get your hands behind your back. You're under arrest. -For what?
lying about the cargo tonnage in order to save money, so you could undercut bids.
sending out 12, 000 tons. Listed only 10, 000.
who'd you bribe for that, by the way?
maybe there was an error.
Yeah, like, how many times you got away with it.
do you know what? We're gonna find out all about that.
if you'd have played by the rules-- yeah, there would have been a switching error
but that train would have stopped in time.
none of this would've even happened.
tell me that y've never cut corners to get the job done. -Watch your head.
I don't want you doing stuff like that, okay?
I want you being better than me.
you did all right today.
wake up, I'll give you a ride home.
yeah... uh, yeah.
'=www. ydy. com/bbs=- Proudly Presents
hello. - Do not hang up on me this time.
what, Addison? - She still won't talk to me.
hello. - Hey, so listen, just hear me out, all right?
so? -Hates me, too.
am I boring you?
I'm sorry. I'm supposed to be at a meeting.
Violet's meeting. Violet's super secret meeting to overthrow the government.
you people are odd.
now that sam's running things, he's pushing us to book more and change things, and so-- and so I don't get properly laid.
Yes, you're the victim. You're the silent victim.
you know, it's not like you've given me permission to tell Violet why I can't come to her meeting.
do not tell Violet about us. - I know.
I have to go. I'll make it up to you. What are you doing for lunch?
we don't do public.
peppone. 1: 00.
it's a symptom of the disease- it's a board with dots on it.
this practice used to be about people working together.
this board is about people looking out for themselves.
it's profit-centric. It's not patient-centric.
it's about unilateral decision making and assembly-line medicine, like--like sam's "executive physicals" and the cheetah girl temp.
she's another symptom, hormone man. - She's a cute symptom.
Naomi? - I am not in charge anymore.
let sam try it sam's way.
Sam and addison pulled off a coup.
dell's gone. We--we have to do something.
looks like we missed the secret meeting. - We weren't invited.
we did the right thing, right?
Yes, we did the right thing. We did the only thing we could do.
this is just a small storm. It will blow over.
Oh, storm's coming.
can I have my messages? -Yes.
morning, Sam Addison. - Oh, I thought you weren't talking to us.
while I am not talking to you socially, I am talking to you professionally because this is a place of business.
so morning, Sam Addison.
Hey, you guys.
morning. -Nice board, Sam.
Oh, thanks. Yeah, Dell's gone, so I'm just trying to keep track of, uh, scheduling.
Oh, I-I.
I thought it was something different. - What?
I thought that you wanted to publicly humiliate everyone who wasn't booking enough so you put your big, showy board of shame in this fish bowl for everyone to see.
no, it's--that's not. it's not a board of.
a board of shame. - It's A.
board of accomplishment. yeah.
well, you would say that. - It's a board with dots on it.
what do you mean, I would say that? -Well, you're on sam's side.
no, no, Violet. I'm on the practice's side.
wait, hey, hey.
now this board is a-- it's a useful tool. All right?
now just give it a chance. The dots, they tell me who's busy.
now if we look over here, Pete is all empty here.
I can tell that he's available to help me with the executive physicals. That's a big group deal we cut.
cash influx.
I'm sorry, but I don't have time.
the--the board would indicate otherwise.
Oh, Pete--well, you can't just make up patients, pete. - I'm not.
I made a few calls, and I'm trying something new to drum up business.
what the hell is that? - It's a cutting-edge, noninvasive cellulite reduction system.
it's a defatalator? - Good thinking.
your column's weak, Coop. - I'm on it.
do you see what this board of shame is doing?
Cooper can't even look at it.
you've forced Pete to de-fat innocent people.
noninvasive cellulite re-- if this is where this practice is headed
we're headed toward bankruptcy.
I hope this is an acceptable detour.
I can't take it. I honestly cannot take it.
don't you care? Well, you didn't even show up for the meeting.
I was doing-- I was doing something. - What?
Cooper, I just want to say that, um, if there is something that you want to tell me, but you're afraid to tell me, you could tell me anyway. I won't get mad.
we're friends. I'm your friend.
so anything you would like to not keep secret, I'm open.
I'm sorry I wasn't at the meeting.
I just--I need to stay under the radar. I don't want to be the dead weight that gets traded out for the plastic surgeon.
Hey, coop, come on. That's an excuse.
tell me.
do we have to share every detail? Do we have to be joined at the hip?
we're not 12. -Oh, glad you could clear that up for me.
I was so sure we were 12.
I know we're young, but we've been married for five years, and we've been dreaming about kids for longer.
Yeah, since junior high. - Junior high?
that's where we met.
one day I was a complete loner, and then the next day, I had lisa.
it's like looking into a mirror-- same interests, same cds, same books, movies.
we even have the same allergies.
grass and peanuts. -And peanuts, yeah.
I found my best friend.
do you know how rare that is, to find a best friend?
Yeah.
we already decorated the nursery.
we just need the baby.
please.
okay.
so you're really not going to speak to me about anything other than work?
for instance, the cop, kevin, he hasn't called.
we had a date. I thought it was a good date, and then he didn't call, which is something you and I would normally talk about.
Really? You really want to do this?
I'll take Brian. You take lisa?
fine.
I gotta thank you. My day is filled with your company's employees.
Oh, well. If anyone else had tried to sell me on executive physicals,
I would've thought it was a crock sales pitch, but I've watched you with my son for so long.
well, kirk is amazing given all that he's been through.
well, and it turns out your good business is my good business.
morale is up, productivity this quarter is through the roof, so, well, I'm glad that your employees are happy.
they love seeing you.
I wish kirk did, too. I had to drag him here today, does he need another lecture on taking his meds?
17 years old, thinks he knows better than everyone.
I hate this disease. I didn't know it could damage his lung tissue so badly.
Yeah, bronchiolitis obliterans can be brutal.
he still getting dizzy from the meds?
his breathing's getting worse, and I stay on him.
if his mother was still alive, she would know how to talk to him.
see, the more I push, the more he pushes back
Kirk? Help me get him on the table.
I need some help in here!
I need an intubation kit now.
he's not breathing. - He's in respiratory arrest.
I got Brian and Lisa's genetic tests back.
you know why they can't get pregnant? - No, but I know why they shouldn't.
what am I looking for here?
there's no marker for down syndrome, tay-sachs.
they look healthy. - Individually they are, but as a couple,
almost a quarter of their genes are the same.
they're not just husband and wife.
they're brother and sister.
is that how the defatalator works?
you lose weight by pushing it up and down the hallway?
I need Dell or an extra set of hands.
is this a unitard? - It gets 'em in the door.
it says they wanna start living a healthier lifestyle.
by melting fat?
it doesn't melt fat, Violet, but it does break it down.
and with exercise and diet, herbs
Oh, it's a quick fix, Pete. This is not us.
patients come to see us because we take care of all of them-- body, mind, soul.
Sam is paving the road to hell.
it's just a machine. - It's hamburger.
we used to give them steak. - People like hamburger.
the scring from the virus has gotten much worse, and his lung function tests show a large decline.
but you can get him through this, right, get him back home?
well, being on a ventilator will help heal his lungs.
hopefully we can get him home, but he's gonna need a lot more attention
oxygen supplementation, I.V. Meds.
well, I'll scale back at work. I don't care.
the idea of losing him, too.
I don't want this.
I told you already, I can't do it again.
don't say that. Just put this back in, now. - No, it hurts.
this is the fourth time, dad.
I can't do it.
I can't talk. I can't do anything.
Kirk, the intubation is only temporary. - I'm getting worse.
dad, the tracheotomy is next. I can't do that.
I will throw everything I have at this.
we will find something. This gives us time.
do it.
don't! - All right.
no tube, not right now. Just.
just breathe.
there we go.
I don't want this life.
not this way. Let me die.
sperm donor. - Sperm donor.
the parents used the same sperm donor. What are the chances?
well, 25 years ago, there were only a couple of fertility clinics in this town.
so everybody who was having trouble getting pregnant went to the same doctor?
and the doctors used the same batch of donors over and over again.
Yeah, it makes you think twice about messing with mother nature, huh?
I don't mess with mother nature.
I use science-- no, I wasn't say-- I.
I was just saying that-- right.
so how do we tell them? How do we tell a couple that's meant to be together that they're not?
well, everything they know is gonna be tainted-- their childhood, their families.
we have to let them know that it's not their fault.
well, it isn't. I mean, they didn't know that they were brother and sister.
and no one else needs to know.
who they tell, what the say, that's their choice.
so not only do they have to split up, they have to lie to everyone they know.
well, incest is a loaded word.
the visceral response is revulsion, ostracism.
they look like. - any other young couple in love.
and we get to be the ones to break their hearts.
you coach two little league teams. You're telling me you don't know one sick kid?
not even a cold?
Oh, okay. Gotta go. Bye.
Oh, that's your plan to get new business, cold-calling?
no.
no.
it worked for Pete.
wanna get some lunch, take a break from the madness?
I can't. I'm already booked.
with? - A friend.
I know you're lying to me. You know you're lying to me.
we both know, and yet lying.
what is wrong with you?
it's crazy, but I feel lighter already.
well, that's only step one.
to really see results, you have to stick to the exercise and diet we discussed, and the herbs.
maybe I'll just come back every day.
that seems easier.
did you get Kirk stabilized?
uh, temporarily.
when he came to, he extubated himself.
he's letting himself die. - He is dying.
maybe it's time to start thinking about hospice instead of hospital.
no. Charlie won't do that.
come on, sam. How old is kirk?
he won't be 18 until next month.
who's not 18, that new receptionist? - No, my patient.
and because the poor kid crashes a few weeks shy of his 18th birthday, you're gonna force him to indulge his father's grief and lie in bed with an intubation tube jammed down his throat?
until what, the ulcers and the hemorrhaging get so bad, he needs a trach?
no 17-year-old kid should be making life and death decisions.
he's been fighting this since he was 12. - He's done.
look, Charlie's wife died two years ago.
now you want me to fault him for wanting to buy his son just.
a little more time? -Time for kirk to live.
or for Charlie to hold on?
we're brother and sister?
my parents never even told me my father wasn't my father.
well, I'm sure they didn't think it was anything that would ever be relevant.
and for all intents and purposes, it wasn't.
this is a nightmare.
look, this is a lot to absorb. Why don't we give you a few minutes?
did you see the look on her face?
see, normally this would be the part where I'd be asking you about Kevin again, if you think I should call him even though he hasn't called me.
normally that's what we'd be doing right now if you were talking to me, nai. - Don't.
Nai-- look, I'm being an adult about this, Addison. It does not mean that I forgive you.
than you for telling us.
if there's anything that we can do.
you can help us get pregnant.
but we just told you that-- we heard what you said, but we're soul mat.
we love each other.
we're staying together.
cousins get married all the time. They have kids. Why can't we?
because your children would have a 300 times greater chance of developing a genetic disorder, which could be fatal.
what about sperm donation?
for a couple who, by law, shouldn't be married? I can't.
then we'll adopt.
the first thing an adoption agency will look at is your medical history.
they'll see your relationship and they won't-- I-- I'm sorry.
so no kids.
we just forget about kids.
as long as we can be together-- without sex?
because no birth control is 100%.
then tie my tubes. - Lisa, you're 23 years old.
just tie them so I never have to think about this again.
you were supposed to remind me about the, uh, the health fair.
Oh! Sorry. Wait.
the company that rents your ultrasound machines did call.
and they're gonna send a truck to pick them up around 1: 00.
pick them up? Did they mention why?
you haven't paid in three months. - What?
are you okay?
can you cover at the health fair please? - Uh, no.
uh, I'm working through lunch.
check the board.
Cooper, my man. Health fair-- great way to get new patients.
I, uh, I have lunch plans.
lunch plans are more important than the practice? - Really?
what web site did you find her on?
Yeah, Cooper, which web site?
I have a limit to how far you can push, Violet.
all right, cooper, grab a stethoscope, go get some damn balloons and go charm some mothers who don't know any better.
I'm, uh, hiding medical equipment.
I've been reduced to hiding medical equipment.
well, I have been asked to tie the tubes of a perfectly healthy young woman so that she can sleep with her brother. Incest trumps equipment hiding.
incest? That's--that's nasty.
so what does Naomi say?
that is a very good question, sam.
what does naomi say?
as little as possible because she is professional and courteous, and she hates me.
and I can't even talk to her about the fact that she hates me or about the practice or Kevin
or-- or Kevin? - My cop. No, S.W.A.T. actually.
um, we had a date. It was a good date, you know?
and he hasn't called and.
you're a man. Why do you guys do that?
uh, well, did you-- did you try calling him?
no. Why should I? He knows I want to talk to him.
well, he would if you-- you called him.
you suck at being Naomi.
Yeah, got that right.
what kind of a defect do you have? - I'm sorry.
I get one hour for lunch. I was halfway across town.
I ordered wine, I found a quiet corner booth, which was good, because otherwise, I might have missed your text.
I should have called. - No.
you never should have invited me to a lunch you didn't plan on attending.
I'm not looking for a relationship or love or any of that garbage, but I won't be treated like I don't matter.
please tell me you didn't just piss off Charlotte King.
Oceanside Wellness Group. - Of course not.
what was she doing here?
I don't know, but I told her I couldn't talk 'cause we're busy.
Sam, you have a call. - Just take a message, please.
um, can I take a message?
which collection agency was it this time?
it was the hospital. -The hospital?
well, why didn't you-- I'm anding.
what was it? - Some guy-- Charlie Jensen?
he wanted you to meet him there.
you gotta put the tube back in. - Kirk's right.
he's not getting any better. - Kirk's tired of being sick.
you think I don't get that?
but he doesn't see this from every angle like I do.
I know how to approach a problem.
I don't care how much money or time we have to put into this.
we're gonna fight this.
he's a teenager, sam.
he's a teenager whose life isn't over yet.
he's a month away from being 18.
you're not the only doctor in town, sam. I could take my son and my business.
you chased me hard for those executive physicals. - Are you threatening me?
you have a lot of expenses, sam. You really wanna let a huge chunk of business walk out the door?
if there was someone you loved, wouldn't you do everything to save them?
his sats are dropping. They're dangerously low.
you gotta put the tube back in. - He's just gonna pull it back out again.
then restrain him.
all right, give him 20 milligrams of etomidate and 100 of sux.
Kirk, we're gonna give you a little something to relax you, and then we're gonna have to intubate you again.
I don't-- I don't want-- all right, relax.
Hey, easy. Give me those restraints.
I'm sorry, but I have to do this. - Do you?
all right, I'm gonna need an 8-0, an E. T. Tube and a mac blade, please.
Dr. Montgomery.
I wanted to talk to you alone, without Brian.
if you get your tubes tied, you wanted a child.
no, don't.
please just hear me out.
I know what you say we are, and I know that.
this is disgusting to you-- it's not-- he's all I have.
Brian-- he's all I've ever had.
I was shy before him. I was shy and brian sees me.
he sees me and he knows me and he loves me.
my whole life, I felt like there was this missing piece of me, like I didn't fit, and Brian.
he's my missing piece, so before you say no to the surgery, consider.
just consider what you're asking of me.
you're asking me to make myself less whole, to lose a part of me.
he's my missing piece.
my best friend is my missing piece.
Hey, sam.
you make a decision about kirk?
Yeah, I reintubated him. - Against his wishes.
against his expressed wi
I did what his father-- his legal guardian-- wanted.
now kirk's underage. I had no choice.
Yes, you did. You chose to ignore your patient's wishes to keep his father happy- because keeping Charlie Jensen happy is good for business. - Pete, you're not being fair.
how much are we taking in on these physicals, sam? Enough to put his kid through hell?
I made my decision. - You made the wrong one.
I'm in charge here. Okay? Me. I am in charge.
so why don't you go back to sucking the fat out of people and making us money, and let me do what I need do to save this place?
it's a cellulite reduction system.
Pete, Pete-- no, don't.
what's the most important question, sam, what's best for the practice or what's best for the patient?
I wish I had what they have.
you-- you want to sleep with your brother? - No, that kind of devotion.
they're a team, best friends, joined at the hip. They deserve to be happy.
they are a brother and sister who want to have sex with each other.
Oh, come on. It's not like they were raised as brother and sister.
you're actually considering this? -The client wants what they want.
and so you're gonna sterilize them so they can stay incestuous?
well, stepchildren who grow up together end up marrying.
I- I think that's worse.
they're raised as brother and sister.
Yeah, well, you're a shrink, and you believe that nurture is more important than nature, but, but biology says this is wrong.
is it really ours to decide?
I mean, these people are everything to each other. I've never seen a couple so close.
because they found love, or because they're genetically similar?
um, I just heard. How did Hansel and Gretel take the news?
gretel wants her tubes tied.
you guys are actually considering this?
Uh,"they" guys, not "me" guy.
you want to sponsor inbreeding? That is gross, and, you know, I know gross.
it's not inbreeding if we do a tubal ligation.
interesting point, but as the American medical association guideline points out.
stop it! They probably tell each other everything.
they don't lie to each other.
sounds nice.
Oh, do I get a dot for the consult? - Get out.
listen, you--you cannot consider this.
kids are the one thing that they both wanted.
that and each other.
I don't think this is how Hansel and Gretel is supposed to end.
no, no, no! Wrong way.
watch out for the doctor.
uh, scrub hard. I'll talk to you soon.
lice. - No, doesn't count.
Cooper, you had those kids since they were babies. We need new business.
don't say it. - Say what?
that, uh, what, I've been chasing cases, that I'm running this place like a factory, 'cause, all right, I've been doing the best I can.
and somebody had to do something.
I was going to fix this. I just needed time.
I needed a little faith in what, whoa, whoa.
what about a little faith in us, huh, and telling us the truth?
Addison and I-- you know, when-- when did this become about you and Addison?
when you started keeping things from us.
you know, Addison didn't start this practice with you from nothing.
she didn't work Saturdays to pay the bills while you wrote your book.
she didn't have to play traffic cop and den mother while all of you got to play idealistic doctor.
I'm just trying to save what we started.
well, if we keep doing things your way, Sam, is it worth saving?
come on, Charlotte. Call me back or leave me a message or send me an obnoxious text.
we'll, uh.
sorry, yeah. Uh, leave me a message.
actually, the treatment is performed on the whole body, adapted for the skin sensitivity of each individual, so-- this place is bad enough without you trying to sell your magic beans to everyone.
I mean, does she really look like she needs help?
does that body need anything?
I mean, does any body really need its fat pulverized into submission?
violet, Violet, you know what you are?
you are A.
a- a- a judger.
you're a judgy judger who has no right to judge until she tries it for herself.
she-- she can't be.
well, she is.
violet. You really think it's her?
Oh, it's her. You really think it works?
you okay? - Yeah.
here, switch.
why would she stoop to this? She hates that thing?
I don't know w--oh, and right there, please.
and again.
is Violet defatalating?
sorry?
she better be paying.
maybe I was too judgmental. - See?
maybe I'm wrong about everything.
you're bringing in new clients, Sam has his physicals, even Cooper got some new business at that stupid health fair.
and I.
I actually think I'm getting thinner.
you don't lose weight just by w-waving the wand.
everyone who comes through that door, they don't want to talk about a healthy life plan.
all they want is magic.
this isn't magic. This is A.
this is crap.
Hey, it doesn't matter.
you don't need to lose weight. Your.
your ass looks fantastic.
I know my ass looks fantastic. But thank you for saying it, not for thinking that I don't have enough self-esteem to love my own ass..
I love my ass.
it is round and firm and, like, like, ten years younger than the rest of me.
it's a fantastic ass.
men cannot keep their hands off my ass.
stop touching my ass!
damn it, the practice is going to hell, and Cooper is lying to me, and I am sitting here encouraging you to rub fat off my ass.
life is not ass fat, and if it is, it's not ass fat that can magically disappear with a wand.
what are we gonna do?
they're here.
you know what you're gonna tell 'em?
if I tell them no, they're just gonna go to someone else.
well, I guess you'll do what you feel is best.
okay, what do you want me to say to you, that I am sorry?
because I'm not. I was trying to savehe practice. I was trying to help you.
Oh, wow. Well, thanks for helping me.
you know what? This is my practice, too.
I gave up a hell of a lot to come down here.
and I came down here for you, for you and Sam.
you went behind my back and you hurt me, and it can't be undone.
some things just can't be undone.
well, will you tie my tubes?
because if so, we thought maybe you could do it today.
we can't-- we can't take another day of this, another night.
we didn't sleep.
we just want everything back the way it was.
so will you? -Will you?
you're brother and sister.
now how can you go back to the way things were when you know you're brother and sister?
knowing doesn't change anything.
it doesn't change how we feel about one another.
it changes everything, and it can't be undone.
because we know? You're wrong.
it doesn't matter.
you think if we'd known before we got married, wouldn't have? Well, we would.
I- I don't think so.
it didn't matter to me when I found out. I still married her.
you still married me?
I- I mean-- I'm just-- I'm just saying
you knew that she was your sister?
you knew? Yo?
knew we're both allergic to grass, we have the same toes, we have the same blood type.
we're the same.
I knew there was something, and I looked into it.
but I thought.
I thought that you were my soul mate. I thought that.
y-you knew and you never told me? - Because it doesn't matter.
we found each other. Out of all the people in the world, we found each other.
Oh, don't touch me. - Nothing's changed.
don't, don't, don't! - Nothing has to change!
don't touch me! Get away from me! You--this is disgusting.
you are my brother.
I had sex with you. You took my virginity.
Lisa-- Brian, it's over.
we're best friends. - It's over, Brian.
I, um.
need you.
deal with it, Coop.
you know, there's no one else I would let do this to me.
that supposed to make me feel special? - Yes.
because the only thing you need me for anymore is picking lice outta your hair?
in monkeys, it's a sign of affection.
this sucks, Cooper.
I used to like to come to work.
I used to like to talk to you, tell you everything, vice versa.
and now it just.
it all sucks.
all you do is lie.
I'm sleeping with Charlotte King.
and I didn't tell you because.
she said I couldn't, but also because-- more because-- I was scared of what you'd think.
I'm scared of what I think because I like her.
I really like her. I might almost kind of love her.
and she's mean and she won't let me tell you about her, and she's bossy and rude and all southern twangy.
and now I got lice, which I got because I don't have any patients, which Sam never fails to point out.
and do you think Charlotte would pick lice out of my head?
Charlotte would burn me alive if I came near her with lice.
and I want to dump her so hard. I want to dump her on her ass and walk away, but the idea of dumping her gives me this pain in my stomach that makes me feel like I want to vomit, so I can't dump her because of the maybe loving her.
and it is killing me not telling you.
so I'm telling you.
I'm sleeping with Charlotte King.
thank you.
I set Lisa up with an appointment to see Violet.
Brian's staying at a hotel.
I still don't think he understands what he did wrong.
Yeah, well, in his mind, they were best friends. That was more important.
Hey, officer, uh, S.W. A.T.
it's-- it's me, Addison. Addison Forbes Montgomery.
the doctor.
uh, anyway, I,Bum.
I noticed that there were a few missed calls on my cell, and, um,
I didn't know if-- if one of them might have been you. I mean, sometimes I do that.
you know, I get the voice mail, and then I debate whether or not I should leave a message.
you know, sometimes it's just better to call back later.
but, um, anyway, if you did call, uh, I'm sorry that I didn't pick up.
but then maybe you didn't call.
I think I just lost my best friend, and, um.
I needed somebody to talk to, and you just seem like such a good guy and such a good person to talk to, and I, uh.
and I.
I now am realizing that we've only gone out once, and so why would you be the person that I'm calling?
and so now I'm just this weird person leaving a message on your voice mail.
and you don't know me, so this seems really like.
I should hang up now.
nice knowing you.
what, you need the conference room for another one of your secret meetings?
Hey, Pete.
Oh, no, no, no.
you were my one bright spot.
I'm just not a-a-a defatalator.
I-- I'll-- I'll try something new, I'll even help you with the executive physicals, but the-- C-Cooper also has something that he'd like to say.
look, I'm-- I'm a pediatrician, Sam.
kids get sick, they come to me, I take care of 'em. I don't do health fairs.
I don't cold- call patients. I don't.
shill. I'm just. I'm a doctor.
this is not how we act.
it's not who we are.
we can do better. I know we can.
I know we need money, but at the end of the day, if we can't treat patients the way they should be treated, then what'the point?
I just need a little faith.
what do you want?
I did what you asked because I had convinced myself that it was the right thing to do for Kirk.
but the truth was, I was protecting the wrong person.
this isn't about protecting me. - No, I meant me.
I was protecting myself from your threat.
and that's not the kind of doctor I am.
that's not the kind of doctor that I want to be.
you asked me if it was somebody I loved, what I would do. And.
it would kill me, Charlie, but I wouldn't want to force someone to live a way that they couldn't live with, because that would be for me and not for them.
it's the only thing keeping him alive.
but that's not the life that he wants.
we haven't done everything we can here, Sam.
I understand wanting to throw everything at a problem, Charlie.
in business, maybe you do that, an-and maybe it works, but.
you end up losing a bit of yourself along the way.
and this isn't a business, Charlie.
this is your son.
uh, no, go ahead.
you're gonna forgive me eventually, nai.
it's okay.
I'm here. It's okay.
tonight's not a good night.
I told Violet about us. She was hounding me, and I told her.
I'm sorry.
I hate you. -Yeah, I hate you, too, but you do matter.
I wouldn't have told Violet if you didn't matter.
get your clothes off.
Yeah.
I know. I mean, wow.
I didn't know older guys could be so good.
older guys? -yeah.
you're, like, the oldest guy I've ever had sex with.
a patient died today. - I'm sorry.
and I am not helping the practice.
you're doing a good job.
you're just saying that.
I'm just saying that, but it's what Naomi would've said.
I have faith in you, Sam. Things will get better.
this is just a bump in the road. Before you know it, it'll be just like-- shh.
old times.
I'm furious. - I know.
I'm gonna be furious for a very long time. - I know.
this is hate sex. - I know.
my name is Lucas Scott.
four years ago, I graduated from high school with my friends.
Brooke Davis moved to New York city and found success...
Peyton Sawyer to Los Angeles.
I wrote a novel and fell for my editor, Lindsey.
recently, we've come home.
I missed you, P.Sawyer.
now Brooke's opening a local bout hue forer fashion l Peyton Sawyer is starting her own record label.
my best friend Haley started teaching...
Quentin: That is some fine ass.
who said that?
but it hasn't been easy.
Hey, man.
nor has it been easy for her husband, Nathan, who in a moment of anger, watched his dreams of playing professional basketball vanish.
you have a beautiful son who is here!
I am here!
one more night like this, Nathan, and I promise you, you will have nothing!
a lot has changed since high school...
I still love you.
I love you, too, lucas scott.
but in many ways, our journey is just beginning.
did you write all night?
Yeah.
I guess I did.
the question is, how much of it survived the dreaded "delete" button?
almost all of it.
you must be ready to pass out.
actually, I'm not tired.
I'm really energized.
the words came to me.
I haven't felt this inspired since my last book.
I'm glad.
and it's a good thing you're energized.
because you have practice in like eight minutes.
off you go, coach.
that was just mean.
you're a mean person.
you know that, yeah.
Haley, come look at this. Haley!
sorry, Haley's not here. She's at school.
um, I'm Carrie, the new
the new nanny. I know. She told me.
okay, well, I'm gonna make breakfast.
do you want me to bring you some?
no. I'm good. Thanks.
guess where I am?
you're feeling warm and fuzzy in your new office, while I'm stuck in incompetent construction worker hell?
I mean, it's like they're in slow motion.
complain all you want, but I think you're having fun. Admit it.
well, I'll admit that I'm enjoying doing something on my own...
on my own for once.
I can't wait to see Victoria's face when she sees
speak of the devil. She's on the other line.
of course.
well, good thing you're already in hell.
call me later. - Okay.
I was just about to call you.
no, you weren't.
why haven't I received your flight itinerary?
because I've decided to stay in Tree Hill a few extra days.
we're opening a new store.
I didn't approve a Tree Hill location.
that doesn't even make sense.
Brooke Davis, you are jeopardizing this company.
you're the face of the brand, and your absence can cause irreparable harm.
now, what the hell has gotten into you?
home.
are you doing drugs?
because if you are, it's okay.
I can spin this in a good way.
I have to go.
excuse me.
um, we're gonna keep this.
this belongs here.
somebody told me that this is the place where everything's better and everything's safe
did you just walk down the stairs?
if by "walking," you mean "falling."
you didn't have to come down.
I told you I'd bring you some breakfast.
s what is that?
bacon and eggs.
Yes, it's rearranged into a smiley face.
I do that sometimes.
I'm an optimist.
whatever.
um, listen, I need you to give me a ride somewhere.
do nannies do that?
sure.
I don't have to pick up Jamie for a few hours.
just... let me get your crutches.
and no more falling.
skills: Hey, pick it up, blue! Let's go!
Hey, coach, you got a sec?
that depends -- are you gonna be one of those teachers constantly complaining about my players' grades?
if your players are failing, you bet your ass I will.
Oh, fair enough.
grades are the least of this team's worries.
Oh, my god!
can't be serious.
how's Quentin? Is he still disrupting your class?
actually, no.
Quentin has not been in class all week, and I think it's because he got kicked off the team.
you can't save 'em all, Hales.
God!
I think your team looks really good.
the J. V. is the team in white.
in the blue -- yeah, those are mine.
we're a work in progress.
awkward.
I'm gonna go to class now. I'll see you later.
Haley, how's my little brother doing?
he's a work in progress.
finish!
excuse me.
I, uh, I found my demo in the trash.
perhaps you should have left it there.
I don't think so.
excuse me?
what did you just say?
look, maybe I'm not right for the job, okay?
but my audition demo doesn't belong in the trash.
I worked really hard on it.
you're right.
that was a mistake...
and I'm sorry.
I meant to put it in the recycling bin.
yo, Mouth! It's early lunch Thursday!
friends at work -- half a strike at least.
Thanks. Nice timing, by the way.
Hello, Nate.
it's good to see you, Nathan.
been a long time.
4 years.
4 years, 15 weeks, 2 days.
counting the days is kind of a popular hobby around here -- that and ceramics.
tell me about the accident.
it was a moment of anger.
I had a chance to walk away, and I didn't do it.
and now my punishment is...
I get to regret it every day for the rest of my life.
join the club.
my biggest regret's not being able to watch my grandson grow up, losing my family -- those are things you still have.
how is my grandson?
he must be getting big by now.
you got a picture of him?
I'm not here to talk about Jamie.
I understand.
I just always wondered if he knows who I am.
he found a picture of you once.
we told him that you were his grandfather.
he asked where you were.
What'd you tell him?
we told him you were dead.
can I help you with something?
sorry.
uh, no, I just thought I would lounge here while I'm on my break.
well, you know, they do have a teacher's lounge for that, right?
Oh, Luke, it's so creepy in there.
they're all acting like they're still my teachers.
I feel like I'm being graded.
you too, huh? - Yeah.
so, I hear you rented out your office space at Tric to Peyton.
Lindsey okay with that?
Yeah, why not?
I don't know.
maybe because Peyton's not just another ex-girlfriend and everybody knows that.
Haley, I'm just helping out an old friend, okay? That's all.
besides, you know, Lindsey's not really the jealous type.
good answer, because I'm having lunch with her in a few minutes.
so, this was just a sneak attack?
you're just gathering information?
Yeah, pretty much.
how did I not see this coming?
because you're a guy, Luke, and guys are...
so predictable.
skills: Girls are so predictable.
she's not a girl -- she's a woman.
she is a cougar.
well, whatever she is, she hates me, and it's getting worse every day.
that's called "sexual tension," dog.
you need to stay off the internet.
no, I'm serious.
look, last year, I had this professor, right?
she kept on riding me all semester, dog, I mean, and not in a good way.
but one day, she started bitching at me after class.
I planted one on her.
you did not.
there's no way you did that.
that's not all I did.
I'm telling you, hook it up.
you have finally lost touch with reality.
Oh, and by the way, next time you decide to stop by my work, try not to yell out "early lunch Thursday!"
okay.
I'm telling you, I think you're gonna miss out on some hot cougar love.
Oh, thank you.
said you wanted to get to know me better, but I knew right away, you were sizing me up.
Oh, I was not.
Haley, you asked me to bring a photocopy of my driver's license.
well, I was just, you know, checking to make sure you were good enough for my best friend.
I mean, Lucas had been through a lot lately, you know?
Lucas tell you he wrote all night?
no, I thought he's been blocked.
guess he got inspired.
Oh, that's good.
isn't it?
Yeah.
Yeah, as his editor, I'm thrilled, obviously, but as his girlfriend, I can't help but notice the timing.
Oh, you're talking about Peyton coming back?
I sound like a jealous girlfriend.
no, you don't.
thank you.
look, I know Lucas better than anyone does.
I'm telling you, he's very much in love with you.
Thanks, Haley.
okay, now I need you to tell me that I'm not totally insane for hiring a hot nanny.
I'm pretty sure you have more toys than any other kid on the planet.
you can play with them. I don't mind.
Thanks.
daddy doesn't like it when I play basketball.
why not?
can you keep a secret?
I'm the best at keeping secrets.
okay, but no telling.
okay.
it's good to see everybody working on their dunks, considering most of you can't even make a free throw.
you guys lost 8 games last year by 3 points or less -- 8.
now, does anyone know how many games you won by 3 points or less?
I do. Zero.
Oh, that's right -- none.
now, maybe, if you guys could've hit a few free throws, maybe you could've made the playoffs.
so, this is how we're gonna start -- fundamentals.
see this spot?
we're gonna start practice every day from this line right here.
and any player who can't step up and knock down three straight free throws in a row is gonna run all day.
who wants to prove me wrong?
go ahead and start running, superstar.
Hey, and don't be high-fiving nobody, either.
who's next?
you're late.
it's 1: 00.
no, it was 1: 00 30 seconds ago, which makes you late -- another strike.
why do you hate me so much?
Why?
you know, we gave you a fantastic opportunity here, but it's so obvious to me that you think you are above the work.
you don't want to pay your dues.
you come in late.
you pass around your worthless audition demo.
somehow, I'm a bitch because I've decided that you haven't earned it yet.
you know what?
why don't you just face the reality of the situation?
you are wasting your time here.
you are irrelevant.
you are annoying
and now you're fired.
I know it wasn't easy for you, coming here.
it means a lot to me.
I didn't come here for you.
you know, as long as I can remember, you taught me that basketball was the most important thing in the world.
so when I lost it, I thought my life was over.
Yeah, and those tools ended up preventing me from succeeding.
don't ever back down.
second place is the first loser.
do you remember that?
don't expect me to apologize for teaching you to play a game that you love, that you chose.
a game that nearly destroyed my family.
it's not worth it, and my family's all I have now.
that's why I'll never let my son play.
basketball's taken enough.
you're not on those crutches 'cause I handed you a basketball when you were 3.
and trust me -- you not letting your son play is just as bad as you making him play.
and that's why you're here -- to blame me for what happened to you.
no.
I've been sitting at home for four months blaming you, and now I'm done.
it's time to move on.
I'm letting go of the anger, and I'm letting go of you.
I just had to look you in the eye when I told you that.
I won't be back.
don't you see, Nathan?
the strength you need to let go of it, to leave your old man behind
that's what I taught you.
lesson learned.
I love you, son.
this is officially the coolest office I've ever been in.
uh, yeah.
now I just need to sign a couple bands and prove to myself it wasn't all a big mistake.
from what I've heard about you, I don't think that's gonna be a problem.
well, I hope you're right.
Oh, uh, this is for you.
it's supposed to bring good luck.
it's a lucky bamboo.
they don't need much sunlight.
just make sure you water it every day.
I will. Thank you.
well, I hope it all works out.
I know we just met, but I just wanted you to know that I'm here.
good to know.
Bye, Peyton.
are you telling me not one of them made their free throws?
let's just put it this way -- we could have built a new gym with all them bricks.
you know they're counting on us to turn this thing around, right, this season?
they'll get better. - Yeah?
well, if they don't, maybe we can start a track team.
come on! Keep going!
run, run, run! Pick it up!
Hey, how'd you get home?
took a cab.
you took an hour-long cab ride?
that must have cost a fortune.
I would have picked you up.
no, don't worry about it.
I get the handicap discount.
you'd think, in this town, they'd have a state championship discount.
I went to Pontiac.
you beat us in the championship game.
I cried for a week.
sorry.
so, how does it feel to be a hometown hero?
I'm not that guy anymore, all right?
trust me -- I'm nobody's hero.
you sure about that?
looks like you're somebody's hero.
I promised my mom I'd send her a photo once you got finished destroying her caf?
okay, that's not fair. I hated doing it.
but I kept the sign.
well, I'll make sure I mention it in my e-mail.
so, what made you want to open up a shop here in Tree Hill?
same reason you're coaching the Ravens.
it's home.
and it's good to be home.
what do you think?
I got to be honest -- I think it's the perfect way to continue the legacy of Karen's caf?
I'm just amazed at how quickly you got this place together.
you're very impressive, Brooke Davis.
Yeah, that's what they tell me.
so, is it everything you imagined?
having your own fashion line?
today it is.
ask me again tomorrow.
Hey, so this is it, huh? You're doing it.
Yeah, well, hopefully, it's just the beginning.
wow, well, I can say I was here when it all started.
maybe I should steal something to commemorate the occasion.
well, if there's no stopping you...
bamboo.
lucky bamboo.
it was from Lindsey.
Lucas' Lindsey?
is that, like, her nickname or something?
this is actually really nice of her.
suspiciously nice.
Oh, stop it. Keep this.
it really did just feel like she was coming over here to mark her territory, you know?
and then she said,"I just wanted you to know I'm here."
so she was letting you know that, if you need anything, she's here to help.
she was letting me know she's not going anywhere.
I got to be honest with you.
that just really doesn't sound like her, but, I mean, even if she is doing that and marking her territory, what difference does it make?
it's not like you came back to town for Lucas, right?
no.
I did not come back here for Lucas -- I came back here for me.
good. That's what I thought.
great sound check.
Yeah, really great.
they're local...
and they're unsigned.
you can tell that just by looking at them?
Oh, well, four years in L. A. at least gave me that.
well, what do you think?
I love the house, especially the furniture.
I love the coffee table.
Oh, we found that in Greece two summers ago.
I want it.
you... want the coffee table?
I want everything -- the house, the furniture, and if you can be gone in an hour, I'll throw in an extra $30, 000.
enjoy your new house!
you didn't want Beasley, did you?
no. You can keep beasley.
there's a roast in the oven.
I love roast.
Bye.
you must be lost.
uh, no, actually, I've spent more time on this court than you ever will.
I want you to come back to school.
ain't nothing left for me up there.
isn't anything left.
and there's more to life than basketball, Quentin.
I mean, you got to graduate.
what's it matter to you?
listen to me.
half the kids that drop out of high school have no job, and the ones that do earn a job earn 25% less than the kids that stayed in school and 63% less than the ones that graduated college.
so, for me, it doesn't matter, but for you, Quentin, it matters a lot.
I'm not kidding.
or maybe you're just hot for me, Mrs. James Scott.
all right, I tried.
thank you for meeting with me.
what is this about?
um, well, I think you guys are really great.
look, I'm kind of tired, so if this is just some fan-club crap
Oh, no, no, no. I'm sorry.
please, um, sit down.
I own my own record label, and I would really love to sign you guys.
why should we sign with you?
well, I was in L. A. for the last four years working at a major label, but I decided to leave because I thought I could do better on my own.
and when I hear bands like yours, I know I can.
the majors are a mess right now, and so, if you sign with me,
I'm gonna do everything I can to make sure you guys get to be where you want to be.
so, what other bands do you have?
as of right now?
I mean, there's nobody yet.
uh, I wanted you guys to be my first.
look, my ex-girlfriend told me the same thing prom night.
she was a lying bitch.
we're gonna pass, but thanks.
lucky bamboo.
Peyton. You just missed Lucas.
uh, actually, I came by to see you.
great. What's up?
why did you bring me that lucky bamboo?
well, I just - no, I'll tell you why
you were marking your territory, and that's okay. I get it.
but for the record, I am not after Lucas, okay?
I didn't think you were.
well, then, what do you want?
cause, seriously, people are just not that nice.
Peyton, my whole life, I wanted to be an editor, so when I made it, a friend of mine gave me a lucky bamboo for my office.
now, I'm not naive enough to think that I found my way because of some plant on my desk, but that plant was a symbol that I had finally made it.
that's all I was trying to give you a reminder of the first day you started living your dream.
it's good to know you're not after Lucas.
good luck.
man, you ain't gonna believe this.
I guess they got tired of running.
or they just got tired of losing.
nice work, coach.
you too, coach.
how's the physical therapy going?
it hurts.
good. No pain, no gain.
you sound like my dad.
sorry.
I used to be a personal trainer.
I am full of motivational catch phrases.
that's who you were visiting yesterday at the prison -- it was your dad, right?
I'd rather not talk about it.
does Haley know you went to see him?
no, she doesn't.
and I'd like to keep it that way.
I'm not here to meddle.
unless I'm invited in, I mind my own business.
but if she asks me, I won't lie.
that's fair.
and listen, um, it's good that you're here.
I've pretty much been a jackass for the past few months, and Haley deserves better.
I know it's been really hard on her.
you know, if you want to do something nice for Haley, you might want to try investing in a razor.
so, maybe I don't have any other bands.
there's something my label has that the others don't -- me.
and I have a lot of experience, more than you'd think.
and the other thing that I have that none of the other labels have is an interest in you guys.
now, I can have you in a recording studio tomorrow.
so if it is really about the music, you might want to reconsider.
have a good show.
before I go, I need to say something.
of course you do.
you're like a bug that can't be squashed.
you never gave me a chance.
you hated me from the start because of how I look.
it's always about how people look.
I mean, take you.
you dress all uptight, hiding your hot body behind your cold personality.
but at the end of the day, you know you got it.
you know, go hire your hot anchor and hang out with your hot friends and be hot, but you'll never know what you're missing,'cause I'm good at what I do, and I'm gonna prove you wrong.
that was kind of hot. - Yeah.
tough day? - Yeah.
I can't remember the last one that wasn't.
I just think I'm realizing that I can't help everybody, and I still somehow feel responsible.
I don't know why I keep trying.
maybe I'm avoiding this -- you know, coming home.
that's such a terrible thing to say, I know. It just hasn't been easy.
well, you should go inside.
there's someone waiting to see you.
jamie -- he's such a good boy, isn't he?
Bye. - Bye. Thank you.
Where'd you go, jimjams?
what is this?
it's the beginning.
of what?
of the way it's gonna be from now on.
I know that it's gonna take a lot more than dinner...
but I figured it's a start, right?
I've missed you.
so, how was your day?
Oh, enough about me. How was your day?
Yeah, how was your day, mama?
Oh, my day just got a lot better.
well, I can't vouch for any of this, because Jamie made it all.
Oh, no.
Brooke, this place looks great.
think, if I can't sign any bands soon, maybe I can get a job here?
I'm sorry, darling, you're not nearly bitchy enough to work in one of my stores.
Oh, I don't know about that.
I have references. Just ask Lindsey.
Lucas' lLindsey?
does everyone call her that?
were you mean to her?
no, she was marking her territory, and I just called her on it.
she thinks I'm after Lucas.
she said that?
she didn't have to -- it was obvious.
she showed up with this, like, bad-luck bamboo thing and a story about how it was, like, a symbol of my dream, but I'm pretty sure it was just to guilt-trip me.
Peyton --and then -- get this
she says to me,"I just want you to know, I'm here."
what is that?
I mean, you're opening up your own store, and does she bring you a lucky bamboo?
I'm such a bitch.
look on the bright side -- now I'd hire you to work in one of my stores in a second.
no, really, I suck.
Yeah, you do.
matter of fact, it's a wonder that you have any friends at all, but you do.
come with me.
so, the entire class stands up, and I said,"any student that walks out that door fails this quarter."
you didn't say that. - I totally did.
you're like the mean teacher.
that's kind of hot.
well, well, don't you think it's a little past your bedtime, mister?
I think so.
Hey, I'll tell you what -- since it's a special occasion,
I think we should stay up a little later tonight, unless you're too tired.
no, I'm not tired!
here.
I was thinking maybe we could go outside and shoot around with this thing.
is that something you'd like to do with me?
I don't know.
hmm, yeah. I don't really know, either.
no, no, no! Play!
all right, well, let's see you're ready. Show me your jump shot.
nice! Nice.
use that follow-through.
there you go.
surprise.
you rented a house?
well, not exactly.
Brooke, you did not just buy this house.
what are you thinking?
what -- you don't like it?
no, it's incredible!
good,'cause that's your room.
your son left this for you earlier.
one more time.
beautiful. That was awesome.
you'll be doing that on 10-foot baskets someday.
all right, give me some more.
nice!
so, we're gonna give you a chance. Don't let us down.
I won't.
I've been putting on a brave face for a few weeks now.
you have these two gorgeous ex-girlfriends back in town, and I'm trying so hard to be okay with it, but I have to ask you a question, and I promise, I'll never ask it again.
should I be worried about us?
I love you.
that is never gonna change.
you have nothing to worry about.
Hey, you know what?
I just thought of something.
what if Lucas' Lindsey gave you a lucky bamboo because she was marking her territory with you, too?
let it go.
I'm calling her "Lucas' Lindsey" now. God.
look at the view.
look, this place is beautiful, but...
But?
I just worry I'm keeping you from your life.
I know you came down here for me.
you know, in New York, I had everything I thought I wanted -- money, celebrity, success.
but you know what I didn't have?
sunrise with my best friend.
well, isn't that sweet?
what are you doing here?
well, when you stupidly charge a house to the company, we have to confirm the address.
vacation's over.
it's time to get back to work.
forget it. I'm staying here.
stop being a spoiled brat.
there's a flight in a few hours.
I will be on it, and you will be sitting next to me.
no, I'm not going back.
Brooke. - Mother.
I'll see you on the plane, my dutiful daughter.
goodbye, Peyton.
goodbye, Mrs. Davis.
well, your mom's still a bitch.
what are you gonna do?
my name is Michael Westen. I used to be a spy until -
we got a burn notice on you. You're blacklisted.
when you're burned, you've got nothing: No cash, no credit, no job history.
you're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in.
where am I? - Miami.
you do whatever work comes your way.
you rely on anyone who's still talking to you:
a trigger-happy girlfriend... - Should we shoot them?
an old friend who used to inform on you to the FBI...
you know spies. Bunch of bitchy little girls.
family too. - Hey, is that your mom again?
if you're desperate. - Someone needs your help, Michael.
and a down-and-out spy you met along the way.
that's how we do it, people.
bottom line, as long as you're burned, you're not going anywhere.
it's a deep cover job. We're going after the leader of a terrorist network.
you used to work with this son of a bitch.
you're on a path, Michael. All will be revealed in time.
two hour notice to get to Cuba to bust somebody out of a Russian black site?
can you take care of the guards in here, get her out?
she is all that matters. It's been an honor, Mike.
Jesus.
Where's Mike?
she's still unconscious, but
no, no, no - Jesse?
he's all right. He's breathing.
she's gone. - Mike, what do we do now?
find her.
tracking someone in the wilderness isn't just about the occasional footprint or broken branch.
it's about using what you find to put yourself in the head of the person you're hunting.
if your target isn't completely careless, most signs you'll find will be small, almost invisible.
just a bit of disturbed earth or a bent branch.
she didn't go east. It's too dense.
with all that mud, it would lead us right to her.
this way's a bust too. She'd have to circle around to get through.
take a look at that.
of course, sometimes you do find something more obvious, which makes the trail that much easier to follow or that much harder.
okay. Now we're on to something.
okay, check it out. Looks like she fell right here.
she's getting tired. She's probably heading for the road. Come on, we can catch her.
wait. - Mike, we can't wait.
seriously, she runs like a cheetah. If she gets to the road
look at that. For two miles, we don't see a footprint.
now she leaves tracks a cub scout could follow? - What are you saying?
I'm saying I think she's hiding.
waiting to double back after we pass.
Mike, we're talking about someone who was just tortured in a black site. She's still drugged up.
I don't-- - then look at that.
the broken branch. If she went to the road, who went that way?
Oh, son of a bitch.
I think she's behind us. We should circle back.
I got a better idea. You circle back, Jesse and I keep going, - make her think she fooled us. - Sell it.
well, there we go, that branch. I think that's the right way here.
Yeah, I think she's heading for the road.
drop it, now.
Sonya, you don't wanna do this. I'm on your side.
I know who you are, Michael Westen.
take off your laces now. Make a wrong move, I'll shoot you.
that's a nice trick, sending your friends towards the road.
you don't understand. We're here to rescue you.
rescue me or take me someplace worse.
I know the Americans hate me as much as the Russians do.
I don't know what you've heard about me, but that's the past.
I no longer work for the CIA.
I was working with Randall Burke. - You worked with Randall?
he found me drinking myself to death in Santo Domingo.
he cleaned me up. He gave me a job.
we found the man who sold you to the Russians, and then we came after you.
you keep saying "we, " but I don't see Randall. Where is he?
he didn't make it out. He sacrificed himself to save you.
he's gone. I'm sorry. - He's dead?
that's convenient for you, isn't it?
my friend is dead, and the three of you can tell any story you want.
it's not a story. It's the truth. He was my friend too
he was more than a friend. He saved me.
now I don't have any proof to offer you, but I know why I'm here
because Burke gave me a purpose. He said I was part of something, that I was on a path, and I chose to believe him.
now the question is whether you choose to believe me.
Hey, Sam and Jesse. Feel like coming down to Cuba?
sure, Mike, sounds great. "Hope we get to hike through the woods. Forever.
not forever, Sam. The boat should be just up ahead.
Yeah, assuming it's still there.
we lost a lot of time on that little detour.
hold on. Looks like the Cuban police showed up.
well, I guess the good news is the boat is still there.
we just can't get to it.
we still have some C4. We could give the cops something to investigate, make it over to the seawall, and swim for the boat.
even if we get past the police, they've already called in their position.
Cuban gunships are probably headed here already.
Burke left you some clothes. We could drive up the coastline, try to get ahead of the manhunt.
it won't matter. They're going to lock down the entire island.
so I guess your proposal is to what, live in the Cuban wilderness for the rest of our lives?
there's a smuggler I know. Ruben Hernandez.
he has a cigar shop on the southern edge of Havana.
he runs guns in and out of every port in the Caribbean.
does he move people as well? - Not usually, but I can be persuasive.
okay, it looks like that place has been closed for years, so her friend could be dead or in prison
or Sonya's leading us into a trap.
I know she whacked you on the head. - No, it's not that-- I mean...
that pissed me off a little bit. I'm not gonna lie. That pissed me off.
but listen, when I was in CIFA, there was a rumor about a deep cover Russian mole working around Arlington.
blonde hair, in her 20s, spoke flawless English.
wait a minute, I heard about her. She turned the NSA inside out.
Yeah, and the information she sent home got a lot of good agents killed.
now if Sonya's that operative, it's only a matter of time before she stabs us in the back.
well, then we won't turn our backs.
Mike, you know what, maybe it's best that we just shove her in the trunk of a car - and call the CIA... - Amen to that.
cause I'll tell you one thing, the Russians didn't throw her in a black site for shoplifting.
that's not how this works, Sam. My mission isn't to grab one person, it's to take down a terrorist network, and right, now she is the only link to that network.
now if you guys want out, I understand, but I have to see this through one way or another.
no, we're in, but after this is over, Mike,
I want a thank-you note from the CIA director. And a fruit basket.
Ruben's still in business. He'll be here this afternoon.
Sam, Jesse, switch out this car before the police find it.
michael and I will wait inside.
Mike, you sure you wanna split up? Because if you guys are seen...
we'll keep a low profile. It'll be fine, Sam.
shotgun.
when you've spent too much time working with spies, trust doesn't come easy.
even when you're dealing with someone you care about, you're always on the lookout for signs of deception.
because you never know whether you're just spotting white lies...
or something darker.
what's up? - That's what I wanna know.
what are you talking about?
why did you tell Lou we'd take this job in New Orleans?
the money's not good, and the trail is two days old.
no, it's not. Lou just - Don't lie to me!
I will not be lied to.
no secrets.
fi... I-I wasn't lying about anything. Okay?
I just didn't tell you the whole story.
here's the deal. Ever since Michael came back you've had this, you know, this different look in your eye.
so I figured, I don't know, trip away for a few days might help clear your head.
that's all.
it's just when I walked up you--you hung up your phone.
I was just making hotel reservations. You wanna check my phone?
come on a trip with me.
a few days. It'll be fun.
just how much fun?
lots of fun.
well, it's just for a couple of weeks. Will you and Charlie be okay?
I'm sure, Fiona. As long as you're here for his birthday.
we're doing dinosaurs and trains.
Madeline, I'm gonna have to call you back.
I didn't see anything in your file about being a painter, but I gotta tell you, this is impressive. What do you call it?
I call it "Shoot intruders on sight."
it explores my feelings about having the CIA break into my house repeatedly.
I was expecting something a little bit more whimsical.
get out.
I'll be happy to leave, but we have to talk first.
I've heard that you're thinking about getting out of town.
Oh, you're spying on me too.
if by "spying" you mean monitoring my operative's closest known associates, then yes.
look, here's the deal. This is a very crucial point for Michael in his mission.
he's gonna need all the help he can get going forward. I need you here.
I don't care what you need. I don't wanna be involved.
you already are involved.
you kidnapped a Russian diplomat, for God's sake.
Yeah, well that was for Michael, not the CIA. And it was a one-time favor.
you know that, I know that. The people he's chasing don't.
they think that you're one of Michael's top assets in Miami. You're part of his cover now.
which means we can use you when Michael comes back to Miami.
too bad. I'm not interested. - Get interested.
this is a matter of national security.
I was hoping that you would just help us out voluntarily, but you don't really have a choice.
you let yourself in. You can let yourself out. I have a trip to shop for.
you can't just walk away from this, Ms. Glenanne.
no? Watch me.
forget about it. They're not letting even a pineapple leave the ports without inspection tonight, all right?
smuggling four people? Imposible.
you must have other avenues out of the country or other contacts.
Ruben, I want you to remember a few years back when U. S.customs somehow overlooked those shipments into San Juan.
it happened because I helped you.
if I decide to hurt you, things will go differently. Very differently.
okay, listen. There's a freighter leaving the port tonight.
the cargo's already been loaded.
if and this is a big if - Make it happen.
we might have to put that escape plan on hold. Look.
cops are here. - Those aren't just cops.
that's state security.
Oi, oi, no, no, no, no. No, not that way. If you break the window, they'll know you're here.
I have a hidden room in here.
open the door!
I'm coming. I'm coming.
just wait a minute.
good afternoon officers.
how can I help you today?
Buenas.
mind if we speak English? My Spanish is not so good.
of course, of course, uh, Seniora...
Colonel Oksana Zhirkov of the Russian GRU.
Oksana. She's been after me since I left Moscow.
we are looking for a woman you worked with a few years ago.
Sonya Lebedenko. - Sonya?
Si, Sonya, but I haven't seen Sonya in a long time.
wasn't she headed back to Russia?
no, no, no, give Ruben a chance to talk his way out of it. He's good.
this is just in case she's better.
she is in Cuba with an American. They're looking to get off the island.
given your past together, I figure this would be her first stop.
she's a clever girl. I'm sure she expected you to come to me as well and stayed away.
or perhaps they did come here without your knowledge?
they could have hidden in a crate due to be shipped out soon.
I doubt that very much because nobody comes into my warehouse without me knowing.
I trust you, senior, but do you mind if my men look around a bit?
no, no, of course not.
search the warehouse.
search the crates.
you seem nervous. - No, it's it's just the merchandise here is very valuable.
I'm sure.
tell me something. You know Sonya.
if she didn't come here, where would she go?
when she was in Havana, she, uh...
she knew this guy at Marina Tarara.
it's east of the city. A lot of pleasure yachts dock there.
do you remember the contact's name at the Marina?
eh, Eduardo. He-he would rent boats to tourists.
find anything?
nothing.
all right. You've been very helpful.
we'll be on our way.
if I hear anything I'll contact you.
but please, uh, Colonel, please take this. For you.
thank you.
one more thing, Senior Hernandez.
I noticed something interesting while we were talking.
whenever my associates walked near that wall you completely forgot about your cigar.
in fact, you held your breath.
I wonder why a weapons smuggler would have a warehouse with no weapons.
it occurs to me a hidden room would be very convenient for hiding guns or people.
or I just sent a shipment out, and for the moment I only have cigars.
lying is such hard work. And it's pointless now.
just tell me the truth, and this will all be over.
where is the hidden door?
it's the middle panel. There's a little latch on the bottom.
thank you.
they're behind the wall. I want them alive.
move.
take over!
get down!
grenade!
run!
take cover!
cover me.
go.
how's it look out there?
Oh, you know. Classic cars, good music, crumbling infrastructure.
Oh, and you two are the stars of a nationwide manhunt.
Yeah, airports sealed off. Ports are locked up tight.
even the hotels are doing room checks.
Oksana is the agency's best.
back when I knew her, an MI6 agent was made in Estonia.
he had a two-day head start to get out of the country. Oksana found and killed him by dinnertime.
there might be one card we can play.
she hasn't seen me and Jesse yet. Maybe we can approach her.
that could work. We tell her we're hunting for Mike.
pitch her on joining forces. If we can get her to show us where she's deploying her men, maybe we can find a hole.
or create one. You still have the bug we used at the black site?
Yeah, I'll just put it in my watch.
you two are going to walk into Oksana's headquarters and lie to her?
pretty much, yeah.
let me remind you, she is the head of counterintelligence for the GRU.
there's no one better at seeing through tricks like this.
I know a little bit about counterintelligence myself. - You don't know Oksana.
you make one wrong move, and she kills you and captures us.
Sonya, you saw Oksana at the warehouse yesterday. She's reading right out of your playbook.
if we just try to run, how long do you think we'll last?
sending Sam and Jesse in might be dangerous, but right now it's the best move we have.
all right, keep your heads down. Let's see what we can do.
when you're trying to escape surveillance, the first step is spotting it.
you're on the lookout for people who won't make eye contact, figures sitting in parked cars, or faces you've seen more than once.
if you can't determine how you're being watched, the best move is to change locations as soon as possible.
you all set? - Yeah.
you okay? What's wrong?
nothing, I'm just looking forward to our trip.
Yeah, me too. Let's get on the road.
of course, sometimes the reason you can't figure out how they're watching - is that they're done watching. - Fiona Glenanne, you're under arrest.
what the hell? What are you talking about? Un -under arrest for what?
two counts of criminal trespassing. 1712 Laguna Way.
What-are you kidding me? We're chasing a bail jumper, man.
we work for these guys. - No, it's not what you think.
well, it looks like your girlfriend cut some corners - No, no, no, no. Let me tell you something, okay?
I was there for that takedown. She did nothing wrong.
you want to arrest somebody, you arrest me.
I'll be happy to take you two, if that's what you want.
Carlos, you don't wanna get involved in this.
okay? - Come on.
Hey, this--this has got to be some kinda mistake, okay? It's gonna be fine, I promise.
let's go.
see ya in a bit, okay?
russia and Cuba aren't as tight as they were in the Cold War, but their law enforcement agencies still cooperate closely.
if you're looking for a Russian officer running a manhunt in Havana, there's a good chance they're operating out of a local police station.
which means the problem isn't finding them.
it's that they'll have an entire country's resources at their disposal.
hi there!
who is in charge of the manhunt?
come with us.
sorry to keep you waiting, gentlemen. I'm Colonel Oksana Zhirkov.
my men found the abandoned sedan that you reported. Thank you.
no problem.
that car's not all we can find.
my name's Chuck Finley. This is my partner, Virgil Tibbs. We're bounty hunters.
if there's money on someone's head, we track down that head.
we're currently after one Michael Westen. - I know who Michael Westen is.
good. Then you know he's on the run with someone you're after. Sonya Lebedenko?
we're thinking we team up, help each other out.
I see. Very interesting.
what other information do you have?
we're gathering information all the time.
just this morning we tracked down one of their discarded burner cells, found some of the places they've stayed.
so in other words... You have nothing.
excuse me? - You have no useful leads.
no real chance of catching them. I didn't fly in from Moscow to do your job for you.
what? No. No, no, no, that's not it at all.
see, we've been nipping at Westen's heels.
we know how he thinks. - I'm sure you do.
my associate will take down anything else you have to say.
tell Rolando to be thorough.
okay, listen, my Russian might be a little rusty, - but it sounds like you're having us worked over. - Call it what you like.
I told you this was a bad idea. Give me your phone.
have you lost your mind? You can't just lock us up!
hold on, that's my phone.
that's my phone. That could be information about Westen.
are you really gonna pass up a lead? Let the man answer his phone.
this is Virgil. Talk to me.
if you want to live, do as I say.
what do you have?
tell Oksana you're using Cuban locals to find us.
political dissidents who only talk to you.
then tell her exactly where we are.
you're serious?
it's this, or Oksana has you tortured.
thank you. Talk to you soon.
well, let's hear it. - Oh, now you wanna chat?
now she wants to chat.
I'm not saying a damn thing until your buddies back off.
you're bluffing. There's no way you found something my men didn't.
I have all the police in the region.
well, we have sources that won't talk to the police, folks who aren't fans of the current regime. Folks who are helping Westen run.
exactly. We got a whole network out there, and if you want to take advantage of it, no more goons.
we're partners on this manhunt.
fine. If you offer me something useful,
I will allow you to assist with our investigation.
okay, then. Michael and Sonya were spotted at a bodega in Miramar.
our guy followed them down the road to an abandoned bunker.
Oh, oh, uh, wow. Are you sure?
Yep. - You sure?
Yeah, I'm sure. I'm sure.
avenida allende. Right outside of town.
you heard him. Avenida Allende!
send all the cars in the area.
they'll be here in about five minutes.
tell me you have a way to block off this road. - I'm working on it.
if you need to create a roadblock in a hurry, the steel frames of old cars make an excellent barrier.
the challenge is moving that much metal without a tow truck.
what you need is a directed explosion.
if you make sure that the shockwave from your C4 can't head down or sideways, the only way it can go is up.
you said five minutes. - They drove fast. Let's go!
and the more contained the blast, the higher it will send a car flying.
there's no way you're gonna get the
I stand corrected.
as a spy, there's nothing better than gaining access to your enemy's war room.
you can identify their weaknesses, see where they're deploying their forces, and if you play your cards right, you can even create an escape route for your friends.
so everything else seems pretty much locked down tight, but the airport concerns me.
now look, if we double up at the VIP entrance and the employee entrance...
you might have a fighting chance there. - No.
I'm not going to play a guessing game and risk giving Sonya and Westen a clear path onto the tarmac.
the airport is secure.
okay.
uh, whoa! Whoa, are those fuel trucks?
completely unguarded? - Oh, you've seen Westen in action.
you're basically giving him a pack of matches here.
I can't devote manpower to guarding fuel trucks the entire day.
there's no way he could even reach them. - He wouldn't have to.
he could just put an old car in drive and send it in like a missile.
or... you borrow some guards from the perimeter here.
have 'em hide behind the trucks, rifles ready.
Sonya and Westen go anywhere near those trucks, it's game over.
fine, we will move some men.
three policemen off the perimeter. That doesn't help us.
planes are still heavily guarded and there's no path to them that doesn't get us cut down from three directions.
then we don't head to the planes on the tarmac.
we try to make it over to the hangar there where there's only a single guard.
I assume you know that "mantenimiento" means maintenance.
we'll find something flyable. A plane that needs a little work might be our only option right now.
and how are we going to cross that open field without the guards spotting us?
we're not. You see those cargo containers at the edge of the airfield?
we'll get 'em to come to us.
you're not going to kill him? It's risky to leave him
trust me. We'll be long gone before anyone finds him.
you know, we studied you in training.
everybody thought you were a monster.
but for somebody with so many missions your body count was abnormally low, - and there were a lot of theories about why. - Yeah, like what?
my instructor thought it was a terror tactic.
that you left people breathing to tell horror stories and spread your legend.
what did you think?
I realized that you only kill when it is absolutely necessary.
see, after a while, I could look at a diagram of one of your operations and predict who you would let live.
so your theory was that I was noble? - Or just weak.
let's go.
Glenanne. Your lawyer's here. - It's about time.
it's you.
I actually have a law degree, for what it's worth.
we need to talk, Ms. Glenanne.
I was hoping to resolve this more quickly, but you don't make things easy, do you?
I told you I'm not interested in helping you or the CIA.
and I told you you can't run away. You are either out there helping me or you are in here doing whatever it is you do in here.
I want nothing to do with him. And I want nothing to do with his mission.
well, you should. You know the deal I made with Michael.
your freedom depends on him doing - Getting exactly what he wanted in the first place.
working for the CIA.
I think maybe Michael left out a few details.
what do you mean?
this is about a lot more than him getting his old job back.
this deal... Is mission specific.
if he fails to take down this terror network you, your friends, his mother
you all go back to prison for a long, long time.
now he didn't mention that?
no.
well, maybe he wanted to protect you.
maybe he wanted to go it alone.
frankly, it doesn't matter what he wanted because he works for me, and he needs help with this thing.
when this mission is done, I want out, free and clear, no matter what Michael does.
welcome aboard.
if you have no choice but to fly a plane in need of repair, it's better to focus on what's necessary than what's ideal.
airplane technology may be complex, but the physics of flying are simple.
if you don't mind throwing away the safety manual all you need are wings, a running engine, and workable controls.
all right, this plane is getting us out of here. - This one?
looks like it's in the middle of heart surgery.
they're replacing the magnetic electric generators.
and those are for decoration? - We don't need the backup.
I can have this plane ready to fly in 30 minutes.
call the tower, try to get us clearance. - I'll see what I can do.
Hello, it's Maria. In maintenance.
I called on the 15th to get cleared for a test run on Runway 2?
rafael said it was all set.
would you please check again?
look, I just need permission for a little bit.
yes?
yo. I don't like the looks of that. - Yeah, me neither.
we just found Westen and Sonya at the airport.
what? No, no, that's impossible.
we just got a tip that they were spotted in Matanzas.
your tip is wrong. I asked the airport tower to report any unexpected activity.
they just got a request from a maintenance hangar that was supposed to be dark today.
so no one's seen him. You're basing all this on a phone call. It could have come from anyone.
then tell me why the guard closest to that hangar is missing.
they're in there. I know it.
we leave in five minutes.
she found us. They're on their way.
is the plane ready? - Close enough.
we gotta get the doors open.
wait, wait, wait, wait.
it's too late. They're already here.
they'll breach through the front and the back doors.
the moment they do, we blow a hole in the wall, we make a run for it.
it won't work. I know Oksana.
she'll bring reinforcements, and they won't breach until they have an army surrounding the place.
we need to make it to the trees. Once there, if we can get to our car, we have a chance.
I won't take that chance. - Sonya, you wanna stay here and die?
I cannot get captured again.
we wait by the barrels and when they come in, we go down fighting!
you don't understand. - No, you don't understand!
they tortured me for two solid weeks, and I held out.
I can't do it again.
and if I break we lose everything, and I won't betray my friends.
they're in a hanger at the airport.
grab your weapons. We're heading over there.
okay, the whole force is heading to the airport.
we're gonna be outnumbered by, like, 50 to 1.
hold on, I might have something. I've been listening to the radio.
no one's actually seen Mike and Sonya at the hangar yet.
maybe we can convince Oksana they're attacking this place instead.
a fake attack? - Yeah.
I like it. You think there's enough C4 left in the car?
I hope so.
buy me some time. I'm gonna go make some bad things happen.
let's go get this son of a bitch. Come on!
when you're simulating an attack on an enemy, it's more important to create fear than to do any real damage.
you can distribute your explosives for maximum effect.
you wanna use a variety of weapons to suggest multiple attackers.
and after that, all you need is a good place to hide when the action starts.
Colonel, we need to talk. - Not now. We are heading out.
this is critical. Now listen, when we approach the hangar, - Virgil and I need the helicopters in - There are no helicopters.
you're going after Westen with no eyes in the sky? The man is like a caged tiger.
you push him into a corner, he's just gonna rip our faces off.
I'm confident our faces will
what the hell was that?
Virgil! What the hell?
my partner's dead. They just killed Virgil. Oh, my God.
who? - Michael and Sonya.
they're outside the station right now. - That's not possible.
they are at the airport trapped in a hangar.
did you just see that fireball? That was my car! They just blew up my partner!
they're coming for us, and they're gonna kill us all.
no. My men have them surrounded.
your men fell for some kind of a trick.
I'm telling you, they're standing on our doorstep, and we're sitting ducks in here!
you're wrong. We need to head for the airport.
attention, attention. This is Michael Westen. I need to speak to Colonel Zhirkov.
they have one of our radios. - Yeah, I guess they do.
are you listening? I am outside with an old friend of yours.
Hello, Oksana. It's been a long time. We should catch up...
pick up the radio, Colonel. Don't make me ask again.
what the hell are you doing? Talk to the man.
this is Colonel Zhirkov. You want to talk, let's talk.
all right, that wasn't so hard.
I want your men to step outside and lay down their weapons.
I don't think you're in a position to make demands, Mr. Westen. There are two of you.
I have a police station full of men. - For now.
get over to the window, find him, and put him down.
no, no, no. He's gonna see your sniper.
do I have to pick off your men one by one like your sniper in the window? I'm done playing games!
call your men back from the airport and buy us some time until they get here.
call the commander at the airport. Send the men back here. Now!
Hello? Is anybody there?
there is no need for further bloodshed, Mr. Westen.
I'm sure we can make a deal of some sort. Just tell me what you want.
it worked. They're leaving.
what about your friend?
what do I want?
I want the bastard who tried to catch me. The one with the chin.
you see? I told you he was insane.
send him out the front door.
if he turns around, shoot him. - How can you do this to me?
I was helping you! - Let's go.
Colonel, don't hand me off to them. They'll kill me.
you told me to buy time.
guys, you don't wanna do this, believe me.
I got kids and a dog.
out. - Fine. My blood is on your hands.
Hey, nice fake attack. - Yeah, nothing to it.
all right, let's do it.
look, I promise you two, it's--it's nothing personal.
you gotta believe me. I mean, we're-- we're just doing a job.
look, if you wanna walk away, I won't stop you.
wait, wait. No. What are you doing? No, no, please! Don't--don't kill me!
no
Bravo. You're a master thespian.
let's get to the airport before the entire Cuban military shows up.
nice. That's a start. Next I want $1 million U. S.
a million U. S. ? that will take time.
you got 20 minutes. - You'll get your money.
sounds like he's keeping her busy. - Still gonna be tight. Hop in.
Yeah, and one more thing.
we need new passports. We need them now, or we unleash hell.
I'm afraid we'll be the ones unleashing hell, Mr. Westen.
we have your position completely surrounded.
if you want to negotiate, hand over Sonya, and I'll spare you.
come on, let's go!
Mr. Westen, live to fight another day.
I'll give you the money, the passports. I only want Sonya.
hand her over to me, and I'll even give you the plane.
that's quite generous, Oksana... but we already have a plane.
they're at the airport! Stop them by any means necessary.
let's go!
tray tables up. Here they come.
Yeah, uh, hey, Lou, listen.
uh, something came up, man. Just a-a slight delay.
it's nothing, all right?
uh, I gotta call you back.
Hey, what happened? They wouldn't say anything.
they wouldn't give me any information. - Well, they dropped the charges.
it's a long story.
all right, well, you'll tell me on the road? Uh, I just bought us some time with Lou.
as long as we get to New Orleans by the morning, the job's still ours.
I'll drive first.
okay. You can drive first.
I can't go, Carlos. I'm sorry.
why can't you go, Fiona?
you just said the charges were dropped.
well, our lawyer didn't get me out.
okay, so who did?
the CIA. - The CIA.
so this is about Michael.
he's on his way back to Miami, and they're forcing me to help him until the mission's over.
I thought we were moving on with our lives, Fiona. - So did I.
look, I was hoping I could put this behind me like it never happened, but it did.
wiping the slate clean's gonna take some work.
and what do you expect me to do, hmm?
sit around and wait? What about us?
I'm doing this for us!
don't say that, okay? Don't you dare say that.
I-I--look, Fiona, I don't want this. I don't want this.
Carlos. - What?
look, until I deal with my past, I-I can't be with you. I
and I really wanna be with you.
please tell me you understand.
no. I don't understand.
but I trust you.
so if you say this is what you have to do, then...
okay. I'm with you.
thank you.
you know, I didn't think air travel could be worse than my flight out of Bogota in '94.
I stand corrected. - Yeah, no joke.
I thought the wings were gonna blow off over Key Largo.
if you wanted a smoother ride you should have got us into a hangar with better planes.
I don't wanna sound high maintenance, but after squeezing into that plane
I'm gonna have to insist that we steal something with a little more leg room for the ride home.
we don't need to steal anything.
what, did you order up some limo service you didn't tell us about?
I made arrangements.
fuzzy dice.
what is this, like some kind of magic genie thing?
do I get some wishes too?
excuse me, gentlemen, I should take this.
Hello?
okay, I'll admit she didn't stab us in the back in Cuba, but she's trouble.
you swim with a shark long enough, eventually it's gonna take a chunk out of you.
Jesse, I hear you, but I don't have much choice.
Hey, at least we're back in Miami. Home field advantage.
well, that was interesting.
I just found out who exposed my identity, got me captured in the first place.
who? - Hacker syndicate. Based in Miami.
somehow they found out who I was, sold me to the highest bidder.
what now? - We destroy them, of course.
after two straight losses, Versacorp was allowed to pick a member from Protege...
to even out the teams.
we're gonna take Amy. - Don't you think you're giving Amy a little too much power?
maybe what you're telling me is I should just give her the job right now.
for their next task, teams had to pick an artist and sell their artwork at a gallery.
against the objections of his team.
I really would like you guys to see Leah's work. - I already made a decision. It's Andre.
meanwhile, Omarosa's lunch plans interfered with Heidi's work plans.
we don't have time to sit down for two hours.
I think you're being really rude, Heidi.
I'm not being-- [ Beeps ] rude. I can't fricking stand you. You whine and complain. Bitch, bitch, bitch.
[ trump ] That night, Protege's choice to pick...
a provocative and sometimes X-rated artist...
proved to be a tough sell.
what it is is everybody wants a virgin outside of the bedroom:
everybody wants a whore inside the bedroom. Ah, yes!
that is what I see.
[ trump ] Nick's decision to stick with his gut instinct paid off, and Versacorp won by more than $ 1 2, 000.
back at the suite, Heidi was distracted by her mother's illness.
are the doctors optimistic?
[ Heidi ] My mom is doing well. She's still in the hospital now.
they're doing tests on Tuesday just to make sure. - All right, love you. Bye.
[ trump ] In the boardroom, the drama between Heidi and Omarosa escalated.
my concern was sitting down in a restaurant could take longer than 25 minutes.
if she explained it that eloquently to me yesterday, we probably wouldn't have a problem.
you didn't let me get a chance to.
but because she likes to drop the " F " bomb every five minutes-- - Oh, my God!
[ trump ] Omarosa's endless confrontations with her teammates finally caught up with her.
I don't like the fact that you two argued over whether or not to have lunch...
when you have a small amount of time, and you are the one that wanted the lunch.
Omarosa, I don't like excuses.
you're fired.
[ trump ] Seven candidates are left.
who will be fired this week?
so you wanna be the next big thing
na, na, na, na, na So you wanna be the next big thing
you wanna be a spotlight Ah, you wanna be
they'll put you on the front page Wanna see the bright lights
Ah, you wanna see
that millionaire money, money
na, na, na, na, na So you wanna be the next big thing
na, na, na, na, na So you wanna be the next big thing
na, na, na, na, na So you wanna be the next big thing
na, na, na, na, na So you wanna be the next big thing
you wanna have a jet plane Ah, you wanna have
your face on the big screen You wanna have
a big yacht Oh, you wanna have
your very own TV show
wanna have a penthouse Ah, you wanna have
your name on a building Wanna have a spotlight
Ah, you're gonna have
that millionaire money, money
na, na, na, na, na So you wanna be the next big thing
Omarosa plays a very defensive game.
[ Troy ] Kwame, me, Omarosa and Heidi had to go to the boardroom.
Kwame and I have been a team forever. We've never not been a team.
I was so anxious for him to come back.
did he ask you who the weakest link was? Yes.
[ katrina ] I would fire Omarosa. I don't agree...
with the way she conducts business and the way she carries herself.
[ door Opens ]
no. - Is anyone home?
[ screams ] Hi!
[ cheering ]
Yeah! Oh, my God!
[ all Chattering ]
Oh! Omarosa's gone! Yea!
[ Amy ] Congratulations, you guys, for making it back.
it's a relief off my shoulder. - Look how much stronger your team is now...
because there's not conflict You have to deal with.
the team was getting dragged down. I think she was hindering team performance.
I wanted an electric shock button, but I didn't have one.
I don't know if we're stronger without Omarosa. Omarosa was very detail-oriented.
she was one extra brain, one extra body.
but with that came some conflict and some friction.
who knows how it weighs out in the end?
[ siren Wailing ]
[ Heidi ] Today, I was able to visit my mom in the hospital.
Hey, you. It's so good to see you.
my sister met me outside. It was so good to see her.
is she okay? She's fine.
my mom had the operation, and it was successful.
she's doing great. The doctors are so optimistic they got everything out, it hasn't spread.
I just feel so much better seeing her.
however, it does put things into perspective. - Love you.
this game is not the only thing in life that counts.
first and foremost, my family comes above anything.
you have to prioritize what's important.
[ telephone Ringing ]
good morning. Hi, this is Robin from Mr. Trump's office.
he wants you to meet him at 9: 30 across from the plaza Hotel.
there's a stand there with rickshaws. Great. Thank you.
[ bill ] We're geared up. We're ready for anything.
bring it on, baby. I'm ready.
good morning. - [ All ] Good morning.
now, this is gonna be interesting today.
transportation in New York City is a basic disaster.
getting around in the city is tough. It doesn't get any tougher anywhere in the world.
each team is going to manage a fleet of pedicabs.
starting tomorrow, for one eight-hour shift,
you must design and implement a business plan...
to increase revenue for the pedicab company.
the shift ends promptly at 6.00 p. m. no later.
at the end of the day, we'll find out...
who makes the most money by managing the fleet.
it's very simple. The losing team...
will see me in the boardroom.
somebody's getting fired.
have fun. Good luck.
you can prearrange appointments, possibly.
make appointments. Give people free rides today.
[ Heidi ] We elected Troy the project manager last night.
because I was a project manager, then Kwame, and it's just going round and round.
we're just being fair about it. There's no ifs, ands, whys or buts. It's his turn.
we can have two teams, 'cause we have one rickshaw thing.
it would be like us being the celebrity rickshaw.
[ Kwame ] In order to actually win this game, You had to think...
Where's the other angle to get money we can't get from just running rickshaws around the city?
we started to brainstorm on how we would manage our drivers, develop an incentive program, figure out a central location for where we wanted our drivers to go.
[ Troy ] The other thing is, could we sell a prepaid punch card in advance?
would they buy 1 0 rides in advance? That would create a higher profit.
I came up with a creative idea that we're gonna sell prepaid punch cards.
we're gonna buy volume discounts from the owner of the rickshaw company.
then we can go out and sell 'em in advance.
do you know where we could sell those? All these fancy hotels, and Central park.
it's won, you guys. I guarantee you: it's won.
this is the company. The Manhattan Rickshaw Company.
what about getting costumes? [ Bill ] In this task, I am the project manager.
it was either gonna be myself or Amy.
Amy and I decided to flip a coin, and the coin came up with my side.
we could all dress up in different Disney characters, or whatever. It's a schtick.
Ben Affleck, Sharon Stone.
or even have a contest every hour on the hour to see who makes the most.
I think a girl-- to have a girl driving them around Manhattan
that's a catch. There's something to that.
[ Amy ] We could advertise on the back of the rickshaw.
[ bill ] And then Amy said, " Well, let's sell advertising to them. "
it was like a lightbulb went off. We instantly knew that this could be something that we were on to.
Oh, my God. Now we're thinking, guys.
let's call up everyone we've met who has the restaurants and things...
and see if they wanna buy advertisement on the rickshaw.
we could be like NASCARs. You ever see those guys?
they got patches all over their car, their bodies.
if we put this together, it'll be a bloodbath.
[ Troy ] I think that looks great.
it looks legit. - I'm feeling good now.
I like those. They're really slick.
for as many people as you can, call up and just say, " Hey, we're representing the Rickshaw Cab Company. "
if you don't wanna call 'em, then please come up with a list of people we can go see.
cold leads on this type of situation, calling and trying to sell somebody our products over the phone like that
most likely, they're gonna hang up.
[ Kwame ] I think Heidi--she's managing this situation with her mom...
as best as anybody could, if not better.
that's a difficult thing. I lost my mom to cancer when I was 1 5.
so I know that situation very well.
[ Heidi ] Hey, Mom, how you doing?
[ Kwame ] And it is distracting and it is something that is constantly on your mind.
can we sit down and talk to you? Sit, sit.
we have two beautiful women actually taking them around the city.
pedaling. These two beautiful women pedaling. - Exactly.
we wanted to see if you wanted to advertise on one of the rickshaws. - Sounds good to me. I'll do it.
I'm gonna have to go cash. I like it.
[ bill ] We went to two establishments tonight after-hours.
two of the three places that we visited this evening are gonna participate...
in our advertising campaign on the rickshaws.
we're gonna do it. For tomorrow, right?
[ telephone Line Ringing ] [ Woman ] Marquis jet.
[ Amy ] Hi. Is Ken there? - Hi, Amy. How are you?
just fine. How are you? I'm well.
I split off to make calls to people that we had previously made relationships with, like Marquis jet.
I'll do it under one condition. You've both gotta wear...
Marquis hats and Marquis shirts all day. Sounds like a deal.
Yes!
talk to you later. Okay.
guy from the rickshaw company asked me if they were gonna be selling any big-ticket items.
wonder what that's all about.
they're not riding rickshaws. In fact, they're not gonna even see the rickshaws.
how do you know they're not gonna see the rickshaws? 'Cause Heidi told me.
Really? Huh.
so what else do you know? If you guys ask me, I'll tell you.
you guys haven't stopped to actually ask me my opinion on things.
'if you guys would've asked for my opinion-- " I mean
I feel like we've asked-- You guys have not asked for my opinion.
and every time I've said anything, you guys have shut me up.
I'm being honest with you. It's convenient for you to use me...
when my looks take our
wait a minute. You don't use that yourself?
are you kidding me? It's not convenient for you either? Bill
we're a team, and we're either gonna win as a team or lose as a team.
I'm successful for a reason, and it's not solely because of my looks.
and I feel like every idea I came up with yesterday, You tossed.
I'm sick and tired of it, so I'm just like not gonna get involved anymore.
[ katrina ] Bill doesn't listen to any of my ideas.
he uses me whenever it's convenient for him.
whenever we go to a sales pitch, he turns to us and says, " Oh, these beautiful women will be driving. " But what about my ideas? I'm not a pinup doll.
riding a rickshaw because a woman would be riding a rickshaw that looked cute
and that's really offensive to me, to be honest with you. Right.
because I'm not successful because I dress cute.
I don't-- I believe in a democracy. I would never wanna run it like Troy.
I think you believe that, but your actions don't.
Yeah, well, apparently, in your opinion they don't.
I just don't agree with your leadership style.
[ bill ] The bottom line is this. Katrina doesn't like the way I lead.
my advice to her is step aside, then.
I think we're gonna have a very, very substantial portion of this building leased before we start construction.
[Trump ] Thinking outside of the box...
is something that is very much of a cliche.
but if you really wanna be successful, that's how you're gonna have to do it.
people love the beauty of the building, and they love the location of the building. And I think they like Trump.
[ Troy ] Old Donald Trump announced the task.
we gotta go ahead and manage a team of rickshaws for the day.
the team that generates the most money wins.
Kwame, come up with an incentive program for the rickshaw drivers.
the driver who earns the most money is gonna get an extra hundred dollars at the end of the day, FLat out.
the driver who earns the most before noon, You're gonna get an extra hundred dollars.
pretty simple. Are they good? Are they exciting? I'm excited about it.
all I can say now is really get out and make as much money as you can.
we're out of here. Kwame. Best of luck. All right. Go get it done.
[ Troy ] Heidi and myself are gonna go out and do the sales aspect of the rickshaw.
and Kwame will be the one doing the pedaling of the bike.
[ Kwame ] Any rides today? Any rides?
okay, this is gonna go on-- All these are going on one car.
these two on the side. Okay.
[ bill ] In order to win the task, we have to yield the biggest profit.
so we'd like to sell advertising in as much space as we can.
it's a great tool to generate income.
so we're converting the rickshaws into NASCARs.
all right, Warnock. Well on our way, baby.
I'm putting myself in for a horrible loss and the possibility of getting terminated.
so I weighed the risk and the reward, and at this stage of the game I need to hit a home run.
do you need a ride? I'm in. Go ahead.
hop in.
there we go. - Thank you very much.
pedicab ride. Would you guys like a pedicab ride today?
pedicab ride, ma'am?
sir?
rides today? Ride today?
[ Kwame ] I suck as a rickshaw driver. I don't know why.
I was ringing my bell.
I was asking people if they wanted rides. I don't know.
I wasn't successful as a rickshaw driver.
anybody need a ride?
Hey, guys. What's up, Bill?
sorry, bro. No problem.
this one is hanging tough. We have to go get another Acqua pazza picture.
we gotta get two, because this one fell off.
[ Nick ] If we don't have a good couple hours with this guy's signs up,
I think we should go back and give him a few hundred dollars back.
he has gotten a value out of this. Right.
you gotta put a price on that.
[ man ] Front desk. Umberto, please.
one of the side signs got destroyed on the pedicab.
are you gonna give me a credit or what?
we did have it out there for a good part of the morning.
fine. But you come here, we'll talk about it.
all right, fair enough. You wanna go meet this guy and handle this?
um, I could.
[ Nick ] I'm very big on business ethics. You have to be able...
to look them in the eye and be happy with the transaction.
cause without your reputation, you're pretty much finished.
think about the big picture, man. We need every penny we can get.
Hey, sir, would you like a ride on a rickshaw?
[ Amy ] We thought that we had these wealthy execs, investment bankers, hotshots in New York City.
surely we could get 50-dollar fares.
can he go with me? Uh-huh. Absolutely.
you wanna go two blocks to the court? Ten dollars a person.
ten dollars a person? We can walk the two blocks.
come on! [ Amy ] But, no.
these guys wouldn't ride a rickshaw with two lovely ladies.
so we were kind of shocked.
how about 25 bucks, both of ya?
come on. It's supporting a great cause.
the Marquis Jet? That's a great cause?
come on! You wanna ride on the rickshaw?
huh? Oh, yes, I can.
[ katrina ] Amy really will do anything to sell. She's too pushy.
she thinks that every man's in love with her...
and every woman wants to be her best friend, and she's wrong.
cute guys.
[ Troy ] We go to the " W " Hotel, and they say, " Hey, come back and talk to us. "
we go to our next meeting, which is Tavern on the Green.
we kind of get the same, " Well, come back next week and talk to us. "
[ Heidi ] We're getting killed right now. It's then and there that I realized, " Wait a second. We've sold about $ 1 00 worth of stuff. "
but we spent advertising dollars, and I added it up.
we'd only made $1 1 . 25.
okay, here's what I say. We need to take 20 minutes and map it out.
because right now, we're just walking aimlessly.
I agree.
I told 'em if you're lost in the woods, the first thing you never do is try to walk yourself out.
our rickshaw drivers are doing fine. I am not doing good being apart from you.
but I know the card works. She sells better face-to-face, but we don't have an opportunity to be face-to-face with anybody.
you were out riding the rickshaw not making anything.
so together, let's work on the number one thing, and that's having fun.
let me go change my clothes, and I'll
you wanna change? Sure.
I'm gonna hoop it up on that rickshaw.
and we either hoop it all the way to the bank or all the way to the boardroom.
[ Kwame ] Troy was wearing a suit earlier in the day. When he decided we were all gonna have fun, he basically said, you know, " I'm gonna put on my cowboy hat. "
and like Superman, he got in the booth and changed.
he was no longer Clark Kent.
he became Troy, the cosmic cowboy.
Yee-haw! Let's go!
how you doing? Yee-haw! You're gonna make a left.
we're making a left. Watch out! [ Truck Horn Honks ]
rickshaw, baby! Rickshaw cowboy!
here's a crowd of people. Get 'em, Troy. Get 'em.
[ bell Dinging ]
I'm the rickshaw cowboy! How you guys doing today?
rickshaw rides. I'll pull over and talk to people.
make a time for a Central park tour.
I'm pedaling, people are laughing. People are having fun. And, man, it just starts clicking.
we start selling these things, 'cause we're having fun and we believe in it.
got the Greenwich Village, Wall Street-- Okay, great.
Thanks. Thank you very much. You guys have a nice day.
sixty. You should see how I was doing it.
there you go. Getting it done.
so you're here to discuss a credit with me?
I just wanna give you back the $250. I appreciate that. That's very nice of you.
thank you very, very much.
you're welcome. Here you go.
thank you very much. We really appreciate it. You're very welcome.
thank you for giving me the opportunity. No problem.
all right. Thanks again. Take care. Bye-bye.
[ cell Phone Ringing ]
this is Nick. - Hey, Nick, how's it going, man?
it would've been so easy to just say, " Hey, come on, Umberto."
it was up there for a few hours and whatnot. "
but I wouldn't have felt good about it. And if I don't feel good about it, I'm not gonna do it.
that sucks, man. Damn!
Bye-bye.
Nick refunded him the whole amount of money. What?
for the one sign. I told him to offer him $1 00.
so Nick gave him the whole 250 back. He says, " I didn't feel right. "
but the guy got a half a day worth of advertising. I know.
so we lost 250.
we're spending more money doing refunds. There's no reason that we need to go show 'em that stuff.
[ bill ] We're playing for high stakes now. The other team, they're a creative bunch. They're hard-working.
you never know what could happen.
they could pick up a $3, 000 fare somehow, someway.
this is New York City. Nothing's out of the question.
[ Heidi ] Are you interested in a pedicab ride?
you want a ride? You and your loved one?
your lover?
you guys interested in Manhattan Show Company? No? You don't want a ride?
damn it! I can't win today. That's all right.
how did I go from corporate America to this? I just wanna know.
people need to have more sex, because everyone is just so miserable.
you guys-- You guys, is that Team Versacorp?
is that a " V " ? no.
where? On the flag.
no. Yes, it is.
[ Troy ] There you go.
[ Heidi ] What's that, you guys?
[ Troy ] We see the other team's rickshaw go by.
and I said, " By God, they might've sold advertising on the back of their rickshaws. "
that's a great idea. I didn't think of it.
are you okay? Yep.
how'd this tie work today? Good? No.
no? No, it usually works better.
is that all the money? Yeah.
[ bill ] At the end of today, we all got together and the drivers handed us their money.
these guys didn't make a ton.
what you got? Not a lot.
the results were very negligible. It was a very poor response.
I mean, I was disappointed.
I don't know, Bill. This one I think we won.
I don't know, man.
I hope we pulled it off, dude.
if we lose this task, Bill will definitely take me to the boardroom, and I'll be the first person to say that he was a horrible p. M.
how you doin'? How you doing?
people were everywhere.
I've been working hard. Good.
you guys did awesome. You got the largest single fare.
Really? From where?
the most money before noon was Elena.
Yea! Elena takes it home.
thank you very much. Unfortunately, we have a big boss meeting.
okay, let's go. We're leaving.
so, how'd we do?
I think we did pretty well. - You think you won?
we're cautiously optimistic.
so?
I think we had a fantastic day. We had a fun day.
we'll just let the-- But do you think you won?
I'm feeling cautiously optimistic.
could it be a fun day if you didn't win? Absolutely.
the day can't be taken away. - I've never liked losing personally.
George, how did they do? - Well, I got the results here from Versacorp.
from the cab fares, they didn't do well at all.
they got $65 1. 29 in the cabs.
but then, they went outside the box.
they decided they were gonna sell advertising.
and in the advertising, they got another $3, 450.
most of the ads, I see, were companies that you'd dealt with before...
or people that you'd dealt with before, so you already had a connection.
so as far as the total profit was concerned, their total profit was $3, 680 for the day.
not bad. - A little less than we anticipated, but we came in all right.
a lot of ads. Carolyn.
well, I followed protege around, and they focused heavily on transportation.
unfortunately, that's all they focused on was just transportation.
so they actually had a profit of $382. 68.
Wow. You didn't do very well.
did you think of advertising? - We didn't think of advertising.
so that's a pretty good thumping?
they gave us a good thumping without a doubt. All right.
for the winners, you did a great job.
after fighting traffic in the streets, You're going to take a ride around Manhattan...
on a gorgeous yacht called Calypso.
all of you are gonna do it. You're gonna have fun.
for the losers, this was just a romp.
at this stage of your job interview, I am not impressed.
I'll see you back at the boardroom. I may just fire all of you.
[ man ] How you doing? Hi.
I'm the captain. Welcome aboard Calypso.
do I get to take the wheel for a spin on this bad boy?
Cheers. Cheers. Cheers.
[ bill ] We had a little victory celebration. Had some drinks, had some toasts.
just kind of enjoyed the moment.
now we're talking, baby. I like it.
[ bill ] That's really what you have to do in this type of situation, because you don't really have a lot of time to savor the wins.
tomorrow's a new day, and we gotta move on to a new challenge.
so you cherish every minute that you have.
can you hand me one of those with the pecans on top?
this? Can I feed it to you?
[ laughing ] Thanks.
[ katrina ] Amy and Nick have some kind of love affair going on.
but I haven't quite determined whether she's playing Nick...
or Nick's playing her.
they're playing each other in some sort of strange way.
I think Amy thinks she's playing Nick, but I think in the end Nick'll win.
no, I just think that you're hard to read.
Yeah, that's a pretty good assessment.
and you're always staring off into space, and I'm wondering what you're thinking. You wonder what I'm thinking about.
and I'm intimidated.
intimidated? I think so.
I am a little.
are you being sarcastic? Yeah.
[ Nick ] Amy's a very strong player, and it's good to be semi-aligned with her, 'cause she's very, very sharp.
that can only help both of us.
this is getting very competitive at this point.
I don't think so. I think I'm still in partnership mode.
[ Amy ] Not only have I had 1 0 consecutive wins.
my goal at this point in time is now to make it to the end without ever losing. So we'll see.
cute.
[ Troy ] If we have to go into it and it just comes down to him and I, the only promise I make to Kwame is the warrior's code, and that is that my sword's gonna be sharp.
I'm gonna swing it hard and fast, and I'm gonna cut you clean.
and may the best man win.
[ Kwame ] Troy could get fired 'cause he's the project manager.
I could get fired 'cause Donald Trump is probably tired of my-- [ Beeps ] at this point.
Heidi could get fired just because she's still kind of on the periphery.
and even though Donald likes her, there wasn't really something substantive that he could point to and say, " Heidi, here's a reason to keep you around right now. "
at least she doesn't need to go into radiation.
it's not in the organs, which is good. But, you know, a little bit is still in her lymph nodes, and they wanna zap it out.
I really, really don't want you to go, so please don't go in there and resign.
cause I'll be pissed off at you. I swear to God, I won't. I'll be totally myself.
at the same time, Katrina, you have to prioritize what's important.
family is the most important thing to me in the world.
sorry, but my mom's health is a little bit more important than winning the pedicab task.
did Troy tell you what he's gonna say in there? - Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
cause we're going there as a team tonight.
we're not going there like Omarosa and backstabbing and
you'll be fine.
Oh, my God. I gotta get ready.
so you guys had a good time though?
Yeah, it was a lot of fun. It was very windy.
I mean, it was like splashing water.
Troy, what time are we leaving? - I've got something to announce to you, Heidi.
I've made my selection. I'm taking you and Kwame to the board
[ Troy ] There's no pickingor selecting who goes into the boardroom.
there's three people on my team, and three people go into the boardroom.
so that accountability is on my shoulders.
ladies and gentlemen-- Ladies and gentlemen
we're going in as a team. Let's do the deed.
Hi. Hi. How are you?
good evening. Good evening.
so you were badly beaten.
you wanna be president of one of my companies?
at this stage, I didn't see any creative ideas from any of you.
so what happened? Troy, you're the leader.
we'd all come up with an idea that we thought was fantastic, and that idea was the prepaid rickshaw card services.
because we can only sell for one day within an eight-hour period, we thought, get the money today, but they can use 'em in the future.
the idea was fantastic. Heidi did a fantastic job on selling the cards that we had.
Kwame did a fantastic job on handling the finances and selling.
so how come the other team was so much better than you?
they had a brilliant idea that they came up with.
that you didn't come up with? That we did not come up with. Absolutely.
our idea was great. Theirs was brilliant. And sometimes, that's just the way it goes.
Heidi, how come you keep shaking your head? - I'm not shaking my head.
I'm not. It looks to me like you're disagreeing with what he's saying.
I'm not disagreeing. I'm really not. I do agree.
would you say that it's fair to say that...
you kind of put all of your eggs in one basket, came up with this idea, made a couple of appointments the day before, and did nothing after that?
would you say that was a fair assessment? - No, I wouldn't say that was a fair assessment.
okay, you came up with the idea of the prepaid. - Yeah.
what else did you come up with? - I can answer that question.
well, I directed it at Heidi.
you know what? He came up with that idea.
he was adamant on doing it, so I supported it. And to be honest with you, I thought that would be a good idea.
you think so now? - No.
you're saying this was basically Troy's idea?
he's the one who-- Again, just answer. This was basically Troy's idea--yes or no?
Yes, it was. Okay, that's it.
I got that part of it. - [ Troy ] Can I say one thing though?
sure. Even in comparing to the other team, because we're talking about the other team being so successful, which we all concur they are, wouldn't you say they put their eggs all in one basket also?
Yeah, but it worked.
did any of you drive the rickshaw? - I drove the rickshaw.
and how did you do when you drove it?
I stunk driving the rickshaw. Why?
uh, no particular reason. I went to all the areas suggested...
by the team of drivers who were experienced.
I went to Times Square. I went by Rockefeller Center. I went by St. patrick's Cathedral.
I rang my bell-- How many customers did you get?
I got zero customers. - So it was a big waste of time?
Kwame, do you think Troy did a badjob as the leader?
no, I don't at all. Do you think Heidi did something wrong?
no, I don't think they did anything wrong. - Who would you throw out?
just because Troy has been with me kind of throughout this experience...
and he's kind of exuded a lot of positive energy,
I would choose Heidi, but I think she's done a phenomenal job
you would choose Heidi to go out? - Yep.
who would you choose, Heidi? If I had to choose,
I would have to choose Troy, 'cause he was the p. M. and you have to take accountability.
do you have any other questions, Carolyn? - No.
do you have any other questions? - Doesn't anybody wanna ask me that question?
well, you're gonna be asked. 'Cause ultimately, you're gonna make the choice as to who goes out now.
you know that? No, I didn't know that.
well, that's what's gonna happen. All right.
normally, you keep two. Well, now you're down to three because you've been decimated.
so you're gonna choose one person to come back into the boardroom, one person to go back up to the suite.
who did the worst job of these two?
Kwame and I have made a decision with each other that it doesn't matter.
if he's the weakest link, by God I'm picking him.
and I've gotta be able to say that Kwame, he has supported us financially, he's taken care of all the finances
he also drove around today in a rickshaw all day long with nobody in it.
nobody in it. So that's a big waste of time, right?
we, as a team-- All right, listen.
enough of this. Who are you choosing to go up to the suite?
who are you choosing to stay with you? Somebody's getting fired.
I would have to say that Kwame goes upstairs. - All right.
Kwame, go upstairs. You two, go outside.
you'll be back in a minute.
see you guys. Best of luck to both of you. [ Heidi ] You too.
here we go, girl.
you're an-- [ Beeps ]
Ouch!
I did great on this task, and I did better than him on this task.
[ trump ] Who do you think should stay?
my feeling is that...
I don't think Heidi did a tremendous amount.
but I also think in this instance, the team leader came up with...
what I can't conceive of being a very creative idea, and I think a leader has to come up with something creative.
I think it might not have been a great idea, but at least he came up with something.
I have yet to see Heidi really come up with something.
I think she's riding on the coattails of everybody else.
is that woman on woman? That's tough stuff, right?
Yeah, maybe it is tough stuff, but I've seen nothing out of her.
at least Troy has the guts enough to come and say, " This was my idea. This is what I planned, and it failed. I'm accountable for it. "
so you think Heidi should go? I think Heidi should go. She hasn't shown me anything.
let's see. Robin, let 'em come in, please.
okay. You can go in to see Mr. Trump now. [ Troy ] We can go back in.
okay. All right. All right.
so what do you think, Troy? Why should you stay?
leaders are born. They're not made.
but if you are a born leader and it's in your genes, then you can build off of that.
you think you're a born leader? - Absolutely.
you think a born leader says that he or she is a born leader? - Absolutely.
there's no rule that says I can't. - So why should you stay?
I should stay because even though some of the tasks have failed,
I've been selected by my peers three times.
true. - I take risks. I don't ever take the cautious side.
[ trump ] Do you think Heidi is good or average?
I think Heidi's good. I think she's a good salesperson.
Absolutely. You think she's a good leader?
I think Heidi's a good salesperson.
I'd like to know-- - Wait, George. One second.
Carolyn had some very harsh feelings on Heidi and Heidi's performance.
say it. Well, my comments were, Heidi, in the time that we've been here, I have yet to really see anything out of you.
that's pretty harsh, right? - Yeah, I think it's very harsh. You're entitled to your opinion. I don't agree.
[ Carolyn ] Every time you've been on the losing team, you sit there and you go, " Yeah, yeah, you're right. We failed on that end. "
and that's what I've seen from you. You're entitled to your opinion.
of course I am, but it's obviously our opinion that matters.
I don't agree. I think I've done a great job here. I've been feisty.
do you think you've done a better job than Troy?
Yeah, I do.
why should you stay as opposed to Troy?
because I am a leader. I am feisty. I am aggressive.
I do the sales job good. I wanna be here.
but wouldn't you say he's also all of those things?
Yeah. - So why would you stay over him?
because as she said, she has yet to see me. She thinks I haven't done anything.
I'd like to prove myself-- that I can be a leader. I am a leader.
did you ask to be, or did you vote yourself or ask to be project manager for this particular task?
no, because we went in turns. - But he's three, you're one.
you're giving him a little bit too much power there then, huh?
unless you're setting him up to be the project manager.
no, I'm not setting him up at all. Um, he volunteered.
but everybody has said that he's a good leader, including you. Well, he is a good leader.
and nobody's said that about you.
there's no doubt in my mind anyway...
that you've all worked very hard and you're very enthusiastic.
what I've yet to see from either of you...
is that certain spark that sets you apart from somebody else and says, " Yeah, you can survive in an executive situation. "
for example, when we asked you the question who would you get rid of, you hedged.
if you feel somebody should go, they go, and you don't have to explain why.
explaining only makes you weaker as a leader.
George, I would say that I thought that you guys wanted an explanation.
and I went ahead and gave an explanation.
it was a long, boring explanation, and I didn't wanna hear it.
do you have anything else to say? No, I don't.
anything else to say? No, I don't have anything to say.
you've both come a long way. Somebody has to go.
somebody has to go right now.
you've done pretty well, and yet you've always been a loser.
as far as I'm concerned, You've lost all the time.
you haven't lost as much, but in this event...
you wouldn't step up as a leader, and you barely contributed as a follower.
Heidi, you're fired.
go ahead. Thank you, Mr. Trump. Thank you, guys.
[ Heidi ] I'm so glad for you. [ Troy ] Goodjob.
you done good.
I don't wanna be a manager. Give my love to Kat. I will.
[ trump ] I think Heidi is a remarkable woman.
she's got a lot going on. I just don't think...
she has the leadership skills to run one of my companies.
I like her, but really, it was time for her to go.
that was good, right? - Yeah.
[ george ] I loved it. All right.
this has been a great experience. I've had the best time.
met a lot of great people. Learned I could do things I didn't think I could do.
selling lemonade on the corner streets of New York City.
would I do it again? Absolutely.
you know, there's a lot of things to be learned from this game.
what I've learned from this game is I love being in sales.
I wanna stick to sales.
I'm ready to start selling again. It's been a great experience.
I'm glad I came this far. It's an honor.
you can't nick the Crown Jewels. -Why not?
why not? I'll tell you why not.
because it's unpatriotic for a start.
besides which, I don't fancy being banged up in the Tower of London for the next 300 years.
for once, I think Danny may have a point. -Yeah, thank you, Stacie.
what do you mean " for once " ?
if we get caught, they'll throw away the key, won't they?
exactly. I'm too pretty to go to prison. I'll never get any sleep.
call me old-fashioned, but I was hoping to avoid getting caught.
we're talking about the crime of the century.
there's a band of private collectors who are willing to pay a small fortune to add the First Star of Africa to their collection.
can we find them? -All in hand.
the First Star of Africa.
530. 2 carats. Also known as the Cullinan I...
because it's the largest of the nine stones cut from the Cullinan diamond discovered in South Africa in 1905.
it's now set in the head of the Royal scepter.
it is priceless.
home is the Tower of London.
there has only ever been one attempt to steal the Crown Jewels.
and that was by Colonel Blood in 1671.
what happened to him? -He failed.
great, so what are we gonna do? Swim the moat or scale the battlements?
no need. The Royal Scepter is being moved...
giving us a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
why is it being moved?
right now it's being cleaned by the Royal Jewelers...
and after that it'll be moved again. -Where?
the Guildhall Art Gallery is holding a major African exhibition...
to coincide with the Commonwealth summit.
it starts the day after tomorrow...
and the Star of Africa is to be the centerpiece.
all right. Think of it.
the biggest score of this century or the last.
something that will be remembered 100, even 200 years from now.
everything I know, everything I've learned has been waiting for this moment.
nothing this big will ever come our way again.
the downside is, if we get caught...
we all go to prison for a very long time.
you all right, Mick? You on your own? -Yeah, looks that way.
Cheers.
if I didn't know better, I'd say you were sulking.
Really?
what did you expect?
you asked them to put the rest of their lives on the line.
Yes, I did.
you rolled the dice, they came up snake eyes. It happens.
Yep.
just tell me one thing.
Why?
because no one has ever dared attempt anything this big for 300 years.
and that's it? -For me, yes.
look, this is the biggest game in town.
if we're not here, we're not anywhere.
I can see that.
you see, Mickey...
I had my doubts earlier...
but you can count me in.
Thanks, Danny. That's worth a lot.
but this can't happen without Stacie and Ash.
glad to hear it.
was he sulking, Albert? -I'm afraid so, yeah.
diddums. -I was not sulking.
well, it worked, looks like you're getting your own way.
no, now, wait a minute, come on.
this thing is far too big for anyone to be here for any other reason than they want to be.
you can't bottle it now.
cor blimey, first he sulks, now he's trying to back out.
I'm not backing out, but...
if we do this, we do it with our eyes open.
Hey, if we can't do it...
who can?
Eddie. -On the tab.
so, is this a change of direction for you boys?
you're thieves now? -Just trying to earn a living, Benny.
tell me about it, there are no honest crooks anymore.
everyone tries to screw you.
me, I've been screwed more times than a coachload of hookers.
I see you still have a wonderful way with words, Benjamin.
don't talk to me about words, Mr. Stroller.
a handshake was enough.
now, everyone's 14, with spots and rings in their noses...
all using fancy words to screw you.
'five percent of this. Two pints of that. "
'ten pence in the pound and pay you next Wednesday. "
Yeah, it's a different world. -That it is.
me? I've had enough. Next year, I sell up.
let someone else get screwed.
so. The great Mickey Bricks and Albert Stroller.
call me a Chinaman but my guess is you don't have a bag full of car radios.
not quite. -So what is it?
the Crown Jewels?
please tell me you're not serious.
what we're looking for are a few select private collectors to put in sealed bids.
an auction? -Winner takes all.
how long have I got?
we've found the cleaning company who has the contract for the gallery.
they employ mostly Eastern European workers.
you mean cheap. -Precisely.
and you start tonight. Those are the details.
all right.
Hello? -It's me.
Benny, what have you got for me? -It wasn't easy.
I have to say that personally, I think you're insane.
but if you pull it off, I've got five bidders lined up.
all topnotch.
I knew you were the man for the job.
sealed bids will be delivered to your hotel.
okay, Benny, I'll be in touch.
well? -We are on.
thank you. That's blinding. No.
no. Believe me, thank you very much. -Danny, what are you doing?
premium phone line, 50 quid a minute. -What?
I set up one of these lines. Every time somebody phones this number...
I get 50 quid in me pocket.
but how are you going to get people to phone the number?
no, listen, this is where the genius comes in.
cause I don't have to, you see.
all I got to do, yeah, is I borrow a phone and I call the number.
Yeah, then they think I'm making a 10p call...
but I'm getting 50 big ones in me pocket.
Danny. -Yeah, Mickey.
you did stop me using the credit cards.
they were very bad copies. -But they did work.
we got thrown out of a restaurant.
granted, everyone, but I had a few teething troubles.
Danny, I would much rather you focused on the job in hand.
I'm focused, gang, I'm focused. This is just a little sideline.
make a little bit of money to buy some tobacco when you get us all arrested.
Eddie, can I borrow your phone, mate? Just got to phone me old mom.
Hello, Mom?
I'll be watching you.
I've just made a pot of tea. -Yes, thank you.
I will just finish my work.
you'll wear the varnish off, you polish it any more.
but I want to do a good job.
Yes, and you'll do a better job with a cup of tea inside you.
I will be five minute.
what is happening in there? -Some kind of special exhibition.
all very hush-hush.
practicing a few moves. -And the music?
get me in the mood.
it worked for Tom Cruise, didn't it? -Okay.
I haven't got in the chamber yet, but from what I've seen...
they've got motion detectors, lasers, CCTV...
pressure pads and a steel door with a time lock.
belt and braces security then. -So what's the bottom line?
it would have been easier if they'd kept it in the Tower of London.
it'll be okay, we've got Spiderman on board.
Yeah. Let's all have a good laugh.
listen, I'll be the only one who's match fit, okay.
Yeah, there's nothing we can do about the pressure pads.
we'll have to work round them.
the biggest problem, though, will be the doors.
once they're shut, there's no other way of opening them until the morning.
can we get in any other way? -No. It's a sealed room.
no windows. That's why they chose it. -Can we tunnel in?
no, that would set off the motion detectors.
and there's no way of bypassing them? -Yeah. If there is, I haven't found it.
so what are you saying, Ash? We should just call the whole thing off?
no. Just give me a bit more time. I'll see what I can do.
in the meantime...
I'm late for work.
Yeah.
I'm gonna have to call you back.
Hello, Benny.
this is an inventory of what was found in your warehouse.
and this is a list of items reported stolen...
in the Greater London area over the past seven days.
as you can see they're virtually identical. -I bought every item there in good faith.
in which case you'll have receipts, invoices.
names and addresses of suppliers.
we had a fire. -Oh, yes.
of course you did.
crime report.
a container-Ioad of computer equipment...
was stolen from the docks three weeks ago.
they found the container yesterday morning.
someone had tried to burn it.
kids these days. No discipline.
the fire went out.
we dusted for prints...
and you'll never guess what we found.
perfect match.
bang to rights, Benny.
how long, Mr. Wells? -With your form, fifteen years.
you take a guilty, you might get 12.
well?
wait.
what about a deal? -What kind of deal?
the imminent robbery of the Crown Jewels.
you saw how magnificent-- -You said it seven times.
no. -Mr. Morgan.
I'm sorry to bother you, only the manager wondered...
whether you could bring your account up-to-date?
it is rather a lot. -Yeah, it is.
I didn't have that. -You did.
did you have that? -I didn't, I don't like
who had that? -Enough. It's not a problem.
Hey.
put your hand in there, mate. Keep it in there, I'll get this.
thank you. -All right, you're very welcome.
listen, love, while you put that through the old switcherooney...
can I use your phone? -Of course.
got to phone me old mom.
Hello, Mom?
you shouldn't be in here.
but I have to do floors.
not in here, sweetheart. They're bringing other people in.
I am sorry.
I can see I'll have to keep an eye on you. Come on.
come and have a cuppa. You can try my Bourbons.
Mick. -Hey.
how's it going? -I've got blisters on me blisters.
no gain without pain. -Yeah, right. Thank you.
look, I think I've got it. There's a safety feature on the door.
the time lock's got a panel on the inside, in case anyone gets locked in.
so can we use that?
if we can get someone inside before they close it.
Hey, haven't you lot got any homes to go to?
just a few more minutes, Eddie. -Yeah, come on.
I need my beauty sleep. -Yeah, I'll second that.
do you want a drink? -Won't you be lucky?
Eddie, I just want to say...
that I really appreciate you hanging on while Ash and I work something through.
Yeah, I know, Mick, but it's really late-- -Look, I'll tell you what, okay.
we'll just have one more drink...
and I promise, we'll be out of your hair really soon.
what do you say?
come on, we'll be gone by 1: 00.
no, but it's gone on...
I could have sworn it was later than that.
go on, then, one more. -You're a star.
right, come on, tell me about this safety feature.
sir?
ds Hodges? -Yes, sir.
your DI tells me you were working on a case last year. Michael Stone?
look, we had Stone under surveillance.
but he found out somehow.
and drafted in another grifter to impersonate a police officer.
and the case collapsed?
stone's man ran the investigation, sir.
must have been very embarrassing for you.
it was embarrassing for the whole department, sir.
DCI Mullens lost his job because of it. -Did he, now?
so...
tell me about Stone.
long con artist-- -No. I know what he does.
tell me about the man.
Mickey Stone is unique.
he doesn't think like we do. You can't second-guess him.
he gives the impression that he's making it all up as he goes along.
no.
but everything is planned, precise.
why me? -You drew the short straw.
I demand a recount.
so when you gonna push me
he puts together complicated...
and seemingly unrelated events, impossible to unravel.
waiter, I'll have one of those.
but all leading to the big con.
the higher the stakes, the more he likes it.
Yes, it has been long.
just when you think you've got him...
I've got a job for you.
are you sitting down?
...you haven't. -You sound like a bit of a fan.
hardly, sir, he made me look like an incompetent idiot.
then how would you like to get your own back?
Oh, God! Sorry.
I tell you now, I've definitely caught something.
okay, this thing isn't going to work unless we can get someone inside the gallery...
and in the exhibition room when the doors are locked.
once they're locked for the night, the doors can only be opened from the inside.
which is where you come in. -How?
we can get round the pressure pads by going over the top.
the main problem, though, aside from the time lock on the door...
will be the lasers and the motion detectors.
like I said, there's no way we can bypass them...
and they'll set the alarms off as soon as we set foot in the room.
solution? -The only way round it as far as I can see...
is to cut the power. -Won't that set the alarms off?
Yeah, but if we do it outside somewhere in the road...
we'll knock out the whole street.
there'll be alarms going off everywhere. -Smart.
during that time, we'll have 30 seconds to cover up the motion detectors...
and get to the door panel to stop the lasers from coming back on.
will that be enough time? -It'll have to be.
once the genny kicks in, the lasers and everything else will be back on.
CCTV?
I can re-route those at source during the blackout.
good. -So, what do I have to do then?
the motion detectors and the lasers have to be disabled from the inside before we open the door.
the exhibition has five main exhibitors.
the biggest of which is Joyce Martin.
so what is your area of expertise?
I absolutely adore the Urhobo pieces from the Niger Delta.
particularly the Iphri carved figures.
but, aside from the traditional...
I've always had a deep affection for some of the more contemporary pieces...
such as Bruce Onobrakpeya's epoxy resin etchings.
completely stunning.
who's been using my phone?
Mick, can I say something? -Yeah, of course.
I've got a really bad feeling about this. -How so?
I don't know, it just feels... -Foolhardy?
Yeah, that'll do for a start.
ash, this is the biggest thing we've ever done.
it was never gonna be easy. -Yeah, but there's so much can go wrong.
I know, but it won't. It won't.
okay, say it.
don't get me wrong, I'm not criticizing you.
I think you're a flaming genius.
but I have to say what I think. -And you think this is a bad idea.
it's what me gut says.
Hello, sweetheart. New face. How you doing?
thank you very much. Goodbye.
bids are in.
and Albie called, everything is set his end.
she's put me in charge of the items going on show at the exhibition.
so are we good to go?
Yeah. Tomorrow night.
the diamond, it'll be delivered to the gallery under armed guard tomorrow morning.
we know that Mickey Bricks and his team...
are going to steal it.
this is the first time that we've got a head start.
there is no way they can know we're onto them.
we must use that. -Okay, we know they're smart.
so no surveillance.
I won't risk them getting wind of this operation.
which means that we simply watch the gallery...
and wait for them to make their move.
does everyone understand that? -Yes, guv.
this team has made us look like fools too many times.
this time it's our turn.
I've found a place to cut off the power, but there's a problem.
what? -I can't be in two places at once.
at the same time the power is being cut off...
someone has to be re-routing the feed to the CCTV cameras.
can't you show someone how to do that?
no, it's best if I do it. Someone else can do the electricity.
okay, show Danny. -Me? No.
no, I have trouble wiring a plug.
it's all right. I'll talk you through it. We can use walkie-talkies.
okay, I'll do it. -Stacie, how you getting on at the gallery?
I've found a piece that's perfect.
Albert? -Everything will be ready.
okay, the exhibition opens tomorrow. So let's get some sleep.
we'll come in here. There'll be four guards in the control room.
one will be doing his rounds.
Yeah, there's no set time, so the chances are we'll have to get past him.
that done...
ash will give the signal to Danny to cut the power...
which will give us 30 seconds to re-route the CCTV...
and for Stacie to do her thing.
you must get to the door before the emergency power kicks in.
okay. -Or you'll be trapped by the lasers.
when you've done that, we should be on the other side.
I'd better go.
Albert? -Second floor.
and you must be on time.
we will. Any questions?
no. -Then let's go.
thanks for listening, sweetheart.
radio silence until further notice.
cleaning team.
on time.
you okay, Mick? -Yeah.
put that back in me bag.
all right.
maybe they're not going to do it tonight.
now what do I do?
okay. -All right.
come on, baby. There we go. -All right.
we're on, Mick.
now we'll tape it for a while and then feed the tape through on a loop.
okay.
Danny, come in. -Ready, over.
okay, that should be enough.
have you got the box in place?
hang on.
Yeah, I got the box in place.
when you put the clips on, nothing will happen.
then after 10 seconds, the power will cut out.
take the crocodile clips and clip them both on the
Vinny, where are you, mate?
I've got a pick up at 19 Chapel Road, West One.
Hello, you're on my frequency.
I think you'll find you're on mine actually, darling.
just get off the line, you dozy cow.
don't you use that tone with me or you won't get a cab.
I don't want a bleeding cab. Just get off the line.
who's that, Mary? -Some bloke messing about.
it's always the red. It's always red, isn't it?
come on. Or is it blue? Is it blue?
blue or red?
red.
what the...
good boy. Come on, Stace. You got 30 seconds.
12 elephant, 13 elephant.
16 elephant.
20 elephant.
25, 26 elephant.
30. Shit.
good. Okay.
cctv returned. It's all back up again.
all secured. -Okay.
Hello?
let's hope Stacie's done her stuff.
right, let's go? -Yeah.
thank you.
external power cut. It wasn't just the gallery, the whole sector was out.
security?
the emergency power is on and alarms have re-armed.
what do you want to do?
hold your positions.
I want to know if they're in there.
what's she doing? She should have opened the door by now.
something must have gone wrong.
come on, Stacie.
what kept you?
watch the pressure pads.
everything beyond this point is a pressure pad.
if we touch them, the alarms go off, all right?
you ready, Mick? -Let's go.
carry on.
down.
stop.
Hello, news desk, please.
lift.
okay, down.
stop.
okay, any time now would be good. -Yeah.
one for the scrapbook.
that's the cleaner's van again. -Shit, they must have been in the first van.
go. -Hit the alarms! Hit the alarms!
I knew it.
who the hell are you? -I'm with The Times.
we just received a call about a break-in.
get her out! -Yeah, okay, just one minute.
how many do you think were involved? -Please.
any ideas?
stay out.
there's no way they got out through any of the exits.
the roof.
Hey.
shit.
quiet.
do you mind?
dress.
they disappeared.
roadblocks? -They could be anywhere now.
okay.
it doesn't matter. -What?
think about it.
we know it was them.
but they have no way of knowing that.
which means? -They don't know we're looking for them.
I will bet you one year's salary...
they turn up back at the hotel. -They wouldn't be that stupid.
why not?
as far as they're concerned, they've got clean away.
I still think they'll be long gone. -We'll see.
guv?
Yes.
black cab just about to pass you, five people inside. I think it's them.
hold your positions.
wait for my signal.
that is what I call a great night.
I don't know about the rest of you, the old man's gonna hit the sack.
Yeah, I think I'll join you. -Really?
no. I don't mean I'm gonna join you. I'm gonna have me own bed.
I had no idea you cared. -I do care, I love you, Albert.
you said you loved me. Oh, my God! -Shut up.
listen, you lot do what you want, all right, 'cause I'm gonna get a drink.
cause I've had a very traumatic couple of days.
come on, then, I'll keep you company.
eye, eye.
stand still. Don't move.
what's going on? -You're all under arrest.
for what?
suspicion of theft.
I'm sorry, I have no idea what you're talking about.
take them away.
this way, please, sir.
...it may harm your defense if you do not mention when questioned...
something that you later rely on in court.
anything you do say may be given in evidence.
I'm a friend of the police commissioner. If you'd just call him.
bang to rights, Mickey, party's over.
wait in line.
I want to speak to my brief.
in good time, just stand there.
all right, who's first?
he's been arrested on suspicion of theft at the Guildhall Gallery at 10: 30 this evening.
name? -Ashley Morgan.
date of birth? -21/7/60.
address? -The Lexington Hotel.
empty your pockets out, will you, please?
you've forgotten something?
get this developed. -Sir.
take your tie off.
number three.
not quite as comfortable as the Lexington, but you'll have to make do.
all right, who's next?
police chiefs have just confirmed...
that five suspects have been detained for the theft...
of one of the world's best known diamonds, the First Star of Africa.
the priceless diamond, which usually adorns the Royal Scepter...
was recently moved from the Tower of London, to be placed...
as the centerpiece in a special public exhibition at the Guildhall Gallery.
resuming interview with Michael Stone.
9: 13 a. m.
so, Mickey, you've had a bit of time to think.
Yeah. -Is there anything you'd like to tell us?
nothing springs to mind. -Then I will ask you again.
can you tell me again where you were at 10: 30 last night?
it's slipped my mind. -It's less than 12 hours ago.
Yeah, I know, I've got a terrible memory.
I remember. No, it's gone again.
I'm terribly sorry, but my...
what's the word? Memory. It isn't quite what it was, you see.
what were you saying?
any chance of a fag?
a robbery? How thrilling. Have you caught anyone yet?
thank you, sweetheart.
look, I really have no idea what you're talking about, Officer.
interview suspended, 9:18 a. m.
Where's the diamond, Mickey? -Is that allowed?
Where's the bloody diamond?
what?
can I have a word, guv?
you might think you're clever, but I know you did this.
and I'm going to put you away.
with or without the diamond. -Sir?
I think you better see this.
it's the film we took from Morgan's camera.
testing. One, two, three, four. Can you hear me at the back?
ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Police Courage Awards.
would you please make your way towards your seats.
and the ceremonies will begin very shortly. Thank you.
and now the last of tonight's civilian awards goes to a late entry.
someone who was brought to the Commissioner's attention only a few days ago.
thank you.
waiter, I'll have one of those.
a man who, without any thought for his own safety...
saved the life of a fellow rambler.
michael Stone and the man who's life he saved, Daniel Blue.
I was leaning down.
there was an injured duck, you see.
so there I was just trying to help...
just help the little fellow, when suddenly, I lost me footing...
and the next thing I knew, I was in the water.
why me? -You drew the short straw.
I demand a recount.
so when you gonna push me
I was drowning. Definitely drowning.
I can't swim. Help. -Hey.
my whole life started flashing before me...
I'd just left school...
and I felt a strong hand pulling me up.
there he is, there he is.
it was Mr. Stone.
he...
saved my life. Thank you.
doesn't mean anything.
we've got nothing to place them at the scene and no diamond.
they've hidden it. -It gets worse.
we know the diamond was stolen half a mile from the ceremony at 10: 30.
the Commissioner's watch.
it says 10: 20.
you've forgotten something.
that's...
that's not possible.
and then just at the end, they add the little sprinkles on top.
and that's what makes it a mochaccino.
you're free to go. -I'm sorry?
I said you're free to go.
okay. It's just come back to me, where I was
get him out of here.
nice to see you again. It's been fun.
it's not over yet. You still have to move the diamond.
and when you do, I'll be there.
where have you been? -Hey.
the nice custody sergeant, he let me use his phone.
come on, we haven't got long.
CID.
are you sure?
okay, thank you.
sir.
we've found the diamond.
Yes.
where is it? -It's still at the gallery.
Doris, how did we do?
five copies as ordered.
that's great, Lily, just one more, please.
I don't understand.
why go to all this trouble...
and not even take the diamond?
the British government are naturally very embarrassed by this theft.
so Ml6 has come up with a plan to invent a story to save face.
they'll say the diamond has been found...
and the perpetrators caught.
they'll then put a replica into the Royal Scepter and replace it in the Tower.
Yeah, we're expecting the cover-up story to hit the press...
some time later today, just so you know.
so then, all that leaves me to do is to ask you, can I use your phone?
thank you.
Hello, Mom?
police?
I'd like to report the whereabouts of some stolen goods.
you got your amnesty? -In writing.
and Benny...
enjoy your retirement. -I certainly will.
Oh, ye of little faith.
you see, it's the perfect con.
there's no crime, so there's nothing to be arrested for.
and the only losers are five mugs greedy enough to buy five fake diamonds.
and when they find out they've been conned...
who are they gonna tell?
there it is, back of the net.
right, this is a toast. A toast to Mickey Bricks...
who is without doubt, a bleeding genius. -Worthy of any of the greats.
I still think he should have told us at the start.
the risk was the same. If you got caught...
who would have believed you weren't stealing the diamond, simply moving it?
will you take a look at that?
nice one, Lily. She deserved a bit of luck.
Yeah, it's beautiful, Ash, nearly as beautiful as the fact...
that I've now clocked up 93 minutes on my phone line...
which comes to 2, 500.
right on.
Hey. -Hey.
who paid the bill? -Danny.
with what? -Credit card.
please tell me you didn't. -What?
the police are downstairs...
and the receptionist is showing them a credit card receipt.
so, please, Danny, pretty please with knobs on...
tell me you did not use one of yours.
we better pack. -Danny.
we've just pulled off the biggest con of the century...
and we're sneaking out of a hotel for paying the bill with a bent credit card.
Yeah, blame me, why don't you? -We do.
I've had a very rough couple of days, you know.
all for the good of the team. I've been pushed in that bloody canal.
nearly drowned. I been electrocuted, nearly fried.
I've had a very harrowing time, I'll have you know.
are you lot listening to me? -No.
come on, Albie. -I'm coming, I'm coming.
one chick, fully feathered, two adults.
empty nest.
last one. One chick, fully feathered, two adults.
horrible system forecast from the East later.
Yeah, I saw that. Finlay!
Hey, kiddo. You arrive OK, then?
I did, thanks. And I forgot how cold it was over here.
so, aside from cold, how is it? 'Windy!'
why couldn't you've been born in, like, the Caribbean instead of Fair Isle?'
ahh... You know I'd miss the rain.
I'm sorry I can't be there.
how's that pile of paperwork anyway? I'm getting through it. CEILIDH MUSIC PLAYS 'Is that music I can hear?' Yeah. We're just about to go in.
well, tell your gran and grandad that I'm asking for them and have a good time with Angus.
and, you know, you behave yourselves.
we will. Love you. And I...
Hey. How's your dad? Fine, I think. Yeah.
you forgot to ask, didn't you? Sort of. But he sounded fine.
Ah, yes! Thank you, Frank. Thanks, Frank.
there you are, son. Come on.
happy birthday. Happy birthday.
Cheers! Cheers!
there's Angus! The happiest of birthdays to you.
happy birthday, Angus.
happy birthday, Angus.
Hey! I'm good, how are you?
how many times have you and your wife wished each other a happy anniversary today?
haven't you heard? Absence makes the heart grow fond of texting.
you're like a pair of Canada Geese.
honk, honk to you, my sad, unpaired friend.
ha! Unpaired I may be.
sad about it?
no.
Peter, could I have a word?
are you lot going to join in the festivities or are you going to stay in here like a bunch of antisocial lab rats?
bit busy right now, Frank.
working in here isn't a judgment against dancing through there.
Yes, but it doesn't hurt to let the islanders know that we're reasonably normal, and not just totally obsessed with their bird life.
Oh, I am totally obsessed with their bird life. So am I.
Anna, please. It just helps.
Oh, for God's sake. You wanted a word, Anna?
Oh, yeah. You two go ahead.
first drink on me?
first? How many do you have in mind?
well, as many as it takes until we lose count.
well? Close the door.
close the door...and lock.
just closed will be fine.
drink, please. I'll get it.
you're all right, Finlay, I'll take it from here.
little tip. Better to chat her up away from the husband.
what are you doing here?
right, this is my wife Tessa, Frank Blake.
hang on, say that again.
radio: 'overnight to storm force ten that will be accompanied 'by heavy driving rain.
due to the conditions, the airport is expected to shut down within the hour.
this will make travel between the Mainland 'and Fair Isle impossible for the next 24 hours...'
there!
are you all right, darling? Yeah.
bumpy flight, I take it?
aye... Just a bit.
good to see you, Jimmy. You too, Dad.
this is my colleague, Detective Sergeant Alison McIntosh.
Hello, sorry, I'm not always this shade of puce.
Jimmy's mother's the same. It's the boat for her every time.
right, now, let's get these things loaded up.
given how much time we've already lost, it's probably best if we just crack on.
did you manage to keep everybody away from the laboratory?
I got Donnie down there and he's put everything on lockdown.
and Isobel is with the family.
the weather is probably going to shut Lerwick down for 24 hours at least.
so we are on our own, Dad.
we're all devastated, Jimmy. I know.
there hasn't been an unlawful killing on Fair Isle for 70 years. And even that was caused by the Luftwaffe.
people are scared.
you're their lay preacher, Dad, just do your best to reassure them.
hopefully, you'll be able to wrap this up pretty sharpish.
one of the scientists at the Centre hasn't been seen since last night.
Peter Latimer. What does that mean?
I'm just saying that if I was a bookie,
I wouldn't take any bets on who did it.
it's probably just as well you're not a bookie then, Dad.
aye, well.
right, better get started here.
dad, can take you Tosh down to the harbour and see if there's any boats missing.
but can you take Cass home first? Sure.
and if a boat is missing? Main island coastguard?
Aye.
if he's headed north, that'll almost certainly mean a recovery operation.
that stretch between here and Shetland is notorious.
even locals like myself struggle to navigate it.
well, I'm sure they are aware of that, Dad.
can I help you with that?
I'm Finlay Caulfield.
I was Anna's assistant.
we've been waiting for you, actually.
we thought you wouldn't get here before they shut down the transits.
I'm Detective Inspector Perez.
could I see Doctor Blake's body now, if you don't mind?
the body is in the lab, just through here.
I'll be fine from here, thanks.
well, there's no vessels missing.
Really? OK.
so then, this Latimer is still on the island.
is that a good thing or bad? Who owns these huts?
well, that's the, err...
the fishermen there and this belongs to the Research Centre.
shouldn't we be getting straight back?
just need to check these, he could be hiding until dark.
aye, well, there is that.
Hey, wake up.
Hey, Donnie, good to see you.
and you, big man. And you.
just wish it was under slightly different circumstances, obviously.
Aye.
anything?
no, nothing here. And you?
same.
sir, there aren't any boats missing and there are no signs of anyone trying to hide nearby either.
OK, keep looking and...
listen, I want you to ask my dad if we can set up an incident room in the village hall.
also, I've made a start on the crime scene, but I just need to check something and then I'll start feeding information through to Sandy. OK?
he's gone out for a cigarette. I thought this might prove useful...
am I right in saying that visiting researchers would be given a front door key? That's correct.
and so, who would have a full set?
that would be the three permanent members of staff.
that's the Blakes and myself. They're hung up in the office.
and were they still there this morning? Yes.
are these bedrooms? Erm...yes.
that's mine. Erm... That's Bill's.
Latimer's.
that's Anna's. And that's Frank's.
so, Dr Blake and her husband, they slept apart?
Yeah.
OK.
I'm so sorry, Frank.
well, in the old days, if I'd have thought of hiding out,
I would head for the lighthouses up at Skroo or at Skadden.
good vantage points over the whole island.
why the old days? Well, they've both been automated for years, so they're completely locked up, your man couldn't get in.
could he break in? Unlikely.
you still want to check them out, eh? Please...
Aye. Good! Good!
listen, thanks for standing guard.
Oh, not at all, not at all. I am only happy to help.
bit weird though, ain't it? Aye.
listen, I just wanted to check something with you.
has anybody been in or out of that lab since the body was found?
no.
not since I was there, no. You're sure?
positive, aye. Right. OK.
Isobel and Angus are looking forward to seeing you.
did he like his present? He loved it, Jimmy.
I know I've not been the most hands-on of godfathers...
no, no, listen, we understand.
you and me, we'll get a chance to have a proper catch up later, eh.
aye, aye, sure. Aye. You get on now.
I'll see you later. Right.
there is severe bruising at the left temple...
but not on the right.
and there's another bruise on the right cheek.
but there's...
there's no other signs of physical injury.
OK. Got that.
there's signs of a violent struggle within the room,
but there are no blood spatter on the floor...
or the walls, and there's no blood emanating from anywhere on the body.
dr Blake's computer is still running, which suggests that she didn't have time to shut it down before the attack,
and it's password protected.
OK. OK.
some sort of altercation has taken place, during which Anna Blake has received a severe blow to the left temple...
and she's died.
but the question is...with what?
would you say Anna Blake was popular with the locals?
Anna was all about the work. And Frank looked after everything else.
but fair play to her.
she kept this island's profile right up there all over the world, and that put money in everybody's pocket.
who's that?
that's him. That's Peter Latimer.
right. Pull in here.
my name is Detective Sergeant McIntosh.
if you're thinking of running, Mr Latimer, number one
I was a cross-country champion and number two... Why would I think of running?
where have you been?
come on, Sandy, that's 20 minutes.
they're coming. They're coming. Have you got them yet?
I have got them. Finally. I will send them straight to Inverness.
I need anything that illuminates the choreography of her final moments.
I also want you to pull the phone records for Anna's lab phone.
cos I want to know who she was talking to in the last few weeks.
and you want her mobile too?
Yes, if I can find it. All right?
OK, good.
sir?
tosh. I've got Latimer.
where was he?
we found him walking back to the Centre.
apparently, he's researching changing migration patterns.
he told me he left the Centre early because he'd received news that eight Icterine Warblers had been reported flying south, and he didn't want to miss them if they flew over the island.
it's apparently why he stayed out so long...waiting.
did he have binoculars?
a camera? Notebook?
he claims he slipped on a path on the cliff top, lost his grip on his backpack, and watched it tumble into the sea.
well, then, he wouldn't have known that Anna was dead.
he gave no indication that he did.
did you say anything to him?
all he knows is that there was "an incident" at the Centre. Good.
I've asked him to wait alone in one of the reading rooms for the moment.
OK.
well, I'll speak to him after I've spoken to Anna's family.
your father made a couple of calls and says the village hall's ours for as long as we need it.
excellent. He's a connected man, your dad.
Yeah, well, I suppose when you live on an island with 70 people, being "connected" isn't a bigger deal as you'd think.
plus he is the lay preacher and that gives him a certain...status, which he does enjoy.
right. I'll talk to Frank, you search Latimer's room.
because if he did kill Anna, then, he almost certainly left the Centre early so he could dump whatever he killed her with into the Atlantic, but see if you can find anything else in there that links him to Anna.
mr and Mrs Warren?
Yes, that's right. If there's anything we can do...
well, at some point, my colleague Detective Sergeant McIntosh is going to have to take separate statements from you both regarding where you were last night.
is that really necessary? We were together the whole evening.
we'll be as quick as we can.
Thanks, Isobel.
they're both in shock.
it's good to have you home, Jimmy.
I am sorry for your loss.
I am going to have to ask you a few questions, Frank, it's probably best if we do it now.
Joe, would you mind waiting outside?
have the police given any indication when we can return to our rooms?
Tessa needs to lie down. This has been a terrible shock.
did she know Anna?
did she have to? To be horrified by what happened to her?
the police have told us to remain downstairs until told otherwise.
would your wife like a cup of tea?
it would only upset her stomach.
something to eat? I could make her a sandwich.
Thanks, I doubt she would keep it down.
I wasn't going to fill it full of puffin shit...
you supercilious arse.
when was the last time that you saw your wife?
when I turned in.
at what time was that? Can you remember?
about one. Was the dance finished by then?
had everybody gone home?
but by one o'clock, as far as you know, the only people who were left at the Centre were the people who were living and working here.
as far as I know.
and none of those people would have had any reason to attack your wife?
she was my wife.
I should have protected her.
can you name those people for me?
I'm sorry, Frank, I know this is insensitive, but I just have to ask...
can I get you a glass of water or something? -No.
no, no, I'm fine. OK.
you want me to name the people who were staying here, OK.
Yes, please. OK.
it was myself, Anna, our son, Joe...
bill Warren and his wife, who turned up to surprise him on their wedding anniversary.
OK?
thank you.
did you often go to bed before your wife?
you don't become pre-eminent in your field without putting in the hours.
so she worked hard?-Ferociously hard.
did you resent that?
in our field, we don't resent those who are cleverer or more insightful than us.
we applaud it, we're grateful for it.
cos in the end, it moves us all forward.
so it was because of her hours then that you slept apart?
don't waste your time by reading anything into that.
our marriage was fine.
so where was Anna when you said good night to her?
in the lab, working...with Peter Latimer. -Working?
with all due respect, shouldn't you be talking to somebody who wasn't in their bed when she was killed?
I mean, wouldn't that be more useful?
was there anything unusual in your wife working with Peter Latimer late? - - There was nothing unusual.
she oversaw all the research here.
and he's a postgraduate student.
right, so you locked up... Yes.
and you said good night to your wife...
Yes.
and you went to bed. -Yes.
now, go on and find out who killed her before I do.
excuse me...
Sandy... The pathologist's had a look at your photographs, she's got a possible cause of death for you.
extradural haemorrhage, it's caused when a blow to the temple damages blood vessels running to the top of the brain.
this results in bleeding within the skull.
and if left unchecked, it simply pushes the brain down through the base of the skull and into the top of the spinal column.
so it's the base of the brain that controls the breathing and when it's squashed, it just simply stops working.
any word on Anna's phone records yet?
hopefully on there way to me now.
all right.
while we're waiting, I have a couple of names that I want you to run through the PNC.-OK.
a Dr Frank Blake, 'Emeritus Professor of Biology at Birmingham University.'
birmingham Uni.
and Peter Latimer.
postgraduate student in Avian Biology at Oxford University.
Peter Latimer, Oxford.
I'll get Tosh to e-mail you the rest.
and then you get back to me as soon as you hear anything, OK?
will do.
excuse me. Are you with the police?
I'm Detective Inspector Perez. -Excellent.
then perhaps you can tell me what's going on and why I'm being cooped up in here?
OK... Well, let's not talk out here.
what's going on...is a murder investigation.
a murder? Yes.
on the island here?
dr Blake was found murdered in the lab, this morning.
Anna? I didn't say which Dr Blake.
sorry. I just assumed.
no, well, you're right, it was Anna, I'm afraid.
christ almighty!
wha...what happened?
her body was found in the lab this morning by Finlay Caufield.
and I have to say your absence from the building seemed to cause...
quite a stir.
I explained to your colleague... I... Yes.
Icterine Warblers.
Yes. If the sighting was correct, it's significant cause for concern.
well, it's not as significant as the woman you've been working alongside for the last few months being found dead in her lab, surely.
no. No. Of course not, I was just trying to explain its significance.
sorry, I...
I...think I'm in shock.
can I ask you something?
how did you find out about the arrival of these birds?
Warblers? Was it e-mail?
was it a text? Or what was it?
it was an RSS feed.
and did anyone else get this feed?
no, no... No, I don't think so.
bring it up for me.
I think I should speak to a solicitor.
there is a storm on the Mainland, you're not going to be able to get a solicitor here for at least 48 hours. Why don't you just talk to me?
I didn't kill Anna Blake. -I didn't say you did.
no, but you think I did. You don't know what I'm thinking.
one thing's for sure - you didn't leave this building this morning to spot eight birds prematurely flying south for the winter.
so...
don't insult my intelligence.
well... Latimer wants a solicitor.
you know, I've told him, with the weather coming in, he's unlikely to get one for at least 48 hours, but he's adamant.
do we take that as an admission of guilt?
his backpack and equipment aren't here. He maintains he didn't kill her.
although, you know "I didn't" can turn into "I didn't mean to."
but then, it's possible he's telling the truth about that and lying about why he...
there's someone.
Finlay? I thought I asked everybody to stay downstairs.
Oh, there was something I needed for work. So quite urgent then?
urgent enough to disobey a direct police instruction during a murder inquiry?
I just thought it wouldn't matter if I nipped up here briefly, and got what I needed and... It does matter.
what did you come up for?
well, I thought it was up here, but... Finlay, you're beginning to annoy me just a wee bit.
just answer the question. Well, it must be down in the lab.
what? The memory card, that one that you're holding in your left hand.
you can stand there looking glaikit all day if you want, I don't mind, or you can give me the card.
LOOK...IT'S not what it looks like.
if you're going to think on your feet, you'll have to be a wee bit quicker than that.
and don't you even think about swallowing that.
trust me, on the way out, it'll hurt you a lot more than it will me.
now, for the last time...
.Give me the card.
see... Why would you do that?
where were you last night? Look at me.
don't turn your bloody back on me. Get off me!
where were you last night? -What is wrong with you?
where were you? Do you think I'm bloody stupid?'
do you think I'm bloody stupid?! Do you?
do you?!
do you think I'm bloody stupid?! -Frank!
leave him!
you were in the lab with her last night!
that means nothing. Means nothing.
means nothing.
take a minute.
just think about your boy.
the last thing he needs is his old man in a jail cell right now.
I'm not stupid. You understand?
I'm not stupid.
so I take it everybody on the island knows about the killing?
what do you think?
people are scared, Jim. Fair Isle doesn't do crime, remember?
don't you miss that, Jimmy?
sure, who wouldn't miss that.
so what do you prefer about Lerwick then?
honestly? -Go on.
well, it's where I met Fran.
it's where Cassie was born.
it's where her dad lives.
and plus it's about the right size for me.
you know, if you want people to know your business, then, you can share it with them and if you don't, you don't have to.
you have no choice here.
Aye.
does he not know how busy you are?
Jimmy's here! -Jim?
what?
what about him?
any idea why he would come back during term time?
how do you mean? When did he come back?
last night.
right. I didn't know that...
it doesn't matter.
coffee? -Yeah.
here he is, my favourite godson! -I'm your only godson!
how are you? -Good.
good. Thanks.
thanks so much for the iPad, by the way.
that was the right...thing then?
bloody brilliant. -Bloody expensive.
you're only 18 once. -Exactly...
I remember when I was 18.
do you remember when you were 18, Jimmy?
right, Angus, I've got a problem.
actually, I've got two problems.
three if you include not being able to count.
this is problem number one.
that's easy. They don't usually work without the camera.
no, no, no. Seriously now.
can you get the photographs that were on that?
hi there, my wife Mary thought you might be hungry after losing your breakfast on the way over.
nothing heavy, just food for a tender tummy.
that's very kind of her. I'll leave it with...
how could someone do that to a beautiful and intelligent woman?
I just pray that it wasn't an islander.
does that really matter, Mr Perez?
for us, it does. This community survives on mutual trust.
this could completely destroy it.
who would have thought it, eh?
our old village hall - an incident room. Well, needs must, I'm afraid.
excuse me... Sorry.
Yes, Sandy... Tosh.
according to Anna Blake's phone records, two weeks back, she called the airline flying between Fair Isle and Tingwall.
he's on a diet.
so I requested details of any flights booked in her name and there were two same-day return tickets to Tingwall on the 23rd of last month, a week and a half ago.
and the name of the second passenger?
well, it's damaged.
Yeah.
but as long as the flash memory on the card is intact and the internal circuit board isn't cracked, it should be possible to retrieve the files.
come on, Angus, how long is this going to take?
you're back on Fair Isle now, Uncle Jimmy.
the land where time doesn't just stand still, it frequently loses its internet connection.
Ah, here we go.
uncle Jimmy? -What?
you haven't told me about problem number two!
aye, I'll speak to you later!
he retrieved the data? -He did indeed. There you go, stick it in.
do you think it's worth getting him to take a look at Anna's laptop? Unofficially.
if I can't crack it, I'm just going to leave it with him, and just let his natural, geek-like curiosity run its course...
Oh, Sandy called.
Anna Blake booked two same-day return flights to Lerwick a week and a half ago.
why two?
one for herself. The other for Peter Latimer.
and why would Anna and Peter Latimer go to the main island just for the day?
I can't imagine！
why would a beautiful woman, married to an older man, want to get away from the prying eyes of Fair Isle to spend an afternoon alone with an attractive student?
if that was the case, they could just have slipped behind the bike sheds.
why go all the way to the main island? -You think?
I mean...Frank maintains that the reason they slept separately was because she worked all hours.
Yeah, but he would say that, wouldn't he?
and I did get the impression that he did love her very much.
Yeah, but did she still love him? What is he, in his fifties?
no offence, but it would be like me fancying you. -Thanks very much
the fact that he loved her like he did means he could have been capable of killing her in a jealous rage.
he's got it in him - if we hadn't come in when we did,
Latimer could be dead. -Before you go too far down that road, just have a look at the contents of Finlay's camera.
if she was the last Icterine Warbler on Earth, this number of pictures would be excessive... Uh-huh.
he is totally obsessed.
the only one he doesn't have is Anna dead.
was she sexually assaulted?
well, we'll need the results from the post mortem, but it didn't look like it, no...
right, let's say it's Finlay.
he's been here for the best part of a year.
why last night, what was the trigger?
has a few drinks at the party for Dutch courage.
comes on to Anna in the lab.
get's rebuffed.
humiliated and angry...
the fact that he tried to destroy the memory card gives us enough to arrest and question him at least.
that's me heading out, Billy. -In this weather?
I've got a lead on Finlay Caulfield. I'm going to check it out.
I'll not be long.
where is she, where's Mum?
they took her away.
where?
they moved her somewhere safe, then they're going to take her to the Mainland.
I want to see her.
I don't think that's a good idea. -That's not your decision to make.
I think it is, I'm your father.
be good if you'd acted like it a bit sooner.
listen, I don't want to argue with you.
I'm just trying to protect you.
I don't want your last memory of your mother to be...
her corpse.
Yes.
you can't control the way I feel.
could you tell me where I might find Gina?
she's over there. -Thank you.
detective Constable Wilson. Might I have a word?
what about? -Finlay Caulfield.
maybe we could take a seat, if you have minute?
thank you.
I'm sorry for bringing up the past like this.
it's all right, what do you want to know?
you met Finlay at a singles club, here at the library?
that's right.
and you went out on a date?
just a drink, really.
I wasn't interested in seeing him after that, so I gently knocked it on the head.
the male ego does bruise easily.
but by that time, he had your e-mail address, is that right?
Yep, that was a mistake.
and he started pestering you?
he wanted to see me again.
I just kept saying no till the e-mails stopped.
then, after a month, I started getting e-mails from a different address.
each one wordless, but with a different attachment.
Gina, what was in the attachments?
photographs of me going about my life.
you know, normal stuff.
but it was creepy.
I was completely unaware he was watching me like that.
did he ever threaten you physically?
no. Never.
and now, no more e-mails?
no, thankfully.
why do you think they stopped?
so... What was her answer?
she said that after receiving a police caution for harassing her, she'd heard he left town for the job on Fair Isle at the Research Centre.
right. That's great work, Sandy.
have you heard anything yet about where Anna Blake and Peter Latimer checked into for their....secret tutorial?
not yet, but it'll take a while for everyone to check their records.
OK, well, just remember they might have used false names, so while you're waiting for something to happen, start trawling through the CCTV between the times of their flights in and out of Tingwall.
will do. -Anything that will help get a confession out of Latimer before his solicitor arrives is going to be great.
because, you know, there are 70 souls on a very small island,
sandy, and one of them is a murderer. People are getting scared.
OK? Bye then.
right, bring me Finlay Caulfield, will you?
Hi, Dad.
I missed you today. -I missed you too.
I am sorry about that.
it's OK. You can't help it. -I'll make it up to you.
you don't have to.
cas, did you know that Joe was coming back to the island last night?
why would I?
well... No, I just thought maybe he might of mentioned it on Facebook or Twitter or...
OK, we both know they are the only two social networking sites you've ever heard of.
I know Joe, but we're not really friends.
ask your father when they want their tea?
nan wants to know what time you want to...
what in God's name...?
what was that?
I don't know. We can go and have a look in the Land Rover.
we don't have a key. And I can't find anyone.
we're on Fair Isle... Keys'll be in the ignition.
it sounded like it came from Donnybrook.
I didn't grow up here, remember? Be less specific!
that way.
Tosh, be careful.
what's happened?
dad, stay where you are.
what is it? What's happened?
who is it?
it's Peter Latimer.
he's not breathing. -Oh, dear God!
next Time
are you any closer to finding out who actually killed her?
I mean, it's an island, how difficult can it be?
for the sake of this wee lump of rock, Jimmy, catch this person.
I never would have hurt Anna and I never hurt Gina.
scared Gina though.
what's going on? Why did you question Donnie?
talk to me about Joe Blake. Now.
I need to speak to you.
OK.
I know who killed my mother.
this is a dream come true for them.
Yeah, well, isn't that the point of winning the lotto?
making dreams come true.
courtesy of Pascal, our new pastry chef.
why did you lie to me?
what is that?
it's you and your cousin Razmik making out in the back of the restaurant.
I don't think that he's her cousin.
I'm pregnant.
it's your baby.
go be pregnant somewhere else!
you can't trust her.
everything she says is a lie.
it's a pregnancy test.
it's positive.
I killed my sister.
it was an accident.
get in the car.
we can have a great life together.
Hey, no. Please...
you love him!
Yes, I do.
I gave you a home.
I gave you a family.
this is still my home.
I want you to go.
Nina, be sure.
I swear, I'll take you at your word.
we're done.
I don't know who this woman is, this pizza delivery person, but that unaccounted-for dollar is mine.
what's the best way to your house?
I figured you were married, and I just...never thought that would happen.
no, seriously.
when I first started working at the plant, before the lottery, part-time, after school,
I would try to get the hours when I knew you'd be there.
don't freak out.
it was just a crush.
I knew you were taken.
Yeah, um, about that.
I know that things are really new for you right now, so I'm not pushing for anything.
but there's, um...
there's something I want to tell you.
I lied about the lottery ticket.
you did what?
I said Kimberly's ticket was mine when it wasn't.
look, you have to understand why.
sunny, I defended you.
I stood up for you.
because you knew I deserved it.
no, because you lied to me and I believed you.
look, if you'd just let me explain.
what kind of person does that, huh?
who steals money from their friends?
well, that's why I'm telling you now, okay?
I know that you feel betrayed by everyone close to you.
and I don't want to be one of those people.
it's a little late for that.
who's that?
Sean? Is that you?
I didn't mean to scare you.
what are you doing here?
I need a favor.
at 10: 30 at night?
Oh, my God, Sean. What happened?
I got shot.
don't worry. It wasn't anywhere near here, okay?
you're not in any danger.
all right, you need to get to a hospital.
I'm gonna call 911.
no, no. Listen.
the police are looking for me, okay?
I can explain everything.
okay, look, all I have in the house is some gauze and ointment.
you're a nurse, right?
you'll do better than I will.
Maggie, I'm not gonna hurt you, okay?
I swear. Look at me.
Sean, you have about a pint and a half of blood on your shirt;
you're gonna need stitches.
you may need a transfusion.
no, you're not hearing me, okay?
hospitals have to report this kind of stuff.
right now, that is not an option for me.
I'll bleed out in the street if I have to.
will you help me?
it's a whole other thing for me to go in alone with a record and all sorts of circumstantial stuff that's gonna make me look guilty as hell.
are nurses supposed to make faces like that?
you're looking at me like I'm already dead.
I'm sorry.
what do you expect?
I don't do a lot of trauma work, okay?
and you have a bullet in there.
I don't want to push it aroundnd make it worse.
Sean, do you understand why this scares me?
I'm afraid that you're gonna die.
you need to get to a hospital.
not tonight, all right?
just get me through the night.
then I'm gonna find whatever I need, and I'm gonna show the cops that it's Tally they're looking for, not me.
Sean, I don't care about any of that.
I'm not gonna die, Maggie, okay?
I can't.
I'm not done yet.
the equation for momentum
is it mass times velocity or mass times acceleration?
uh, velocity.
how long does it take for a pregnancy to show?
Hello?
okay, yeah.
fine with me.
ask the source.
Galina's on her way up.
what is she doing here?
I told her I'd meet her later.
here's what I don't get.
why are you so sure this baby's mine?
is yours.
what about Razmik, your cousin?
is cousin of my cousin, not blood relative.
and we meet one month ago.
but if you haven't gone to a doctor, how do know how far along you are?
women know.
Yeah, but we were always careful.
other times, it is nice and warm.
nothing is open, and we're out of...
okay. All right.
I say, "Be careful.
you say, "Oh, Galina...
okay, all right. Enough.
you say "I am careful.
all right.
enough. I was there.
Yeah, you were.
and now we're here.
I think I'm just gonna go downstairs.
we'll go.
no, I'd rather. Really.
just... figure this out.
there's nothing to figure out.
I'm keeping baby.
I want you to take a paternity test and if you got some problem with it...
okay, fine.
I will do.
the tax return statements for 2003, 2004... Where's 2005?
Beth, when you win the lottery,
I think it automatically prequalifies you to buy most homes.
cameron, I could be on a plane any minute.
I can't bring a baby back to a hotel room.
is this the inspection report for your new place?
Yeah.
do you want me to take a look at it?
you know, honestly,
I'm trying to get out of here, my home, or what used to be my home, as quickly as possible, before Nina drops by.
uh, Nina's not gonna drop by.
or calls.
she's not gonna call, either.
Beth, we're not together.
unbelievable.
after all that.
two marriages, a family, friendship, a partnership, destroyed...
for what?
she had her reasons.
and I have to respect them.
cameron, do you realize how many states we've filed tax returns in?
chasing tenure, I thought, but I have to wonder
were you just trying to get back here?
no, I grew up here.
this is my home.
tell me, did we come back here so you could be near her?
so you could be close to Nina?
no. It's just that wherever we were,
I always felt like,
I don't know, something was...
missing. You can say it.
Yeah, but I swear it wasn't you, Beth.
I get that now.
I just hope whatever it was, you find it soon...before someone else gets hurt.
keep the change.
Thanks.
excuse me, Miss.
you can't eat that here.
please? I'll be quick and I really don't want to go to my room right now.
I'm sorry.
it's a hotel rule.
I think we can bend the rules this time.
who is that?
his dad owns the hotel.
I don't care what size the logo on the follow-car is, just so long as it's on there when we start the race.
do you understand me?
I do not have...
I'm gonna call you back.
I'm sorry to show up like this.
and yet you did.
well, you won't return my calls.
the race is in a week.
everything I have is riding on this.
I understand that.
I just thought that you'd want to know that Cameron and I aren't together.
that we're not going to be.
I ended it.
what, is that supposed to make me feel better?
a couple of rolls in the hay with Cameron meant more to you than me. And our girls.
I can't justify what I did.
Peter, you have every right to hate me.
but there are some things that we still have to deal with.
we have to find a way to talk to the girls, tell them the truth.
what you really mean is you have to figure out a way to tell them what you did with Uncle Cameron, right?
I want to figure out a way to tell them that I'm not coming home.
I've got to get home, Sunny.
Dan Campbell finally called back about taking over as team manager.
but he wanted to talk to you.
I tried putting him through, but I guess your assistant told you it was me calling.
tell him I'll call him from the car.
look...
I know what it feels like to have the rug pulled from under you by your friends, Peter.
I really do.
the day you won the lottery,
I came home from my job here to find a basement flooded and my credit maxed out.
that's when I find out that you guys won without me.
so I went back and I counted.
I hosted more of those parties than anyone else.
every time, I not only put my dollar in, but I made sure that no one got left out.
and practically the only time that I forgot to put my dollar in, everyone wins more money then they will ever need.
and not one of you, my supposed friends, even bothered to pick up the phone.
I told you the truth because I thought you deserved to know.
I told you because I trust you, Peter.
let me give you some advice, Sunny.
if you want somebody to trust you, don't start by telling them a lie.
do me a favor.
don't mix me up with your wife because there's a difference.
that's none of your business.
even after last night?
I believed in you when no one else did, not your best friend, not your wife and I think that I at least deserve a chance to make you believe in me.
you looking for forgiveness, you might want to broaden your search.
you might want to ask yourself who you're really mad at here.
No!
no, stop.
no, no, no.
please don't give me a ticket.
Oh, my God.
of course I know you, Beth.
didn't look like you did.
Beth who puts eggshells in the pastry crust.
that was an accident, you know.
I was learning.
who hates car alarms.
who laughs in her sleep.
Beth-- who is newly separated.
nice to see you, Beth.
I... laughed in my sleep?
you were dreaming.
it was, um...
cute.
nice.
sweet.
Pascal, would you by any chance want to grab a cup of coffee?
the coast is clear if you want to go back to your room.
how'd it go?
horrible.
but she agreed to a paternity test.
she did?
that's good, I guess.
is it?
she said she was only with Razmik for the last month or so, but there could have been other guys.
when?
Damien, you said yourself, all she did for months was wait around the hotel for you to come back to the room.
I said it was possible.
so is the fact that this is your baby.
Frankie, if this test shows...
if it goes badly...
goes badly"?
Damien, it's not a math exam.
that doesn't mean I'm going to be with her.
I'm with you.
none of this feels real.
when that baby's born,
I think it will be the most real thing you've ever felt.
what happens sometimes is, um...
mommies and daddies love each other, but in different ways, and sometimes, that can change.
even though they still love each other, it makes it so they can't live in the same house for a while.
that's what me and Mommy are going to do.
where are we going to live?
you're going to live with both of us, sweetheart.
only now, you're going to take turns.
so sometimes you'll be with Daddy, and sometimes you'll be with me.
here?
when you're with me, you'll be here.
daddy's going to stay right here.
but we're not all going to be together?
no, sweetheart, we're not.
but we're still going to be a family.
and we're going to love each other and take care of each other as always.
only now, we get to have sleepovers at Mommy's house.
you have a house?
for a little while.
it's more like a cottage, you know, like in the storybooks.
do we get to have canopy beds?
shut up, Daisy!
I'm going to bed.
honey, it's only 6: 30.
will you read us a story?
Yeah, of course I will, sweetheart.
I mean you and Mommy both.
look, if you don't have it, it's fine.
I'm not sure if this is the edition you're looking for, but this is the compilation you mentioned.
Yeah, great, that's it. Thanks.
um, how long have you worked at this bookstore?
a couple of months.
I'm finishing my master's.
the hours are flexible, and when it's slow, I can do my own work.
but you're not at the university?
no. I was at nt State.
just have to write my thesis.
I'm camped out at my parents' right now.
my mom's usually at the lake house, so it works out.
my dad's dead.
why am I telling you all this?
I guess 'cause I asked you.
29-- I'm back in my old room, a half-finished thesis on my desk and a poster of Ralph Macchio on my wall.
I think those posters come down.
I just want to take a breather, see the world a little bit, you know?
so that's what you'd want?
I mean, if you could have anything.
uh, I guess.
if you're asking.
I am.
but why are you asking?
Oh, I'm just curious.
just, you know, conversation.
don't worry.
I'm not trying to hit on you or anything like that.
okay.
I'll see you.
I'm only staying until I'm sure the girls are down.
if Daisy can't sleep,
I can handle it.
I should be here, too, Peter.
this is big for them.
and then I'll go home.
I promise.
home to your storybook cottage?
I know you haven't bought it.
you're renting already?
it belongs to Cameron.
he bought it last week.
I wasn't even supposed to be living there.
what were you supposed to be doing there?
he bought this place so you guys would have a place to meet?
no.
then what?
you were going to live there together.
that's thinking ahead.
car crash interrupted more of a long-term strategy.
Peter, he's not even there.
and I don't have anywhere else to go.
because you can't afford a hotel?
because we're broke?
because I spent all the money on the bike business?
you okay, sweetie?
violet left.
Where'd she go?
I think she ran away.
she told me not to tell you.
call the cops.
I'm going to look for her.
honey, what else did she say to you?
Oh, my God.
Where'd you get all that stuff?
I had to steal it from a clinic that I'm volunteering at.
a free clinic.
I'll make them a generous donation.
it's already been taken care of, thank you.
all right.
let's see it.
okay.
what?
all right, well, the bleeding slowed down, so that's good.
what's all that stuff?
Oh, I've just been...
I've been going over the past couple months, you know, trying to figure out if there's any tracks Tally might have left.
so much for that sleep I asked you to get, huh?
I'll sleep when I'm dead, okay?
which is soon if I don't get any help, I know.
I'm not going to make any moves till I at least get some insurance in my pocket.
insurance?
what kind of insurance?
evidence for the cops.
what do you think you're doing?
you can't go anywhere.
the night Zoe died,
tally stuck the money in a duffel bag into a hotel spa locker.
now, a lot of those places have cameras, right?
I figure if I can get a copy of the tape...
Sean, you're not gonna even make it halfway there before you reopen that wound, okay?
you lost a ton of blood.
you have none left to spare.
who's going to get the tape, then?
what's the name of the hotel?
can't believe I'm doing this.
nice move.
I'm sorry.
it's okay. Don't be.
it's the most excitement I've had all day.
so fourth floor, right?
uh, yeah. How'd you know?
I've seen you around.
besides, it's...
I heard.
it's your hotel, right?
in the will.
tragically, Mom and Dad are thriving.
so how long are you staying?
well, um, I'm kind of living here.
that sounds weird, huh?
my sister and I grew up in hotels; that's weird.
Seriously?
your whole life?
four-star freak show.
but we triumphed over adversities like room service, minibars, spas...
so you living here with your parents?
no.
just me.
I think this is your floor.
Oh. Right. Yeah.
listen, my sister and I are going to a party tonight.
you should come.
I have a boyfriend.
and I have a limo. A big one. Bring him with.
he can't make it, actually.
he's kind of...busy... um...with his wife.
you gotta be kidding me.
that sounds... interesting.
car's out front in an hour.
see you then...
neighbor?
this place has the best French food, and you've never eaten here?
no.
I guess you had enough growing up.
you said you lived in Paris.
well, the thing is,
I worked there, but I'm from a small town.
listen, Beth, about the night we met...
you know, I'm sorry.
no, don't be, because...
I... wasn't ready to date or get involved.
I guess it was probably hard to tell that, given the fact that I jumped you.
no, Beth, it's...
I should have said something.
and I really wanted to be past it, so I guess...
I just pretended I was.
the French must have a word for it. They must.
I believe what it's called is "lying.
what?
it's called lying.
is that a Scottish saying?
no, Beth, I lied to you.
I speak French, I've studied in France, but I'm really from Scotland.
I put the accent on as a dare-- a bet, really-- to prove a point.
that you're a crazy person?
no.
all the good chef positions go to French guys.
people think that they're born knowing how to cook and all the Scots can do is make scones that taste like bricks.
is your name even Pascal?
no, it's Patrick.
I wanted to tell you...
before or after you slept with me?
from the second we started talking, but I liked you, and I thought if you knew...
I wouldn't want anything to do with you.
Oh, that's the date right there.
Yeah, that's, uh...
got to be the one.
my friend's going to love this.
and why do you need it again?
well, it's my friend's birthday, and, uh, me and my girlfriends, we're gonna show it at her party.
a security amera video of her going into a locker room?
Yeah, um... it's a...
it's a joke, you know, 'cause, uh, my friend, she's like this exercise addict.
how is that funny?
if you knew her, I promise you, you would find it hilarious.
I'm not supposed to give out these tapes.
I know, and I was hoping that you would just make an exception for this super-special case.
I could bring it home, make a copy and bring it right back.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I just don't think I can.
OK, uh, listen.
uh, right here in my bag,
I have my niece's confirmation gift.
it's a thousand dollars.
okay, so I'll give you a thousand bucks right now for that tape.
this is a little sick, you know that?
Yeah. You want the money or not?
well, if she does show up there, you can call on my cell or at home, okay?
all right.
Yes, I mean, the police are looking, too. -I'm sorry. Let me take this.
Keith? Yeah. Hi, listen. Peter Schaeffer.
about an hour and a half ago.
...a little bit of a problem here.
it's Violet.
she, uh... ran away.
h-hold on.
I've got another call.
Hello?
Oh. Sunny.
Yes, but this is really a bad time.
it's Sunny.
tell her not now.
she says it's an emergency.
sunny, I really can't... -Colin's times were way off in the trials.
the board's called an emergency session for first thing tomorrow morning.
I just thought you should know.
I can't deal with this right now.
if Colin loses this race,
Peter, they're talking about pulling the plug.
okay, not just dumping you, but carving up the entire company, firing everyone.
sunny, I can't handle it, okay?
I'm having a real emergency here.
violet ran away...
sunny, I've got to clear the line, okay?
the police are gonna be trying to call.
damn it.
Hello?
yes...
is she all right?
where?
I'll be right there.
thank you.
is she okay?
she's fine.
she's six blocks from here.
she's okay.
Hey. You don't have to knock on the door.
it's still your home.
are you back with Nina?
what? No.
be honest, Cameron.
did you buy Nina another house, some Italian villa, or a huge engagement ring?
no, what are you talking about?
almost $300, 000 that was taken out of our account today.
Beth, will you please come in?
I keep going over it in my mind, trying to figure out what you told me were lies, and what were truths.
and more and more things just...
don't go in either pile, leaving me more unsure of everything.
I-I...
I'm so sorry.
me, too, 'cause...
I met this guy.
a nice guy.
cute, fun.
but he lied to me.
not a big lie, just...
you know, a little lie.
he told me he was French when he's actually Scottish, and he lied about his name.
are you serious?
well, the culinary community does have a cultural bias in favor of the French.
just go with me for a minute.
right, right, right.
the point is, you know,
I married someone untrustworthy, and because I did,
I now find that I don't trust anyone, including my own judgment.
Beth, that's harsh.
you don't deserve that.
I do, but you don't.
you married a man who loved you.
and-and I wanted to be happy.
I did, I just didn't know how to stop wanting something I didn't have.
you mean Nina.
no, not Nina.
I want to show you something.
I think it'll answer at least some of your questions.
violet, sweetheart!
honey!
Oh, God!
I'm so happy to see you.
you scared us.
baby, never, never, ever do that again, do you understand me?
don't you ever leave without telling one of us.
your mom's right.
we know you're upset, but you cannot leave the house like that, okay?
very smart of you to have that police lady give us a call, though.
I guess that means you want to come home now.
no, I don't.
I want to stay here.
what, honey?
remember when Daddy put one of those in our backyard?
we were so happy.
can't we be like that again?
Oh, honey...
are you gonna make a divorce?
because if you do I think I might die from it.
please.
I went out with friends, and when I came back, I was kicked out.
my credit card's shut off, and Mom left, like, 50 messages for me to call her back immediately.
call her. I mean...
tell her it was just a couple nights.
she got the bill, Damien.
she knows I'm not at your house and I'm not with Dad.
can't you call your dad?
I mean, maybe you can stay with him a few nights.
and say what, exactly?
I know you took cash"instead of fighting for custody of me, but did you save any?
because I really need some.
Frankie, come on. I mean, what else are you gonna do?
you can't go back to New York.
just call him.
get s side of the story.
no.
no, I'm tired of being asked to see everyone else's side of the story.
mom's side, Dad's side...
my side?
look, I know you gave up a lot to be with me, but so did I.
tell me honestly, do you think it's your kid?
I don't know.
maybe.
I'm tired.
I'm gonna call a friend, see if I can crash somewhere.
good night.
heard you need a friend and a place to crash.
is that all you heard?
I can't help you with the, uh, boyfriend complication.
but I've got some sway when it comes to digs.
we're gonna comp Ms. McMahon's room as long as she'd like...
I can't let you do that.
sure, you can.
come on.
kitchen's closed, but I make a mean scramble.
come on.
okay.
thank you.
okay, so we're looking for Tally and the money, right?
watch close. -Okay.
now, that's her going in.
she's got the bag.
right?
now, watch.
there, right there.
you see that, right there?
that's her coming out...
with no bag.
who sticks a bag in a hotel spa locker and leaves it overnight?
how can you even prove that there's money in the bag?
I can't.
but it matches a bag that she left at the police prenct.
okay?
trust me.
there's this, uh, this detective I've been talking to...
this is gonna make her look guilty.
all right, you know, maybe it'll... Oh, the cops might actually do some police work for once.
Sean, what's wrong?
it's nothing. I'm fine.
what, are you having trouble breathing?
Sean, why didn't you tell me?
you're burning up.
okay, just don't try to get up, please. Oh, my God.
Yeah, yes. I need an ambulance at 19 Larch Row right away, please.
you'll check on her, right?
and turn on the alarm so if she opens a door...
I don't think she's going to run away again.
anyway, I should go.
just stay.
they'll...
they'll want to see you when they wake up in the morning.
I can sleep on the couch.
Peter, I'm so sorry.
I know.
and I do love you.
I know you probably think I have no right to say it, but it's true.
and I love this family...
so much.
me, too.
then don't we owe it to them?
and to us, too?
to see if maybe we can...
try to fix this?
my sister lives there.
what sister?
cameron, you have three brothers.
one lives in Minneapolis...
my half-sister.
my father had two families.
it turns out we were the second.
he was married before your mother?
my father never married my mother.
I found that out when I was 11, and before that,
I used to think he just traveled a lot.
and he traveled
he traveled all the way over here, about 20 minutes away, to his wife and children.
his real children.
Oh, my God.
Yeah.
but she talks about her husband.
she's lying.
I guess she did it to save face and to protect us kids.
and it worked until I found this letter that she had written him, begging him to leave his wife.
I don't think they ever knew.
so how did you know where they lived?
the letter was in an envelope.
she never mailed it.
Beth, you say...
whatever it is that I don't have you hope I find.
I-I don't know if I can because I think it's gone.
he's dead.
can... can you just wait here one second?
there's something I want to do.
Mm-hmm. Okay.
Hey.
uh, Cameron.
remember me?
Yeah. From the bookstore.
um, what are you doing here?
please, don't be freaked out.
I know this is crazy, but, um, I-I'm not crazy.
I swear.
that's probably what crazy people say all the time, isn't it?
um, look,
I-I just came here because I wanted to give you this.
this is a... ticket.
for a cruise ship.
Yeah, it's, um...
really a lease on a cabin.
it's like an at-sea condo.
if you're gonna see the whole world, you need at least a year;
you're gonna want to stretch out, right?
finish your thesis.
a cruise?
around the whole world?!
Oh, you got to be kidding me!
who are you?
so that's where the money went.
a trip around the world.
did you tell her?
that she's my half-sister?
no, I didn't want to tear apart her idea of, you know, who her father was.
well... our father was.
it's amazing, isn't it?
giving her something that she could never have had when she grew up with everything you didn't.
who'd have thought that'd be a fix?
it's a start anyway.
Violet's okay?
Yeah, thank God.
look, the board's convening in 15 minutes.
but before you go in there,
I want you to see this.
what is it?
receipts.
for the donations I made to three charities yesterday.
I was going to give a million back to everyone who gave it to me, but then I thought, they're already multi-millionaires, and look how well that turned out.
you know, that's...
it's everything
except what I have in this company.
all I have left now is what I have with you.
sorry to keep you waiting. Ms. Kokorev,
I'm Sarah.
I'm the genetic counselor.
we spoke on the phone.
and this is?
the father.
great.
so, I understand you're of Irish and German descent?
Yeah.
well, that's good.
see, it exponentially decreases your chances of an extreme form of the defect.
defect?
um, what defect?
um... it's most important reason why I'm taking test.
greek side of my family, one uncle, and two cousins they have, um...
sick baby.
is not gd.
sick? What-what kind of sick?
they had, um...
how I pronounce?
it's a blood disease.
now, your baby will inevitably inherit the gene.
but the chorionic vill sampling we're doing will indice how severe-- or not-- the abnormality might be.
are you okay?
should I go on?
please.
let me be clear:
it's very smart that you're taking this test, but there's a really good chance that your baby is just a single-gene carrier...
which would put your pregnancy back into the "normal" category.
how about other test?
for "papa-ternity.
she means "paternity.
Oh, right.
I'm sorry, I didn't see that on the chart.
well, if you just go down the hall, someone will take your blood work.
you ready?
Yeah.
I-I can do the blood work later, right?
because I'd like to come, too, if that's all right.
Yeah.
there.
that's the baby's heart.
Oh, my God, is that a fist...
moving?
Oh, yeah.
would you like to hear the heartbeat?
Yes.
would you like to sit down?
so fresh air maybe?
Yeah.
Mr. Falsone?
can you hear me?
Yeah.
Yeah, I can hear you.
you're just coming out of general anesthesia.
you underwent emergency surgery to treat a bullet wound.
is Maggie here?
Where's Maggie?
ms. Hernandez is right outside.
so how long before he can get up and walk around?
Oh, a day or two.
soon.
and you talked to Maggie?
didn't she show you the tape?
what tape?
Sean, you need rest.
talk to him.
please, just... listen to me.
okay?
why...
would I kill her if I already had my money?
why would I still be here?
why am I still here and it's Tally that ran?
your girlfriend didn't run.
she told us everything.
she...
she told you that I killed Zoe?
tally told us that you threatened her to keep her quiet.
no.
but she knows she's safe now, and she can tell the truth.
she did it, okay?
I swear, I can...
I'd be happy to listen to everything you have to say, Sean, after you've heard your rights.
you have the right to remain silent.
anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
you have a right to an attorney.
you have a right to have that attorney present during questioning...
Hello, baby. This is Sam Franklin.
I was married to him.
Anna, let me help. - What?!
I was after the manager. - You're looking at her.
where is the sweepstake? I want to make bet.
I found your little sweepstake.
you can get off me now.
don't you get that you just being here is confusing the hell out of me?
last night I made some calls to Tokyo and I'm pleased to inform you I'm now the proud owner of Hotel Babylon.
a week ago I was in charge of a range of global businesses, 'living the dream.
now I'm waiting to find out what's left of it.
the one asset I know I still own is Hotel Babylon.
but what do I know about hotels, I hear you ask. Well...
I've stayed in plenty, and with a CV like mine, 'running a hotel should be a walk in the park.
I've been handling people all my life.
I know how to make them happy.'
when the owner guaranteed you tickets, he failed to appreciate the popularity of the show.
or the lateness of the hour.
what is it? A slug.
it's also a classic con.
you eat 95% of your meal, then you put a grub on the plate and complain.
Sam fell for it.
he gave them vouchers for a free dinner.
morning. Did you get the tickets? Great.
thank you, thank you. Morning, morning.
no-one could say that 'Sam Franklin ever let them down.'
Sam. - I've got to take a shower.
I'll be right back down.
as owner, your job's simple
make sure everyone feels valued and appreciated.'
Sam, I need you to sign off some ideas I've had on improving the profile of the hospitality areas.
now's not a good time...Michael.
I tidy your room special, so now it is...
Yes, just give me a sec, Tanya.
Yep.
clean.
give it to me straight.
what have I got left?
hotel Babylon is definitely all I have?
I'll call you later.
and if life throws you a curve ball, 'your job is to pick yourself up, smile and get on with it.'
you roll with the punches and you fight back.
I running late because I was getting ready.
for what? Your coming-out ball?
this my first meeting as head of housekeeping.
I make effort.
head of housekeeping? - Mr Sam promote me.
Wow! Queen of the cleaners. Hi.
well, you'll be pleased to know you missed my "happy to be general manager" speech, but the key points were that I welcome chocolate gifts - and I love a good party. - Me too!
Oh, we're SO going to get on.
on the off-chance that you may tire of another ten-minute monologue from me,
I'd like to open it to the floor.
so, what have we got this weekend?
as I'm sure you're all aware, we have Ed and Erin Martyn staying with us.
Oh, great - How could we forget, when that's all you talk about?
well, I would suggest that the lifestyle gurus and TV celebrities are our premier guests.
chef and I have already looked over their own recipe books and come up with some additional ideas for their joint birthday dinner.
their stuff's wholesome, family food.
you doing wild-bean casserole and brown bread-and-butter pudding?
James run this event like a military exercise.
Gino, I want a bit of this.
Gino, I want a bit of that.
Gino, I want a bit of the other.
and everything in the restaurant has to close at 5: 05 because Mr Slick Pants here, he wants to watch The Ed And Erin Show.
what good have they ever done anyone, eh?
they've changed the way that civilians live their lives, that's all!
absolutely - bringing back old-fashioned values, - home cooking and family meals. - I think they're evil.
what?
they appear as the perfect family and make everyone else feel inadequate.
we've also got the European heavyweight challenger staying
now you talking about somebody who change lives, eh?
I thought he just rearranged faces.
Yeah, he going to rearrange your British challenger's face, that's for sure. Spain going to smash Great Britain, eh?
boxing in gloves is for women.
real men fight with bare fists and teeth!
I think that two men thumping each other for entertainment is just repulsive.
well, you don't need to worry about that.
there's not going to be much thumping.
just a quick bang, bang from Gomez, and your boy Morrison, on his back.
last time out, Morrison destroyed Helmut Schneider, and Gomez has yet to face a southpaw.
what? You think I shouldn't know about boxing because I'm a woman?
Yes.
morning.
sorry, this is a staff meeting.
Yeah.
and you're here because...? - Looking good, Tanya.
my first contribution is an initiative from City Hall.
leading up to the 2012 Olympics, they're seeing how eco-friendly hospitality businesses are, checking their carbon footprints, etc.
well, we already have pretty good green credentials.
well, I for one always recycle my make-up containers.
another small country saved
it's called the Green Pillow Scheme and I've arranged for someone from their office to do an on-site inspection today.
today?!
Well...as Emily says, we've already got great credentials.
he or she will just turn up, tick the relevant boxes, award us top marks.
anyone fancy taking it on? - Me, me!
it's all media hype, whipping up hysteria.
I think it's a key issue, actually.
passion. That's what I like to hear. Thank you, Emily.
inspector will turn up sometime this morning.
OK, that's it.
people don't come to a five-star hotel to wonder whether we're recycling their shampoo bottles or using eco-friendly mouthwash.
do I take it you're not a jolly green giant, then, James?
not a jolly green anything at the moment.
it's a bandwagon.
I need to book four rooms for a friend of mine this weekend.
superior rooms.
we're fully booked. - Just do the Rubik's shuffle.
twist, move and rearrange.
bring two guests up from the third to the sixth floor, two from the sixth to the fourth.
that frees up rooms on the fifth and third floor.
so move one person from the first up to the sixth floor, one from the sixth to the third floor.
that frees up rooms on the fourth, fifth and third floor.
fill them with people from the seventh and you've got four superior rooms available.
what she said. - ??
the guest's name's Foreman, Carlton Foreman.
put it back, Tyler.
Oh! Is it coming?!
no. THEY are.
mr and Mrs Martyn, I'm Juliet Miller, the general manager.
hello - How do you do?
welcome to Hotel Babylon. We're delighted to have you.
we're delighted to be here. Aren't we? - Mm-hm.
well, if you'd like to take a seat, we'll bring you over a complimentary drink while we check you in.
I'd love to see where the party's gonna be.
you want to stay here and get a drink?
I want to stay with you.
Aw! 12 years of marriage and she still can't get enough of me.
Oh, stop.
we have your payment details, so here are your key cards, Mr and Mrs Martyn.
Annie, do you want to take Tyler up to the room?
can I just say I'm a massive fan?
the item you did last week about the mind-blowing holiday disasters...
it was mind-blowing.
The...herd of cows, cliff-top caravan...
Yeah. So when are you due? - Oh, um...about a month.
ed loved it when I was pregnant.
well, there's nothing more amazing than a pregnant woman.
Yeah, you should try it from this side.
Oh, if he could've had Tyler himself, he would have.
all the scans, the check-ups, the prenatal classes -I couldn't get enough.
I hope your fella's pulling his weight.
Yeah...er...he is.
mr and Mrs Martyn, shall we...? - Great.
Bye. - Bye.
feel like I've just met royalty.
I'm going to be sick. - What?
go over this list and be ready to answer any questions the inspector may have.
it's like being back at school. How would you know?
come on. Who's the Anna-baby-father frontrunner?
no frontrunners, but about 700... - Cover it.
maybe I should just ask for the weekend off.
what's up?
she's had her first brush with the country's most famous family.
they made you feel rubbish?
well, they noticed the bump, asked her about the dad, and then she threw up.
welcome to parenthood. Most of the time you feel ill-equipped, inadequate, and the rest of the time you feel nauseous.
talking of parenthood, none of you saw Anna's baby scan pictures.
can we see?
look, you can see its little fingers. Oh!
OK, now, looks like it's got James's nose, but that's impossible.
what about the chin? The head shape reminds me of...
you remember the guy with the dark hair? - Who?
he works with whatshisname. - Who?
I thought that you'd stopped taking bets.
well, we did.
we had. - But we start again.
I thought you were genuinely interested in the baby, but you're not, you just want to win some stupid bet.
from now on, just don't even look at me.
Anna, it's just a bit of fun. - No. It's not.
Oh, come on, Anna, just give us some clues.
is the father tall? - Is he dark haired?
is he black? - Is he someone we know?
put us out of our misery.
OK, fine.
you really want to know who the father is? - Yes.
you really, really want me - Yes!
you want me to come out and say who the father is?
Yes! Yes!
OK, fine! It's him! All right?!
which means I win the money!
so I take it darkness and alcohol played their part in your coupling with Darren the waiter.
Why?
is he not good-looking? - He's OK, but ordinary looks coupled with no money measures somewhere between the Elephant Man and Quasimodo on your scale.
Hey, you.
you have rooms. Yes? - Booked or not, you've got them.
Fernando.
hombre!
come on! - What you doing? Hey!
I your biggest fan! I just want to shake your hand!
mr Gomez. I'm Juliet Miller, the general manager.
welcome to Hotel Babylon.
I'm so sorry about the fan, and I guarantee he won't pester you again, but he is actually our bar manager, so we may need him.
Rafael!
Gabriel!
OK? - Mm-hm.
Fernando! I still your biggest fan, eh?
Hello, reception. Anna Thornton-Wilton speaking.
another one's gone.' - Who is this?
she's gone.'
so have you had an pairs walk out on you before?
loads of times.
I know looking after someone else's kid is a thankless job, but it's hardly rocket science, is it?
what do you want for breakfast, lunch?
want to go to the park? Here's your dinner. Get to bed!
it's easy. - You're funny.
funny ha-ha or funny weird?
weird, definitely.
OK. Let's get you back to your mummy and daddy now.
I'm 11, not two. - Yeah, whatever.
no. Let me phone our office and check out the hopsack-weave linen we featured in our last book.
I think it's going to give the room a much more homely feel.
you're the expert on homely. Yeah.
the chef thought the risotto ai funghi would be a more appropriate accompaniment to the lighter antipasti choices.
it all sounds good, James. I know nothing about wine.
never touch the stuff.
so I'm leaving the choices to your Spanish sommelier.
our who?
Oh, our barman.
I've called him many things, but a sommelier? No, no, no.
Hey, small fry. What's been happening?
your nanny's walked out on you.
what? - Yeah. Tyler rang down to reception and I saw her walking out of the door.
Oh, no! What are we going to do?
er, well, we'll just have to keep Tyler with us for the weekend.
what? While we pull a TV programme together?
while we talk to scriptwriters and producers?
he'll be bored, Ed. Jesus, I'm bored talking to them, and I'm an adult!
darling, we'll sort something. - So what are we gonna do?
we've got all our friends coming to a party!
darling, relax. - We'll just have to cancel.
we won't have to cancel. - Maybe we could help.
how?
well, I could ask a member of staff to look after Tyler, give you time to sort something else out long term.
so do you have, like, a child-minding thing here?
no, but...
how about Anna?
me? - Yes. You've forged a relationship with Tyler?
no. No, not really. - And you could do with the practice.
Yeah.
and it would be much less taxing for you than standing up for eight-hour shifts.
I can lean.
Oh, God. - Tyler? Tyler, what do you think?
Yeah, Tyler. Do you want a bossy, weird woman looking after you?
why not?
great. That's sorted, then. - Thanks.
now, this risotto. I don't like risotto.
I think we should have fish.
tough life, being an owner. - I'm sorry, did I miss the memo about the Neanderthal look-alike competition here today?
that's no ordinary Neanderthal.
that's Don "Pitbull" Morrison and his entourage.
call security. I want this reprobate out of here now!
Oh, shut up! This man is POSING as a hotel manager.
he couldn't run a bloody bath, bloody charlatan.
you don't call. You don't text. - Why the hell would I call you?
good to see you, Sammy. Listen, thanks for sorting out the rooms.
Oh, what are mates for?
anyway, so last I heard, you were in...Arizona, mining uranium?
arkansas, digging for copper.
didn't find any, so I fell into the boxing game.
boxing? - Yeah.
this is my latest charge,
don Morrison, European heavyweight champion.
what are you looking at?
just you...you're not so big close up.
are you Spanish?
I hate the Spanish.
why don't you just shake hands and play nice?
Ow! I didn't know the Spanish were so strong.
call off the fight, Carlton...not.
I'll go get him checked in. - Mmm.
can I have a word, please, sir? - Mmm.
sir, we've got a big problem, and you need to sort something out before Juliet...
um... Is that who I think it is?
who booked him in? - What's the problem?
you arrived late to the morning meeting, so you have no idea that we also have Fernando Gomez booked in this weekend.
fernando who? - You don't follow sport, then?
not really. - Oh.
fernando Gomez is Morrison's opponent in the big fight this weekend.
we've got both boxers staying here? Fantastic!
Sam, you're not getting it.
they can't both be here. Morrison has to go.
Jules? Jules, hello!
Carlton, what are you doing here?
it was Carlton who phoned me for the rooms. He's Morrison's manager.
if you're staying here, we should all get together for a meal, talk about old times.
I work here, actually. - What?
you work...with Sam?
no... Oh, no!
what's so funny?
no offence, but the best thing you two ever did was get away from each other.
now you're working together?
Yeah, and it's going pretty well.
good.
well, I just hope I'm not around when it all goes tits up...again.
funny you should mention you not being around...
why don't you get yourself checked into the room and we'll have a catch-up drink later?
Carlton and Morrison cannot stay here. - Why not?
because at this stage with a fight, boxers are programmed to kill their opponent on sight.
if either finds out the other's here, they'll murder each other.
he has to go.
I can't throw him out.
I owe him. - What? Money?
when we split up, I was in a mess.
he was there for me.
so he broke out the whisky and tissues and now you're honour-bound to help him out?
why do you dislike him so much?
it might be to do with his mentioning every one of your past conquests in his best man speech, or the fact that your golf weekends away lasted till Tuesday.
I can't throw him out.
I thought we agreed that I was going to run this hotel.
OK.
cards on the table.
I spoke to Michael this morning. Hotel Babylon's all I have left.
everything else has gone. - Everything?
which means I'm staying put.
but together, we can make a real go of this place, make some serious money.
what do you say?
this is not what we agreed to, Sam.
the answer I'm looking for is "yes."
and the answer you're getting is "maybe."
I can work with "maybe."
you're being issued with timetables for both the boxing camps.
any deviations from the itineraries by either party and you need to contact me, Sam or Tony, ASAP.
you all know the score. These two groups must never meet.
understand? Never.
Tony! - Let me wish you luck, eh?
beat this Pitbull man, eh?
Hey, hey. Kill him if you have to!
do it for Spain.
it's OK. Go.
mr Gomez? - Mr Morrison?
there's a message from the venue.
time to go.
well, thank you, gentlemen. Have a good day.
right, do something. - Ah, Mr Morrison.
if I could break with protocol for one minute and, um...
ask you to sign this napkin for me?
I didn't take you for a fight fan. - I love a good scrap, me.
if you could write, "To James, love from..."
or just "from" would be fine.
you don't have a bicycle stand?
this is a five-star hotel. - So?
so couriers go round the back.
there's nowhere to put my bike?
don't tempt me, mate. - I'll just have to take it in, then.
at the risk of stating the bleedin' obvious - on yer bike.
I am Robert Carrick, environmental officer from City Hall.
I believe I'm expected.
Congratulations. You've just failed test number one.
mr Carrick, welcome to Hotel Babylon.
I'm Emily James, head of PR. We are delighted to have you with us today.
I did ask for somewhere to store my bicycle.
Oh, that's easy. Tony, bike. Of course.
I imagine you're a man who likes to hit the ground running, so I've set up the most energy-efficient route around the hotel, taking in all the key areas - bedrooms...
I thought I'd take him to the Trocadero Centre, and then get him a burger or something for lunch.
no. No, no, no. He can't leave the hotel without us.
we also advocate a strictly organic diet. No processed foods.
I think he's lactose intolerant.
ed thinks that I'm too fussy but...
"Fussy" wasn't the word I used, sweetness.
so I recommend a limited amount of dairy-based foodstuffs, chocolate being an absolute no-no until after 4: 00, where he's allowed two squares max.
and we all know that fizzy drinks are the quickest way to tooth decay.
and crisps are poison!
now, before I forget, I need you to sign this.
it's just a straightforward confidentiality agreement.
Oh! I don't know.
no, it's routine. All our staff sign one.
it might conflict with the contract I have with the hotel.
I'm sorry. Sorry.
just when I thought it was going to work.
darling, what... - I'm sorry. I...
I couldn't think of putting him in the hands of a stranger.
I could do it without the agreement. - It's impossible.
just call that manager woman and tell her to cancel the party.
darling...
darling, please stop it. We'll sort something out.
OK! I'll sign.
Thanks. - It's all yours.
how much do pirates pay for their earrings?
a buck an ear!
Ta-da!
OK, come on, hit me as hard as you like, eh?
Gino feel nothing, eh?
I wasn't ready.
come here.
what am I supposed to do?
Oh, educate yourself.
Yeah, that's what he said. Why am I always the last to hear?
I'll talk to Chef. - Thanks.
sorry.
hello. I'm Anna.
I know. Darren.
was James OK?
I just saw him talking to you. - Oh, yeah.
he's in a bad mood about the boxers.
they want protein drinks, raw eggs and raw liver.
he never likes it when people mess with the food.
right. OK. Listen, you might find some of the staff have been a little bit weird with you today.
that's because of me.
um, it's...it's a funny story, but they were pestering me to tell them who the father of my baby is, and I...
I told them it's you, which is just ridiculous, I know, because as if I would...
with you! That would... Urgh, no!
anyway, if anyone asks, just say that you are the dad, OK?
cool, cool.
Um...quick, now, tell a joke.
I don't know any.
Oh, you! Oooh! Oooh, you're strong.
all right...Ohhh.
go. Now go.
Oooh, bye! Love you!
what do we have in here?
er, Anna, sorry about the sweepstake thing.
Yeah, yeah, it was. - Yeah.
but you're OK?
Yeah, I'm OK.
Yes. Yes, yes.
I do, too, sometimes.
so obviously he's the one.
Yeah. Yeah. I thought he was.
well, Darren's a nice guy.
Yes, Darren.
Yes. Oooh, he's lovely. Ohhh!
lovely Darren. - Yeah.
did she say anything? And is he the dad?
well, she didn't say that he's not.
the refrigeration system could do with an overhaul to lower emissions.
I've already booked an engineer to have a look at all the machinery.
have you?
Yes, well, the ventilation's inadequate, the insulation is patchy and the lighting is uneconomical.
you see, we take green issues very seriously at Hotel Babylon and I am determined to make improvements as and when I feel they're necessary.
shall we?
hmm. Looks like somebody's after your job.
hmm?
Oh!
have you seen a small boy with big hair? I think I saw him...
what the bloody hell do you think you're doing?!
Oh, God! - Playing PSP.
and you shouldn't swear.
I was worried sick.
you weren't when you dumped me in the lobby.
do you think it's funny, running off like that?
I didn't run. I walked.
Oh!
what would your parents say if they knew I lost you?
so it's my parents you're worried about, not me?
Yes, of course. They're famous.
you're rubbish with kids, eh? - And you're rubbish with adults.
that's because adults ARE rubbish.
Yeah, well, everyone is. Get used to it - I had to.
I suppose you'll want this back.
I'm not gonna agree, Erin!
I'm his mother! - I'm his bloody dad! So what?
what's going on? - They're arguing about their divorce.
I can look after him as well as you!
what? Like you did when I was in Barcelona?
you are such a cow!
are they always like this? - Most times.
and you just have to listen?
I didn't want to still be debating this - at our bloody party, Ed! - Then agree to 50/50 custody and we can go and give all our friends the full happy Martyns experience!
70/30- that's my final offer. Just agree to it.
what? So you can squeeze me out? - You are so paranoid!
and you're a scheming cow! - Should I...?
it wasn't me who had the first affair, sweetheart!
and it wasn't me who had the slutting last!
Hello! Um...
just thought I'd let you know that we're back, and, um...
I'm just going to go, so you guys just...
and I'll, um, see you tomorrow.
um...just a second.
this might be a good moment to remind you that you have actually signed a confidentiality agreement.
she knows that! - Yeah?
I know that.
Mm-hm?
why are you such a cow?! - Because I've been married to you - for 12 years! - God, I hate you!
would you like me to take you somewhere else?
it's OK. I'm used to it.
I'm sorry for being horrible to you today.
you were just being yourself, right? - Yeah.
no taste! The state of you!
the bloody state of you!
you vile...pink bitch!
you slimy... Oh!
as you can see, there are notices in every bathroom telling guests to re-use their towels.
and we all know that's less about saving the planet and more about saving your laundry bills.
the cleaning products you have are chock-full of petrochemicals and phosphates and are so crammed with unbiodegradable oils and lards...
so what do I do?
I would suggest a very large bonfire.
it's the Morrison party back from the Ivy.
and where's Gomez? - Safely sat up in his room.
it's a code green.
Oh, no!
it's OK. It's OK.
what the hell are you doing here?
I stay here. What are you doing here?
I'm here to put your lights out, Mr Gomez!
and I'm here to castrate the Pitbull, Cabron.
do something. - What?
OK, gentlemen, let's keep a lid on it, nice and friendly.
you know, save it for the ring, eh?
Hey!
you're dead... - Wait, stop!
out of the way. - Shut up!
someone get a doctor!
you should've punched! - Yes.
we need to contain this, keep it out of the press.
OK, I'll go and find Emily.
what happens if it's broken?
then the fight gets cancelled, people lose a shitload of money, and I hate to say this, but this hotel is up the proverbial creek without a paddle.
come on, Carlton! - "Come on" what, Sam?
seriously, you booked both boxers into the same hotel!
if this didn't hurt so much, I'd deal with you myself.
I didn't know Gomez was staying here till after you'd arrived.
and you couldn't tell us then?
you'd have felt you had to leave. - You're a moron!
I'd rather have been given the choice and have left because, frankly, with the purse, the sponsorship, the television, the advertising revenue alone, we stand to lose several million pounds, all of which I've got to try and recoup.
so I'm gonna have to sue this hotel.
look, I know I messed up, but... this could ruin me.
Sam, seriously... mate, this is business, yeah?
pure and simple.
anyway, first things first
I need to get Don's hand X-rayed. - I'll arrange it.
Oh, hey, hey, big lady!
"big lady"?
dear me. I've awakened the beast inside.
no, you are not a big lady.
you are a tiny little rose with a little baby inside.
Oh, it doesn't matter. I'm just in a bad mood.
here. What's this?
this is the Mexican AA.
the Mexican AA?
no alcohol, but spicy flavour.
OK.
Oh! You lost your cherry.
here.
so what happened?
Oh. The scars of war.
lucky for Tony that Gino was there to help him out, eh?
come on, tell Gino.
you have a baby on the way.
why are you not blooming like a big, ripe tomato?
it just...it just hit me that I'm having a baby.
I knew that I was having a baby, but I just realised that I'm, like, actually having a baby.
like, I'm going to have a baby.
I don't have anything ready.
I don't have a nursery, I haven't got any nappies.
I went out to buy a cot the other day and I came back with new shoes.
how are new shoes - even gorgeous ones...
they're velvet and have diamante heels.
how are they going to help my baby?
and what sort of a well-dressed mother does that make me?
look, nobody is good with kids until they actually have kids.
I have a son, you know?
Yeah, I know - little Gino. - Oh, no, no, this is another one, in Barcelona. He's 12. Cristiano.
do they not have sex education in Spain?
Oh, yes.
I was a young waiter in a hotel.
29, charming, handsome, virile. A ladies' man, you know?
no, I can't picture that.
well, Martha pictured it.
she was the waitress and we did the naked mambo underneath a bloody red moon.
God!
but I get the wanderlust again, I move off to pastures new.
I didn't know about him until four years ago, when my sister got absolutely bladdered at a party and blurt it out.
what did you do when you found out?
what could I do, eh?
she has robbed me of the chance of being his father.
is that how you feel, that you were robbed?
every child needs his father.
and every father needs his child.
a man has a right to know the truth, eh?
but...but you're OK.
you have your father. You have Darren.
he be very good for...bringing sandwiches.
a waiter.
very useful.
as you can see, we already have an extensive recycling system in place, - so shall we move on? - Wait!
this was in with the brown glass.
looks like I'm going to have to dig a lot deeper.
Ooh!
I hope you've got rubber gloves.
so...what's she like, eh? - Who?
I bet she's like a dark-haired Venus, eh?
Yeah. - Like a tigress, eh?
Yeah, it was electric. - No hanky-panky, eh?
OK? - Right.
OK. Go.
Sam, I need to speak to you urgently about the Green Pillow man.
what's he still doing here?
well, as the day's gone on, he's got harder and harder to please.
what do you want me to do about it? - Well, talk to him.
I mean, it will help... the restaurant.
Oh, joy
red snapper. Where's that from?
the Gulf of Mexico, I believe.
there's also some great British produce, right, James?
the odd cheese, I suppose.
australian barramundi. New Zealand lamb.
Oh, I see you're offering mangosteen from Thailand.
it's an extensive menu of fine dining.
an extensive global menu that's clocking up the air miles and CO2 emissions.
I think you'll find we're no more profligate than any other Michelin-starred restaurant, Mr Carrick.
which is no excuse for complacency.
Oh, I can see I'm gonna be here for some considerable time.
I suppose I should find somewhere nearby to stay overnight.
why don't we organise a room for you here?
I don't think so!
we're eager to facilitate this process in any way we can.
well...
have the room for as long as you like.
Emily, if you'd like to get Mr Carrick checked in.
superior room. - Yes. This way, please, Mr Carrick.
checking up on me?
no, I...I just came to apologise.
it was a crappy thing I did and I'm sorry.
it's all right.
I quite enjoyed people thinking I was the dad. It felt good.
well, I'm going to tell everyone you're not and let you off the hook.
you don't have to.
I mean, I've been playing along. It's cool.
Really?
OK, darling.
too much, right?
way too much - Yeah.
want some more, eh?
want some more of Gino the Bull?
in the red corner, the Bull!
round two. Pow! Pow!
look at the Bull go. Look at him go. He's gonna kill him.
he'll kill him. Bah! Bah! Dah! Gino!
so, I heard about the brawl in reception.
somebody said that you were... What was it?
slapping like a girl. - What?
look, I'll have you know, when I was a young man, I was a boxer, eh?
punched in the head repeatedly as a youth.
explains a lot.
Emily, what room is that inspector in?
Oh...301. Why?
thought so.
room service. Lobster?
Green-lipped mussels? - Mozambique lobster,
norwegian mussels and a very fine French champagne.
you look closely, the cracks always start to show.
I am gonna have him monitored overnight.
but everyone's got secrets. - Good night.
I can't tell you. - But you tell me everything.
hang on.
what's that?
well, they made me sign a confidentiality agreement, so if I do one with you, then I can tell you anything, right?
bring it on.
OK.
now spill the beans.
the Martyns...are getting a divorce.
No! - Yeah.
No!
can I help you, madam?
I'm sure you could. Unfortunately, I'm here to meet a friend.
if you ask at the front desk, they'll help you find him.
Thanks.
what's the world record for owning and then losing a hotel?
whatever it is, I'm sure you're in the running.
given the chance, I could've made a pretty good fist of this place.
come on, Sam, you've been down before.
Yeah, but I've usually had some assets tucked away somewhere before.
but this time...
you've always loved a challenge.
Carlton says that's why I married you.
and Carlton's a real expert on relationships, isn't he?
you've really got it in for him, haven't you?
he made a pass at me when we were married.
when?
you were in Scandinavia trying to get that bottled water business off the ground and he called round and took me out.
I think he thought as he'd forked out for dinner that I owed him something.
and on that happy note...
I'm gonna get some sleep. - You don't fancy another?
no. I'll see you tomorrow.
I thought we were gonna have a moratorium on this subject for the duration of the party.
you'd like that, wouldn't you? Sweep it under the carpet.
we're never gonna agree about custody, are we?
well, not until you stop trying to screw me over, no!
please, don't use the word "screw" in relation to you and I.
it makes me feel unwell.
you're trying to reduce the amount of time I get to spend with Tyler, which I will not stand for, you poisonous...
Hi. Matt! Jody! Glad you could make it.
Hi! Oh, lipstick, sorry. - Catch up with you in a bit.
I will never back down over this.
that's why I made a decision last night. - About what?
I've had an offer from the US to set up a media branch of our business there.
phoned my lawyers first thing this morning, told them it was a goer.
Hi. Glad you could make it.
great to see you.
Tyler and I will be splitting our time between here and the States.
been planning this all along, haven't you? You selfish, conniving bitch!
Oh, I'm so glad you could come! - Hi, Jacob!
what a surprise. I didn't think you'd make it. Great to see you.
one, two, three, four, and four more.
the hand is definitely fractured? - Afraid so.
so I'm gonna have to instruct my lawyers to start legal proceedings against the hotel.
don't do this. - I don't have a choice.
Carlton, we've been friends for years.
listen, Sam, there is no way I can absorb these costs myself, OK?
and the bottom line is you messed up.
all right, look, the only possible alternative I can think of is if we come to some agreement.
settle out of court?
did you have a figure in mind?
it's gotta be a figure I'm happy with.
of course it has.
Hey, Jules, I'm reaching out here.
you're all heart - I'm the wronged bloody party!
tell me something I DON'T know.
OK, can I make a suggestion?
can I suggest you piss off and let Sam and I deal with this ourselves?
did you just tell Juliet to piss off?
Yes, I did. Sound advice.
why don't I make a suggestion?
if you're gonna sue me, then let's do it through the proper channels.
Sam, you are making a HUGE mistake.
no, I made a huge mistake thinking you were someone I could trust.
so it's only fair that I keep you all in the loop.
we may well be taken to court over this, and if we are, it could turn nasty.
I don't remember seeing Morrison throw a punch.
what? - Well, I'm trying to work out when he actually hurt his hand, and I don't remember seeing him throw a right.
look, he must have done.
he's soft, anyway.
I shook his hand when he first arrive, and he cry like a baby.
Gino is, er, stronger than he know.
show me how you shook it.
like this.
Oh!
Yeah, OK, that's like a limp lettuce.
Hey! How could that have hurt him?
he had it cocked, but he never actually threw it.
what, you're an expert on boxing, all of a sudden?
I had an ex-boyfriend who was a boxer.
you went out with a boxer?
I didn't go into a nunnery after our divorce.
what was he? Middleweight? Light welter?
does it matter?
no. Not to me. No.
do you think that Morrison hurt his hand before he got here?
there's a good chance, yeah.
Carlton, just the man we wanted to see.
notified your lawyers yet?
we thought we'd give you a chance to explain yourself first.
explain myself?
is this your pathetic attempt to try and wheedle out of being sued?
no, it's our way of saying we know what you did.
when did you injure your hand, Don?
it wasn't last night, was it?
seriously, you are wasting your time.
something to hide, Carlton?
you knew Gomez was staying here before you came, didn't you?
what did Carlton tell you?
what did he offer you to carry out the con?
all right, look, I want you out of my room now.
it's not your room, it's mine.
not for much longer, mate, if things go my way.
I understand why a devious slug like Carlton would do this, but you don't strike me as a dishonest person.
I'm not.
you're a champion, a great sportsman. You believe in fair play!
Oh, please!
think about this very carefully.
remember what's at stake.
Carlton's priorities lie solely with himself.
when did you injure your hand?
honestly.
a month ago.
I'll call Jake Samuels, see where we stand media-wise.
Juliet, it's started.
I've already been fielding calls from the press about a brawl in a hotel.
then organise a press conference for Don Morrison to appease the journos for the time being.
OK. - Emily!
sorry. Did you have a chance to tell Sam about our eco-warrior's room service order?
Yes. - Has anything else happened?
well, he had told me that he wanted to do a random inspection today.
which is odd, because Tanya says he hasn't taken the "do not disturb" sign off his door.
fine. We should disturb him.
mr Carrick?
he's used every towel in the hotel.
the air conditioning's on full blast. Windows are open.
you are so clever, squeezing a whole night out of them!
Oh!
you had me running round like a blue-arsed fly, - and for what? - I really am sorry, but you should see some of the dumps I usually have to inspect.
so what are you going to rate us?
I think I can guarantee you a four-point rating.
no-one gets five!
Thanks.
now, I'm not going to bore you with a long speech.
I'm going to bore you with a short one instead.
thank you.
thank you, thank you all for coming and sharing this bleakest of moments where Ed and I topple headlong into our 40s.
talking of whom, thanks, Ed, for 12 glorious years of marriage.
and to our terrific son, Tyler.
Aw! - I love you both very, very much.
now, as you all know, Ed's a bit of a nerd
a poetry nerd.
so I asked him to write us a bit of a poem for our birthday, and in a moment of utter madness he agreed.
so before he becomes too incapable, over to you, darling!
darling. - Yes, darling.
thank you, darling.
the end of love should be a big event.
it should involve the hiring of a hall.
why the hell not? It happens to us all.
why should it pass without acknowledgement?
suits should be dry-cleaned, invitations sent.
whatever form it takes - a tiff, a brawl
the end of love should be a big event.
it should involve the hiring of a hall...
from visible to hidden, from door to wall.
thank you.
as you've probably gathered, that's not one of mine.
it's by Sophie Hannah. A little more appropriate, though.
let's give him a great big round of applause. He likes those.
I told him to come back inside, but he wouldn't.
ed, what on earth are you doing?
stay there. - You're missing the party.
good. I hate parties.
Where's Erin? - She's downstairs still.
pouring oil on troubled waters?
that's my girl.
why don't you go back downstairs... - Stay there!
save the full-blown breakdown for tomorrow morning.
she's toying with me.
I don't stand a chance of getting custody, because between her and her hot-shot lawyers, she'll freeze me out.
so how is being drunk and abusive gonna help your cause?
ed, be careful! This is the seventh floor, for God's sake!
what, between the devil and the deep blue sea?
Aargh! - Ed!
I'm just testing you. - How many of those have you got?
what's wrong with him?
he's just a little bit tired and emotional, that's all. Right, Ed?
tired is right.
sick and bloody tired.
Ed! - Mum!
Tyler! - Oh, right on cue!
he's a selfish sod. I'm gonna kill him.
you stay in there, you!
what the hell are you doing?
and what was all that about downstairs?
have you any idea how hard it's been convincing people nothing's wrong?
then don't.
we agreed how we were gonna work this.
but it's all bullshit!
well, this is it, Ed. Yeah? The end.
please! Don't do this! - Yes, the bitter bloody end.
you're a selfish bastard. - So you're calling ME selfish?
Yes, I bloody am.
right, stop! Just stop it now!
all I've heard from both of you is how bad YOU'RE feeling and what YOU want.
but there is another person caught in the middle of this and if you'd stop for one second to think what HE wants or how HE'S feeling...
because I've been with Tyler less than 12 hours, and I can see that this is making him miserable.
it is making you all really miserable.
he doesn't understand what's going on.
Oh, no, yes, he does, because he's had to listen to you every day for months!
he understands better than you two idiots.
so just talk to him.
find out what HE wants before it's too late.
I know the first thing he wants is for you to get off that bloody wall. Get down!
right, now, get in!
now, sit down.
Now...talk.
I'm sorry. Sorry.
welcome, everyone.
I think we all agree that it's been an incredibly frustrating and disappointing 24 hours for boxing fans and for Mr Morrison in particular.
he has a prepared statement that he'd like to read out.
I apologise...to Fernando and his team, to my team, and most of all, to the fans.
I'm a fighter.
all I want to do is fight.
and I let myself be misled by a bad manager and...
I'm really sorry.
thank you very much.
which means we aren't going to America, so I can see Dad when I like.
well, that's good.
if they're not happy, they should split up, right?
Yeah. I think so.
here, you should have this
for when it gets too much in reception.
thank you very much.
is it a boy or a girl?
do you know, I have no idea.
whatever it is, it's lucky.
why do you say that?
because it'll have a good mum.
do you think so?
if it all goes wrong with the dad, promise you won't stay together just for the kid.
OK, I promise.
you sure you're only 11?
right, so how do we kill zombies?
Yeah, so maybe we're missing a trick here.
I mean, after we release the news of the divorce, we could rebrand, become The Ed Martyn And Erin King Show, aimed at the newly separated parent.
looking at how you nurture as single parents, seeing both points of view.
that's good. - I'll phone Pete, set up a meeting.
great. Actually, it's very, very good.
I think you may need this a little bit longer.
I do hope you enjoyed your stay, Mr Carrick.
it's been such a pleasure.
um, aren't you forgetting something, Mr Carrick?
it takes dedication, application and above all, 'admitting your mistakes.'
I thought you were keen to gain that certificate.
what's it gonna do except attract a lot more picky people in organic socks and edible shoes?
Oh, hear, hear!
OK, everyone, let's get back to work.
sorry.
I really think this could work, don't you?
you need to get to meetings on time, run new ideas past me first, be open and straight about any planned changes and let me run my team.
does that mean you're gonna stay? - For the time being.
thank you.
there's a long way to go, Sam. Don't thank me yet.
when all's said and done, we need to learn to ask for help if we need it.'
I just wanted to say if you need anyone to be around for you and the baby...
I just wanted to say if you need anyone to be around for you and the baby...
someone to get things, go to the shops, buy nappies and stuff.
what, like a servant?
I suppose.
Yeah. Mmm.
thank you.
er, thank you...
for making me the dad.
tea, milk, no sugar.
yeah?
what you think? He the daddy?
I think I'd put you higher up my hit list, and that's saying something.
Oh. - You all right?
Yes. It's kicking.
here.
So...are you ready to come clean yet?
what?
I mean, we all know that Darren's not the dad.
and as I am the most trustworthy and reliable person here, and because you're dying to tell somebody...
why don't you tell me?
because it's all very well being strong and self-reliant, 'but some secrets are impossible to keep.'
OK. - OK.
who is Harold Kelly?
Harold stole 12 cut emeralds which he claims he hid somewhere in the hotel.
it's a hoax. You really think there's buried treasure here?
I don't like the look of you.
you remind me of Errol Flynn. Bastard!
you sure you'll be OK? - Got ages to go...Oh!
my waters just broke! - Two men have been killed in the hotel.
I've come home to die. - But there's so much to live for.
where are you? You ain't half picked a day for it.
just need a bit of time just to get my head round all of this.
when you invite a group of gamblers into your hotel
for a poker tournament,
it's bound to have an effect on the staff.
and there's always a chance that things can get out of hand.
what cards do you have? - She's been cheating.
but life is full of risk.
getting to a meeting on time...
Hmm!
or eating in the staff canteen...
two breakfasts, please.
can be full of hidden dangers.
and even the simplest human transaction
carries the possibility of misunderstanding.
Oh, thanks. - Thank you very much.
I've got something for you, big shot.
here's your 200.
next time we meet on the green baize, I taking you down, my friend.
most of us have learnt to manage risk...
well, this place is totally weird.
there's some really big names here
good players from the gambling circuit.
but life can deal you an 'unexpected card.'
what? - One of the biggest hoteliers in Europe.
well, make sure it clears. A hundred million.
Damien Rushby's my father.
Seriously?
well, that makes you hotel royalty.
actually, it makes me feel pretty sick.
sorry, I need to get some air.
it's exhilarating out there today. - Yeah.
almost as cool as when we had
the Swedish striptease team come for the sex Olympics.
did we? - No. But a man can dream.
here she is, the girl that brought us the biggest game in town.
Hey, hey. - Why are you so excited today?
well, gamblers are my kind of people.
we're not afraid to put our balls on the line.
thanks for the visuals, Sam, but try to control yourself today.
control myself?
I know you like to gamble, but sometimes you get carried away???
don't worry. Emily and I are hosting. I'll just be an expert onlooker.
OK. Where's Tony?
I saw him in the corridor. - No, you didn't.
he just phoned me to say he's had an incident in the lift and he's gonna be late.
Emily, what do we need to know?
sorry? What? - About the tournament.
Oh! Um...yes.
the Texas hold 'em is a popular poker variant,
and the hold 'em 50 sees 50 players each paying ten grand a seat.
it's a survival of the fittest knockout,
so the last man standing walks away with half a million pounds.
you know a lot about it.
you get more than a basic education at a girls' private school.
Emily and Sam are the tournament directors,
so they'll be busy all day, as the poker is our main event.
I'd like to remind everybody
that the restaurant will be closed after lunch for the reading.
what? This bloke Bobby Mack?
Yes. He's one of my favourite neorealists, actually.
you know, his latest opus is a staggering...
story of authenticity and genius."Yeah."
I tried to read it. A bit too stodgy for me.
is there anything else??? - There is one last thing.
Arianna Adams is booked in to stay today.
the shipping heiress. Sorry I'm late, one of those mornings.
you do realise that Arianna Adams is not going to show?
she's a phantom guest.
she always books the hanging garden suite every summer.
always pays, never comes.
well, her people e-Mailed me last night, detailing her demands - She never comes. - She is definitely coming.
so, Sam, I need you to vacate the hanging garden suite.
of course. Straight away.
and everybody else, I need you to be fully prepared.
I'll bet you 50 she never comes.
you may want to hang on to your money today, Gino.
so, what did I miss?
Oh, there's some big beasts here for the poker, Tony.
there's bound to be a few rabbits as well.
maybe we could skin a few, eh?
gambling's bad for your health.
speaking of which, the 200 you owe me?
very funny, pretty boy.
it's great to be in London, isn't it?
I know I'm not gonna have a chance to see any of the sights while we're here,
so I'm gonna spend the day channelling what it would be like
to eat cucumber sandwiches on a double-Decker bus, next to freaky dudes in bowler hats.
you're pale. Have you eaten?
I'll get you some breakfast. Keep those blood sugars up.
it's not bad here. The maitred's got the funniest accent.
I nearly lost it when I heard him say, "black pudding and grilled tomatoes."
I'll go find the concierge.
OK, thank you. - Emily.
here's ten grand. I wanna play. Sneak me in.
Sam, I don't think I'm gonna be able to host this tournament today.
what? - It's personal.
I, um...I can't do it with my father here.
Emily, this is your baby.
you know all the details. I can't do this without you.
Er...no. I asked for 39mm clay.
these are too heavy.
I want 8. 5 to 10 gram. - No problem.
look, I'm gonna have to go. He's on his way. I'm really sorry.
what's going on?
we haven't seen each other in over a year.
he's arrogant and he's difficult
and we haven't had much of a relationship since my mum died.
your mum died? - Five years ago.
sorry, I didn't know.
we never really dealt with it,
and then he went and got rid of all her stuff without asking me.
so having him here...
is your chance to put things right.
it's not the time or the place.
shit. - I'll take this.
Hello, darling. - Hi.
sorry I missed your birthday. - And Christmas.
using your mum's name, not mine?
well, it's just for work, it's nothing personal.
isn't it? - You're such a big figure on the hotel scene,
anything I achieve I want to do it on my own merit.
quite right. - So you're here for the tournament?
Yeah, well, I wanted to talk to you, and when I heard the game was here,
it seemed like the perfect opportunity.
Yes. - I thought we could have a chat.
well, I'm very busy.
but I hope you have a wonderful stay at Hotel Babylon.
well, that's what I like to see, a friendly face at reception.
always sets the right tone.
mr Rushby, this is such a thrill.
your hotels are fabulous.
an inspiration. - Oh, thank you.
would you ask Mr Franklin to come up and see me, please?
OK. - Thank you.
excuse me. Excuse me.
I'd like the full English breakfast.
Oh, really, Tony?
and I'd like a pastrami on rye with the pickle on the side!
very funny. Who's Tony?
I haven't got time for this. - Oh.
have a nice day.
Um...do you like this? - Oh, it's gorgeous.
and very expensive. - That's the whole point.
the Italian in 207 gave it to me. - Oh.
but it's not really my style. I was wondering whether you'd like it.
no, I couldn't. - Oh, honestly. It's not a problem.
I want you to have it. Please.
Hey. - Hey.
your dad is lovely. He's so stylish.
where would you like these ghastly chicken wings?
just pop them there.
now, the e-Mail from Arianna's people specifically requested - That we get in some old tiger... - saffron gin.
and some white winter truffles to shave over her hot-Buttered linguine?
Oh, have you got them?
course we have.
you've laid on quite a welcome.
here's to a long and healthy relationship.
that's a very impressive watch.
this? It went up with Apollo 11.
Really? - Yep. It's priceless.
how did you come by it?
I won it in a card game.
are you a player? - Not today.
Oh, shame.
I heard about you buying this place.
very audacious.
it's a tight-Knit community in the hotel game.
most of us grew up on the shop floor together.
but you went straight in at the top.
I was fortunate to be in a position to do so.
these are tough times.
oil spike, dollar slump, credit crunch.
people are finding it hard to keep afloat.
now, I've got 12 hotels in my portfolio
I can absorb these fluctuations.
but what about you? - I manage.
word on the street says you're making a decent fist of things,
but you have liquidity issues and you're not a natural for the hotel game.
I'm sure you don't mean to be rude, but that's how it's coming across.
I want to help you.
I can offer you a way out.
I'll take Babylon off your hands.
I'll give you what you paid for it, plus 10% on top.
not bad in a recession.
Babylon's not for sale.
you'd better be sure of that.
things are only gonna get worse from here.
and I'm not coming back with a better offer.
you may have been in the hotel game since time began...
but you've got no style.
this is just business.
it's not the way I do business.
Dry-Cleaning!
Oh, my... god!
in German mythology, meeting your double is a very bad omen.
well, that's one more reason why I'm glad I'm not german, then!
Yeah. Come in, come in.
Oh, you're the famous author.
I'm glad to see one of us has made something of himself.
it doesn't always feel that way.
I've been signing for the last two hours.
it's been the same every day for the last ten weeks.
Wow! - Yeah.
this book tour's so long, I sometimes lose track of who I am.
Yeah, I know how that feels. Pint with the boys at lunchtime, that's what gets me through the day.
Oh, I miss that old scene.
I used to work in a department store, three years, in New York city.
I used to feel like all human life was there.
now all I see is the inside of a five-Star hotel.
how sad for you.
Yeah, I really have to go, but it was nice to meet you.
maybe I'll see you again at your book signing.
sure. Er, I want you to have this.
thank you very much, sir.
OK.
miss Adams.
I believe you've been expecting me. I'm Arianna Adams.
Hi...Miss Adams!
my people should have sent you an e-Mail with my particular requests.
miss Adams, it's a pleasure to have you staying with us.
we received your e-Mail and everything's ready, so please come this way.
tell Gino he owes me 50 quid.
miss Adams, wait.
Tanya, I need your help.
step away from the lift. - Um...er...
Ben, there are people waiting.
sorry.
I always keep several hotel rooms booked.
I never know which one will take my fancy.
quickly.
wonderful hotel. Lovely staff.
excuse me.
we up the creek without a puddle.
every year I've had her wretched truffles flown in
and every year I've watched them rot slowly and expensively when she didn't show.
me too, with the gin - I had to sell it at discount to the royal
to balance the balance sheet.
OK, OK, what are we gonna do? - Well, I in denial.
I'm going to light a big cigar, listen to some Charles Aznavour
and kiss the roly-poly woman from housekeeping and hope it goes away.
but it's Arianna Adams! - Don't panic.
I'll call in some favours.
come on.
ladies and gentlemen, if you'd like to follow me,
the poker tournament is about to begin.
Hmrc. Spot check on your returns.
what?
we're gonna need invoices, matching receipts, payroll records, going back seven years.
you're kidding.
I don't see anyone laughing.
you look troubled, my child. Could I be of any assistance?
Oh, not unless your eminent can use your bible magic and turn water into old tiger saffron gin.
you get some very exotic types in here, don't you?
we got a big poker game here today.
I always wished I'd learned to play.
had my chance when I was young.
well, against the backdrop of eternity, your magnificent,
we all still young.
can you teach me, please? - Oh, no, no, no, no.
holiness, no, no.
I don't wanna get in trouble with your boss in heaven because I've taken all your money.
please. - No, no, no.
no. How much you want to play for?
I just met your father. - Lucky you.
quite a character.
can you help me find table five?
Hi. I'm Emily James.
I'm Crispin Lloyd. But everyone calls me Justice.
I'll show you to your table.
why does everyone call you Justice?
we all have aliases to make us seem interesting.
I used to be a lawyer, human rights.
Oh, not Justice again. I thought I'd cleaned you out last time.
and I thought you'd changed your name to cashpoint, seeing as you're always giving your money away.
today's game too rich for you, Franklin?
the revenue are here, they're doing a spot check.
I'll come up. - What?!
Sam, we were going to do our opening address together.
you'll be fine.
welcome, everyone, to hold 'em 50 at Hotel Babylon.
this is a massive inconvenience.
we're holding a major event today.
can't we do it some other time?
it's a spot check, you don't get to pick your time.
the hotel was audited last year.
your operating systems are slack and your drawdown facilities are shocking.
but I had the place checked before I bought it.
maybe that check wasn't thorough enough.
two pairs. - Oh.
must be beginner's luck.
Yeah. You are surprisingly good at this.
I think the good lord is looking down on me, - Protecting me. - The good lord.
do you want to raise the stakes?
Yeah, OK. - The game's starting, Billy.
pick on someone your own size. - Oh, no, it's OK. I can handle it.
don't mess with billy the beast. - Billy the beast?
you're not a priest? - I was...
till I gambled the church roof funds and found something better to worship.
come on, Billy.
moscow and Bombay are great cities.
so is London, Rome, Berlin, but we never get to see any of them.
we wait at airports, get on planes, check into hotels,
do a reading of the book, do a signing of the book,
wait at an airport, get on a plane, check into a hotel.
it's like groundhog day. - I know.
maybe after, we could go for a drink or something.
er... er... or not.
I'm going to, er...
go.
it's a catastrophe. - I know. I've tried everyone.
nobody has any white truffles or any old tiger saffron gin.
not that. I just been mugged by a man in a white collar.
Ben, can you lend me some money till payday?
Gino, don't let your mind wander.
it's far too small to be let out on its own.
Arianna's booked into the restaurant in an hour.
what? - Oh, god.
have you guys seen this American author?
he's my spitting image.
lemonade, please.
honestly, he and I are exactly the same.
Yeah, except that he's been on the bestseller list for 40 weeks.
Yeah, and he's sitting upstairs in one of our most expensive suites.
while you're wondering if you can afford the daily specials.
apart from that...
Thanks, guys.
you organised all this?
very impressive.
how long have you worked here? - Just over a year.
head of PR. It's a good job.
a lot of responsibility. - Yes, I enjoy it.
I think it's time you stepped up a gear, though.
manage one of the family hotels, perhaps.
you don't want to be a PR girl all your life.
you see, this is one of our major problems.
you disappear for large periods of my life
and you pop back in at your convenience and expect me to listen to your advice.
I'm sorry, I thought we could catch up.
Oh, right, in between card games.
look, I have a really important job supervising this today
and I could really do without your cosy chats and career advice.
Emily, listen. - No, you listen.
just concentrate on your game and leave me alone.
oi. Where's that taxi I ordered?
I'm just on hold now, sir.
you're about as useful as an ejector seat in a helicopter.
this is not a spectator sport, you know.
sorry, it was a cool phrase.
people say the most perceptive things.
Er...404's luggage is stuck at terminal 5
and wants you to chase it up. And this...
is Brutus. He's 19 and incontinent,
so if he's not walked every 40 minutes, things get very messy.
OK. Thank you, Ben.
Oh, Tony, er...after you've taken care of the roman dog,
could you come up and see me? I've got a request of my own.
Yeah.
dog farts bloody hell.
Oh, you know he's doing a reading here today.
Yes, I do know. That's why I'm here.
I'm his biggest fan. I'm crazy for him.
I've bombarded him with countless letters...
Oh, gosh. Well, enjoy your meal.
get a move on! She's here! She's here!
OK, where's the food dye?
has anyone seen my perigords?
Oh, my gosh, this is never gonna work.
what do you need from me?
you get to meet a lot of people during your day,
with their strange requests.
I thought maybe we could swap places for the day. Cheers.
what, I become the famous author and you become...?
Mm-hm, yeah. I'd really love to do your job, just for a few hours.
seriously, you wanna be a concierge?
I need some variety.
I need a change of rhythm.
you would get to take a break up here.
right now that is rather appealing.
Yeah. I mean, afternoon in five-Star luxury.
get to put whatever you want on my bill.
no. Nice try, but no.
you've gotta do your book reading later on. I'm not a public speaker.
Tony, you're a natural. You deal with the public all the time.
come on. How's your American accent?
my British is pretty good.
you were only supposed to blow the bloody doors off.
it's Michael Caine.
I did not have sexual relations with that woman.
gene wilder! That's brilliant.
Hey, hey, we could do this. - We can?
Yeah. Tony, come on, think about it.
what have we got to lose? What do you say?
watch this.
I soaked these ordinary perigord truffles in oil
and then glazed them with egg to get just the right hue.
old tiger gin gets its colour from being steeped with saffron for years,
but this is the perfect match.
OK, you guys are mad.
Arianna will never tell the difference.
service!
all right, come on.
enjoy your meal, madam.
the moment of truth.
come on, god.
you let your preacher take my money, now you're going to help me.
we did it. We bloody did it.
Yes!
I can't believe I'm doing this.
that is my book of secrets.
it's got every contact number
and every eventuality I've had over the last 20 years.
but if you do have any problems, I'm always on the end of the phone.
and if things get out of control for you,
Paige, my PA, she's a great backstop.
are you and her an item?
Oh, I see. You like her.
what's not to like? She's young, intelligent, hip, slick and beautiful.
if opposites attract, I might stand a chance, though.
I'm afraid when she looks at me, all she sees is a boring old grouch.
speak for yourself.
well, I got guests to attend to.
come here.
thank you. So I'll see you back here for the swap-over at 6. 30.
I must be mad.
OK, Tony, 6: 30.
ladies and gentlemen, 12 players have taken an early bath
and blinds are now going up 50 and 100 after the next hand.
thank you.
chicken wing?
Yeah, I'm only using them as an excuse to talk to you.
I never realised they could be deployed as a chat-up device.
you have to be highly skilled!
do you think you'll win today? - Only if I can shake off Rushby.
everyone's got a tell when they're lying at cards
a small thing that gives them away
and I can usually spot it, except with Damien.
I can't read Damien.
Emily. Sorry. Can you cover for me?
health and safety have turned up. - What?!
like a dog with a bone once they get their teeth in.
buggers to shake loose.
room service, please.
I'd like a steak and chips... oh, french fries.
always a pleasure to see you, Tony.
but I'm in a bit of a rush.
but please do send up the usual.
Oh, the usual? - You know what makes me happy.
Sam Franklin. Can I help you? - Health and safety.
here to do spot checks on your exits, emergencies and extinguishers.
we were checked two weeks ago.
who's your qualified first aider? - Emily James, head of PR.
I want to see her. - Well, you can't.
Sam, I'll deal with this.
I'm going to speak to Rushby.
chip leader at the moment is devil fish.
Damien Rushby is second, Justice third.
this is difficult for me, because family is family and I don't want to intrude.
what? What has he done?
well, as you know, we've had the revenue crawling all over us all day,
and health and safety have turned up with practically the same agenda.
and this morning your father tried to buy the hotel from me.
what?
I was just wondering if these events were related.
I'm not saying he'd... - of course they are.
it's just the kind of stunt he would pull.
he doesn't even pause to think about me.
I know this is tricky for you... - Sam, this is where I work.
this is my life, and he has no respect for that.
we have to get rid of him.
I didn't want to be the one to say it, but, yes, we do.
any ideas?
plenty.
Oh, come in.
room service. - Yeah, just put it right there.
my god, Tony was right. - Who?
no, I'm sorry, you just loOK remarkably like a friend of mine.
is he witty and intelligent?
no, not really.
could you sign this? - Sure.
thank you. Thank you.
Oh, blimey.
excuse me?
you know, Rub-A-Dub-Dub, three men in a pub.
apples and pears, I got big flares.
it's amazing what you pick up on BBC America.
Absolutely.
Oh, this is for you.
thank you, sir. - You're welcome.
I have a feeling some of the problems I've been encountering today
with the authorities might have something to do with you.
no idea what you're talking about.
you're sabotaging my hotel.
I said I don't know what you're talking about.
you know you said you didn't know Damien's tell.
I'll raise your 50, 000.
I'm all in.
that's big money, Damien.
think you've got me beat?
I know I have.
you're bluffing.
I'll call.
the usual, the usual.
er...
I know that you want the usual and that the usual makes you happy,
but I was thinking that we've known each other for so long,
Er...that maybe we could do something unusual for a change.
this is an anthurium. It's my favourite flower.
it's divine.
you know, I was thinking of Iris Murdoch today,
and she said, "people from a planet without flowers" "Must think that we're mad with joy the whole time" "To have such things about us."
I hope it makes you mad with joy.
Oh. Oh.
so much more interesting than the evening paper you usually bring me.
Oh, lovely.
evening paper.
it's just me.
Oh. Whoa.
sorry.
cute boxers.
I, er.
I just came to say you're on in ten.
Oh, OK.
I'm sorry you felt you had to do that.
it's nothing to do with me.
I could hardly miss you whispering to justice.
are you leaving now?
look, I didn't come for us to get into a fight.
you hardly came in peace. You tried to buy the hotel.
do you know why I wanted the hotel?
it was for you.
that is totally crass. Is that your idea of trying...?
I thought it could bring us back together.
just leave.
is everything OK? - This is between me and my...
your necklace.
you can't buy me.
I think you should go.
are you OK?
er, me? Yeah.
sure, I'm fine. - You'll be wonderful.
you've done this a hundred times before.
you see? Two Tonys.
can't be good for the world.
ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Mr Bobby Mack.
pretty spineless of you to send friends to do your dirty work.
no different from you using my daughter to knock me out of the tournament.
you caused me a great deal of inconvenience??
and you and Emily have just cost me a lot of money.
you'd have lost it anyway. - Oh, really?
you're a big game tourist. You shouldn't have been in that hand.
how much have you won at the poker table this year?
not as much as you've lost.
I've won half a million so far, and I don't even need the money.
whereas you're clinging to Babylon
after the shipwreck of your business career.
and you haven't even got the balls to join the big boys to play poker today.
let's play now.
heads up, no limit.
sure you can handle it?
follow me.
as the sky snapped shut like a broken bulb "And the satanic storm gathered to scorn them, his body split, "And she reached deep within him "And wept.
mr Mack will now take a few questions.
who's first? - Ah, yes. Yes.
mr Mack, I've always wanted to know,
when you write "three white mice sit under a juniper tree,"
what exactly is it that you mean by that?
wh-what do I mean?
what is the symbolism in that phrase that you repeat so often in your work?
what is it that you're trying to indicate to us?
um...
that's...
what I mean, when I wrote that,
um...I, um...
what I'm trying to...say...
is that there's three white mice and they're sitting...
under a juniper tree.
er, do you understand?
Yes, I think I do now.
I think I do finally. Thank you so much.
well, that's...
anyone else?
how much are we playing for?
how much have you got?
enough.
Thanks.
thank you so much. - Pleasure to meet you.
thank you so much, Mr. Mack.
that was such an honour.
I've been wanting to meet you for such a long time.
Arianna Adams. Did you receive all my letters?
er...you know, everybody's been so kind,
but I feel the creative muse is upon me.
I'll get your things. - Thank you.
I can feel the flames of inspiration are licking at my heels.
I must go write.
thank you.
pleasure to be of assistance. Let me know if I can help you in the future.
case is closed. - Right.
miss Miller, all done.
what's going on?
Oh, my father sent them in to give us the squeeze
when Sam wouldn't sell Babylon.
he seemed so charming. - Yeah.
well, we don't have to worry about him any more, he's gone.
actually, I saw him playing cards with Sam down in the canteen.
What?!
three jacks. I win.
what is he doing here?
we're playing cards.
I wasn't talking to you.
fantastic, Sam. Now you're playing poker.
just sorting a few things out.
Sam, the whole point was to get him out of the hotel.
relax, both of you.
I'm winning. He's much more fun now.
raise.
look what they did to me.
Oh, my goodness.
what will Bobby Mack have thought?
I've never been so embarrassed in all my life.
I'll call a house doctor.
it was the old tiger saffron gin.
Really? Does it always do that?
no, it never does that.
and I have never had a more bizarre-Tastingwhite winter truffle.
what are you saying exactly?
well, you're the manager
you tell me what's going on.
I'll investigate immediately.
Yes, do that.
but I'm leaving in the morning
and I will never set foot in this hotel again...ever!
I couldn't have won without your help, giving me Damien's tell.
well, I'm just glad it's all over.
I'm extremely grateful.
and, look, I wanted to ask you something.
Oh, you did?
Yeah, I don't know if you're free tomorrow night.
I might be.
there's another tournament. I thought you could come along.
What?!
well, there's this guy there who bluffed a house, beat my flush,
and I thought maybe you could watch him, spot his tell.
Congratulations. - Thank you so much.
you want me to be your spotter?
Yeah, I really need to take him down.
you really need to get a life.
Hey, Paige. - I sharpened your pencils.
Why?
you said you wanted to write.
you like your pencils to be sharp.
Er...well, I could have done that myself.
I like doing it for you.
well, you needn't go to all that trouble.
it's my job.
um...
when was the last time...
you and I had a drink together?
we've, um...
never.
king Lear? It's awesome. I saw it in Chicago.
it really captures the anguish of a fond, foolish old man
trapped between obstinacy and pride.
you're gonna love it. Oh, I'll book those tickets. 504?
tea break.
now? It's getting late.
Yes, if you're six years old and getting ready for bed,
but you're Tony and you never miss a cup of tea.
now, come on. You're buying.
Oh, shit.
right, you lot, here.
I know what you did. I pulled the same trick myself to fake foie gras
in a hotel in Harrogate once, but I was young and stupid. What's your excuse?
we didn't have her requested items in stock.
that is not good enough.
you look at us with the eyes that would make a weak man die,
but you must believe.
I swear on the grave of my beloved.
we never believed that Arianna would come here today.
and she hasn't for the past three years. Look, it's not just us.
she has bookings all over town that she never keeps.
well, she's threatened to cancel her entire booking.
this is serious. She buys our suite for ten weeks every year.
that is guaranteed revenue.
now, has anyone got an idea of how to talk her round?
Tony, look, you're the brains here.
think of something. This is Arianna Adams, we cannot afford to lose her.
the shipping heiress? - Yes, Tony.
Oh, then we've lucked out.
I mean, I know what that's about, yeah, sure, sure.
I can think of a plan. I can think of a good plan.
geezer.
so, um...
put something straight for me.
why haven't we done this before?
I guess because I'm just a ditzy gofer and you're this...
incredible genius.
well, I haven't been smart enough to notice you, have I?
well, you're a busy man.
but you're smart, funny, beautiful.
if I had real brains, I'd wanna hang out with you the whole time.
I worry I'm...a little out of my depth with you.
and I think I'm a little out of my league with you.
what?
I'm worried that when you look at me all you see is a boring, middle-Aged grouch.
that's not at all true.
well, maybe if opposites attract, then I might have a chance with you.
a chance for what?
to kiss you.
you have every chance.
Oh, um...
you know, I'm gonna be back in a sec.
what?
Tony, this is very high-Risk. Are you sure you're up to it?
well, you just introduce me as the author and let me do my thing.
Hello? - Bobby? 6: 30.
things are kicking off.
Oh, yes... I'm a little bit busy right now.
I could really do without you being late.
well, yes, madam.
I'll have those...clothes with you very soon, OK?
Bobby... - Yeah. Bye.
OK? - Yeah, yeah.
OK. Here we go.
good luck. - Thank you.
should I do that up, do you think?
we'd like to make amends for our foolish mistake,
um...so there's someone here I think you'd like to meet.
do it.
Oh, my god. At last. I don't believe it.
I understand from your letters,
all your letters, that you're my biggest fan.
your books are extraordinary.
well, you know, some critics find them diffuse,
but they're really just intended as a response to the resurgent atavism of cultural structures.
you know, it's always been my ambition to elevate the language of schematic loss.
do you think that loss can be schematic?
Oh, yeah. - We'll just leave you to it.
thank you so much. I can't tell you how happy I am.
Yes!
where were we? - Oh, um...
I don't remember.
well...I was just saying how you had every chance to kiss me.
but if you're not gonna take that chance...
do you mind if I kiss you?
uh...you know...
Um...could you, um...
you...
put you here.
now, just stay there.
hold that thought. I'm gonna be right back.
you are gonna be very popular with your boss.
Why?
well, I impersonated you impersonating me.
it's quite complicated.
are you wearing lipstick? Mmm?
OK, loOK, don't be upset, but I noticed that you and Paige
liked each other, so I laid a bit of groundwork.
you kissed Paige?
no. Strictly speaking, she kissed me.
but the good news is she thought she was kissing you.
it's quite complicated.
what? What does it mean?
she definitely likes you.
Really? - And you like her.
thank you. - You're welcome.
I'll raise you 500.
you.
you are a genius.
how did you know Arianna was such a big fan of Bobby Mack's?
Yeah, all your "resurgent activism," eh,
and your "schemy loss," eh, Yankee boy?
now, I don't know what you were talking about up there,
but I've just spoken to Arianna, and she thinks she's met
her literary hero and she's keeping her booking.
Yes!
can you be quiet? We're trying to play some cards here.
what's going on?
your bet, Franklin.
you've got no money. I'm not walking away.
I'll write an IOU that will match any bet you make.
OK, let's raise the stakes.
all this...
plus Babylon.
for any one of your hotels.
Sam, you can't. - Keep out of this.
you came here to take my hotel, now I'm gonna take one of yours.
don't you dare accept this bet.
are you gonna name one? - No, he's not, are you, Damien?
the Crawford.
bit pompous for my taste, but it'll do.
Tanya, the river.
full house.
that's a very good hand...
but not as good as four kings.
uh...my solicitor will be contacting you with the paperwork.
what the hell just happened in there?
I thought it was my way back.
a pissing contest with Damien? - It's not...
he tried to walk all over me. I had to show him he couldn't do that.
it was a calculated gamble.
there's no such thing.
but if I'd have won, I'd have doubled my assets.
you lost.
it was bad luck, Juliet.
you can't build a life on luck, Sam.
give Sam his hotel back.
that's...not how gambling works.
this wasn't gambling.
you came here specifically to get Babylon.
Yes, that's what I wanted.
didn't you think about me? - This is all about you.
Well...answer these things about me, then.
who's my best friend? Where's my favourite place?
why does Chinese food make me sneeze?
we certainly drifted apart.
you don't know me, and you came here to buy Babylon so that you could give it to someone
who doesn't even want to be a hotel manager!
look, let's not talk out here, please.
I thought it was a way that we could spend more time together.
if you want to spend more time with me, don't buy a hotel as an excuse.
I'm sorry, I got it wrong. - Give Sam back his hotel.
you don't understand. He's a proud man.
it would crush him, being in my debt.
believe me, there is nothing I can do.
how'd it go?
he doesn't know how to give it back to Sam.
sorry, does any of this macho posturing make sense to any of the men in the room?
stop the funeral, I think I can save the hotel.
you're not gonna like it, but it's the best we've got.
OK, this is what we're gonna do.
hold the doors.
you're leaving us? - I've got what I came for.
title deeds to the hotel.
I was gonna get myself a drink before I left. Can I buy you one?
it looks like we could both do with one.
they're playing my song.
Hi. I've called the mechanic, but he'll be a while at this time of night, so I'll bring you some drinks, ok?
the booze is in. - Stage one complete.
played my first game when I was ten. My father cleaned me out.
told me I should learn that poker doesn't pay.
shame I didn't listen to him.
I've achieved quite a lot in my life,
but I've never been a successful father.
not that it's my place, or anything, but...
she's a very special girl. You should take time to get to know her.
I wish I had time.
bad news, I'm afraid???
the engineer's delayed, so you're gonna be stuck a while longer.
I've brought you some magazines, playing cards, radio.
I'll let you know when they arrive.
how's it going up there? - They've got the cards.
the rest is up to Sam.
hold this for me, will you?
I'm gonna try and get these doors open further.
we can't just wait all night, sitting on our hands.
we could play cards.
not a good idea.
wouldn't you like to win back Babylon?
Yes. - Well, now's your chance.
I'll bet you one hand - The hotel for this watch.
you wanna take everything I've got.
I've already got 12 hotels.
if I want another I can buy another. But this watch...
went to the moon.
OK.
we're gonna play Indian. You get one card...blind.
highest card wins. You get one change.
OK.
on three.
do you want to change?
no. You?
Mmm.
help. Help me!
was there supposed to be a second alarm?
I don't think so.
no, there wasn't.
hurry up. Hurry up!
Oh, my god, Sam, what's happened?
I think he's had a heart attack. Call an ambulance.
get these doors open!
ambulance, please.
Oh, god!
pull. Pull, guys.
he's stopped breathing.
Tanya, pass the defibrillator.
it's in a red box. - The red one!
Sam, I'm gonna pass this to you. Open it and I'll tell you what to do.
pull where it says "pull."
the plastic thing. - This?
and rip it off. - Yes.
OK, there's two pads. Put them on his chest.
OK.
can we turn it on? - OK, turn it on.
OK, it's charging.
OK, here we go. Here we go.
anything?
he's not breathing.
he's not breathing.
Tanya, I need the adrenalin. It's in a long plastic thing.
it's blue. LoOKs like a blue pen. - Come on.
that's it. - Here it is! Here it is!
get it in, get it in!
Oh, god! - OK, just slowly.
you're gonna be OK. You're gonna be OK.
he's not breathing.
dad?
daddy. Daddy, you're gonna be OK!
so that was a heart attack.
it...it wasn't unexpected. I had one four months ago.
you didn't tell me. - I didn't know how.
I could hardly tell you on the telephone or in an e-Mail.
that's why I came here.
I'm sorry.
apparently I have a chronic condition.
but I won't waste the last months of my life
without us ever getting to know each other.
I just...could never find the words to say...
to say what?
that i...
love you.
you just said it.
it's very simple, really, isn't it?
I mean, it's much cheaper than buying me a hotel.
wait.
want to know what card I had?
welcome back to the hotel business.
OK.
the best risks we take in life
are not when we gamble with money or possessions,
but when we're brave enough to risk our feelings.
what's happened? - Will he be all right?
don't worry. I'm sure he'll be OK.
can I get you anything? Taxi? Tickets for a show?
Oh, no, no. I think we're fine, thanks.
well, let me know if you need my help.
I suspect you've helped us enough already.
I think I've got it from here, thanks.
because if we win that gamble...
we get the biggest prize of all.
I need to collect all his stuff and bring it to the hospital for him.
is he all right? - I don't know.
I have to wait and see.
are you all right?
Yeah.
and you're gonna be all right together?
I hope so.
I really hope so.
maybe you'd like to come to my room.
your room?
we're hosting an entire convention with a skeleton staff.
the captain stranger appreciation society.
Oh, no. Not geeks.
this is Meredith Sutton, she's gonna be working with us for a few days.
you're Michael... - Martin.
who is this Meredith, anyway,
and has she facilitated your sleeping with her, by any chance?
morning. - Good morning.
Ahoy.
this is never gonna happen between us. There's too much history.
I resign.
technology will change the earth.
and this is the future right here.
you want to watch "the exorcist" from the comfort of your own couch?
they'll get $1, 500 each on the blackarket, easy.
I want to get this done quick-like.
screw it up, you might as well slit your own throats and throw yourselves into the Hudson.
top o' the morning to you, big patrick.
get down!
lose the guns, leprechauns!
get on the ground!
get 'em boys! Get 'em!
there are always a few that think they're faster.
not usually the Irish!
the Italians like a good sprint.
there you go.
and there you go again.
that's for making me remember I had asthma when I was a kid.
all right?
shut your mouth and keep walking.
it's Bono, you scuzzy knacke it's Irish.
my name is sam tyler.
I was in an accident, and I woke up in 1973.
I don't know how or why I'm here, but whatever's happened, it's like I've landed on a different planet.
now maybe if I can work out the reason,
I can get home.
let's move it, ya bums.
look at that.
I love a woman in uniform.
I bet you have a very fine set of fun bags nestled warmly there, huh?
like two ferrets fighting in a sack.
Oh, the beautiful irish boys you'd bear, huh?
not much in the way of birthing hips, though, does she?
no, the skinny ones never disappoint me, Patrick.
mind your manners, junior.
apologize to the lady.
there's a difference between bravery and stupidity.
now apologize.
sure.
sorry, love.
let's go.
I'll give you points for realism, Tyler.
but next time you elbow me in the gut,
I ain't pulling my own punches.
sorry about that, boss.
Yeah.
you had me really thinkin' you were Irish.
you're good at accents, like rich Little.
what the hell you been doing these past two weeks?
you smell like flipper after a 5-day herring bender.
Yeah, well, I look like a longshoreman who's been unloading ships full of fish all day.
what do you got besides blisters?
well, big patrick's been cherry-picking guys off the docks for covert jobs.
we were off loading these black market V. C.R...
R.
,uh, those gizmos, when you guys arrived.
what about Jim Mcmanus?
McManus hasn't made an appearance yet, but I heard some talk about that truck hijacking three weeks ago.
it was Mcmanus and his crew who jacked that trucoad of electronics.
I knew it.
Yeah, well, the truck hasn't turned up yet.
rumor is Mcmanus himself pulled the trigger on the driver's murder.
it fits his vicious M. O.
pumped fourounds into a lifeless body when anyone else would have stopped at two.
like I said, it's just hearsay.
you get closer, you watch yourself.
McManus has been known to sniff out less noble rats before.
he has marshmallow guns, knives and coffins in his bowl of lucky charms every morning.
he's magically malicious.
fair warning.
fair warning, Tyler.
okay I better get back out there.
get him back to his chums.
Oh, boss, uh, one more thing
maybe I should get a shiner or somethin' for appearance's sake.
Yeah, you should.
ray. - Yeah.
you got it.
there aren't any ashtrays in here, are there?
what are you doin'?
Oh, boy.
stand up.
you picked, go to the right.
you ain't, go to the left.
skelton - is that an Irish name?
Yeah.
you became a cop.
you must have made your mama so proud, huh?
okay, homebound goes left, floppers go to the right.
you, homebound.
homebound.
flopper.
homebound.
flopper.
who's the scrappy one?
all right. All right. Come on.
easy there.
scrappy, come on with us.
back off, scrappy.
back off. All right?
come on. Sit down and have a drink with me.
you got a name, or you want me to call you scrappy?
Dublin-the accent?
Yeah. Sandycove.
there was a place my pop used to talk about called the, uh, the fifty foot.
said it was a nice swim spot then.
you familiar?
uh, I think you mean the forty foot.
For-what was I thinking?
man, what was I thinking?
you got a brain on you. I like that.
I tell you what.
let me introduce you to some of the boys, huh?
here, these mooks.
we got Patrick.
another Patrick. - Patrick.
that's Sean. - Sean.
and this here is drunk Petey.
Jimmy boy.
can I trouble you for a pint?
your sister ain't having it.
she cut me off clean.
Yeah. That's because you're a serious neddy, drunk Petey.
come on. Piss off, okay?
business discussion here, okay?
with this muck savage? - Oh, no.
yodel yo. - co on, drunk Petey. Let's go.
so you good with anything aside from those, uh, elbows?
name it.
how about your dukes?
anyone, anyhow, anywhere.
okay, what about right now? Patrick?
easy.
no. Big patrick.
Hey, Paddy boy.
no here says he can crush you, fist to fist.
is that right? - Yeah.
go easy on him, okay?
come on, Paddy!
come on, Paddy!
come on!
come on!
wow, Sammy.
in Irish tarot, that - that's a symbol of possibility.
cool, right?
hello.
mommy's home!
Hey, there's eggs in the B.
Hello, my sweetie.
I thought I said no more readings.
you know they only confuse him.
I know. Okay?
but he got the ace of pentacles.
what does that mean?
it means he can make all your dreams come true.
glad you're here.
you know, I was scared we'd run out of drunken Irish hoodlums today.
this is my joint.
I'm - Colleen.
Yeah, that's right. How'd you know?
Oh, I-I overheard a couple of lads going on about a bottle of smoke that works the bar here, named Colleen.
well, pick yourself up.
dust yourself off.
you're a good 2 pints behind the masses.
you through playing nursemaid?
hump off.
two rules, Bono
Twrules that keep anarchy and chaos outside of this bar.
One-we're a family first and foremost, and don't you forget that.
and two-don't even think about making nice-y with my sister.
here you go.
Yeah, that'll ease the pain.
Jimmy? - Yes?
when will I get some work?
eh, relax your cacks, okay?
I do admire your enthusiasm.
no, I'll tell you what.
go to this address tonight at 7: 00. Okay?
be on time.
tell 'em jimmy sent you, and you follow their instructions to the letter.
thanks for this, boss.
Thanks, boss?
you say that like I just handed you a glass of water.
all right, listen, listen, listen. Don't talk.
here's the thing, Bono... - Why are you reading the obituaries?
the least they could do, you know, print their last words, don't you think?
the toughest men I ever seen croak
I'm talking about the diamond-hard bastards, the stone-cold killers
you know what their final words were?
mommy. Mommy.
I don't just put anybody on my team...
hey ray, You believe in hell?
Yeah.
Sunday dinner at my mother-in-law's with her new friend gus, who has a goiter and an undercooked ham.
come on. I'm serious.
I am, too.
the goiter and the uercooked ham look very similar.
I'm always afraid I'm gonna stick my fork into the wrong pinkish blob.
in hell, you think they got flames everywhere?
you want hell?
I'll give you hell.
hell is sitting three hours on a stakeout with a jibber-jawing jackass who's come down with a bad case of "what's it all about, alfie?"
this is interesting.
Jimmy sent me, said I should follow your instructions.
come on in.
so...
are you as good with a hammer as you are with your hands?
well, uh, that depends on the job.
do you know what I mean?
hanging a mirror?
Yeah.
that brother of mine - he's got some sense of humor.
I'll go get a hammer.
detective skywalker?
what-what are you doing here?
Hey, Rose.
there you are.
Sam, this is, uh, this is Rose Tyler, my new neighbor and friend and the mother of the most beautiful little boy you've ever seen in your life.
uh, rose, this is Sam Bono.
uh, nice to meet you...Sam.
bono. Sam Bono.
well, Sam works for Jimmy.
Yep. Nice to meet you, Rose.
any friend of Colleen's here is me auld segotia.
uh, your accent...
it's driving you wild, huh?
Yeah, you and the rest of the lashes.
you know, do you want a drink, Sam?
only if you want to see a grown man overcome with gratitude.
what is going on?
I'm workg a case, undercover.
please don't blow it for me.
what are you doing here?
no, what are you doing here?
I-I just moved in next door.
you know, with Vic gone, the rent on the old place was...
well, a smaller apartment was all we needed, and-and Colleen watches Sammy sometimes, when I have to work late.
Oh, here we go.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
I-I really should get going.
you know, it's gonna take me forever to get Sammy to leave.
I think he has a crush on Colleen.
I think so, too.
well, I mean, who wouldn't?
find a pay phone?
Yeah. I spoke to Annie.
this address is where Jimmy's sister lives.
what, the bartender?
Oh, man, she is one witchy wildcat.
you ever seen her? - No.
how come Tyler gets all the plumb undercovers?
we get diamond district rabbis and busboys.
remeer when we had to pose as nursing home workers?
still got the smell of granny poo on my loafers.
I bet he's up there right now, getting "in" her "cognito."
Slinte.
well, I think it's about time we hung the mirror.
look who's awake.
Hey, Sammy.
Hey, sweetheart.
Oh, are you ready to go home?
Sammy, this is Sam.
Sam, this is Sammy.
nice to meet you, kid.
all right, say- say good night, Sammy.
good night.
good night. - Good night, yeah.
Thanks, Colleen. - Sure.
God, can you believe you were ever that young?
no.
sometimes I think irrived here fully grown.
so, uh...
do you still shuffle an Irish tarot deck, do you?
I do.
how do you know that?
Oh, uh, one of Jimmy's boys mentioned it.
they thought it was odd.
well, you know what? If any one of them had an ounce of the mystic in them, maybe they wouldn't be so all-day angry.
it takes a keen eye to hang a mirror.
a little bit too much to the left, a little bit too much to the right, and it all gets banjaxed.
well, clearly Jimmy hired the right man for the job.
well, I should be off.
detective skywalker.
uh, or sam or whoever you are right now.
I'm-I'm sorry about that.
I just wanted to see how you guys are doin'.
Oh, we're fine.
well, aside from the fact that my son thinks his father's on a very long business trip.
and I don't know when or how to tell him otherwise.
um, is-is Colleen in some kind of trouble?
if so, I'd really like to know.
well, all--all I can say is that her brother's mixed up in some shady stuff.
so do me a favor.
stay away from her, okay?
okay, I'll do that...
thank you. - If you'll do something for me.
of course. Anything.
will you talk to Sammy?
talk to him?
I...
about what?
I'm worried.
he's changed since his father left.
you know, he's angry.
he threw a rock at a neighborhood boy last week.
you were right, detective, about Vic.
you warned me, and you were right.
Sammy needs a man in his life, a good man, like you.
just to talk to.
I'm doing everything I can, but...
rose. - Will you will you please just-just talk to him?
please.
it would mean so much to sammy and to me.
I'm sorry. I,um...
I'm sorry.
I really want to help you, but I can't do that.
okay.
I'm not sure I understand why, but, um,
I can't say that I'm surprised.
since we've met, you've been nothing but a-a puzzle with several lost pieces.
Oh, Rose. - Thanks anyway.
well, listen. - Just...
I still need you to stay away from Jimmy Mcmanus.
do you understand?
you and Sammy both.
mommy.
I had a bad dream.
he can hardlsleep.
he's afraid of his own dreams.
good night...
Mrs. Tyler.
she was your babysitter. - Yes.
crazy Jimmy Mcmanus' sister, Colleen, was your babysitter back in- no, here in 1973.
that's right.
and I didn't realize it at the time or even later.
in fact, it only just occurred to me when I saw her today.
but she pretty much forged my taste in all the women who came after her.
Really? - Yeah, well, one's formative years being so crucial and a that, you know.
so does Maya look like her?
um, no, not at all.
and now here she is.
she's Jimmy Mcmanus' sister, and she's living next door to my mother, - so I can't help but think - oh, please don't say it.
what? - Don't say "maybe that's why I'm here, " because you keep saying,"maybe that's why I'm here,"
and every time you say it,
I think maybe the reason you're here is to drive me utterly insane.
okay. Look, I know this all seems like nonsense to you, the ravings of a lunatic.
I appreciate that.
you know, you've tried to go there with me, you haven't called the men from the funny farm to take me away.
not yet.
you kept my confidence.
I am so grateful for that.
so I can only promise that if I ever do get back to 2008 or 2009
or wtever the hell it is right now,
I will make it up to you.
I'll take you out for sushi at Nobu.
I will fill your ipod with the entire Justin Timberlake catalog.
I will fly you down to the epcot center to show you the spaceship earth.
okay.
okay? - Okay.
okay. - It's a deal, Sam.
uh, if you ever get back to wherever you're from, you can take me with you and do all those things.
okay. It's a deal.
it's a deal.
what is sushi?
I think that Sam's plan to work the sister has got nothing to do with the case and everything to do with her ass.
I can handle the silent treatment, believe you me.
I married the eldest Stovack sister.
ignoring me for days on end is the favorite weapon in her arsenal.
I ain't gonna crack, Junior.
all right.
fine.
on the subject of the afterlife, here is my opinion
depending on how we behave here on earth, we either go to heaven or go to hell.
in heaven, it's all dancing girls, ice cream sundaes, rivers of bourbon, led zeppelin music, no one's allowed to wear any clothes, you have to have sex at least ten times a day and eat pizza when you're not having sex.
it's like a rule there.
well, so what's hell?
hell is just a great big window you have to sit behind all day long and watch what goes on in heaven.
yodel yo.
Jimmy sleeping one off?
no, he don't get up until the corned beef's on the table.
not that I think you're really here looking for Jimmy.
am I that transparent?
you drinkin'?
always.
what makes you think I want anything from you?
well, men only talk to women for two reasons.
when they want their house cleaned or their mouse cleaned.
true, I could have you any time I wanted.
Oh, you think so?
Oh, I do. - Why?
because you fancy yourself some tough guy?
I mean, do you really think that's appealing to Jimmy Mcmanus' sister?
I mean, I grew up around all these hard shells with their fists and their guns and their anger.
do you think I find that even remotely attractive?
well, I also make, uh, lace curtains out of dried pineapple rings.
you're getting warmer.
woo me.
W-woo you?
I need woo.
not here.
maybe we should go to your place.
Sammy and Rosie live right next door.
what if little Sammy hears?
his bedroom's right against the wall.
trust me.
he won't mind.
so you know, I'm not a loose boot.
I was the only girl at St. Edmund's...St. Spreadmund's Who didn't lose her virginity until she was 16.
St. Spreadmund's.
well, what do you know?
what? What is it?
this is the tower card.
what does that mean?
well, the tower card means that as long as we remain inert, nothing will change, no progress will be made, until we take action.
take action?
Yeah, take action.
no matter how that action might mean the end of everything we deem sacred.
if you could go back in time and talk to yourself as a kid...
would you do it? - Absolutely.
mostly to warn myself about my ex.
you?
I can't do it.
can't?
won't.
I mean, I wouldn't.
facing yourself that young means you can change anything you want in your life with just a few words.
all the painful memories, all the wrong turns...
having that power makes you question every choice you've ever made.
who wants to face that?
what is it?
nothin'.
you're not like any of the thugs in my brother's employ.
you don't kiss like one either.
you kissed many of them, have you?
you really shouldn't let my brother Jimmy know you have brains to go with those good looks.
has he, uh, mentioned anything about...
well, has he mentioned anything?
about what?
about anything, you know, about, uh, me, about what his intentions are.
we don't talk about his business.
I try not to talk about mine.
you've got to be the stupidest idiot ever to walk upright, you know that?
Hey, big Patrick.
Oh, little Patrick, too.
Where's medium-size Patrick?
he have the day off?
Oh, look who it is.
you got anything you wanna tell me?
I got nothin' to say to you you don't already know.
you scuttle my sister.
I take you under my wing, my new prot?
if it was a Patrick or Sean, they'd be meeting my favorite cleaver, I swear to god.
but you...
you got style.
you got something dark in your soul, and I like that.
you could only really work for me.
come have a drink.
here.
have another drink, ah?
let's have a shot or two to welcome you into our little enclave, okay?
Slinte.
wanna see somethin'?
the picture there, with the dog - that's my old man.
nasty S. O.B.
he had these shoes that, uh, when he walked, made this horrible sound.
kinda hard to explain, but like a click-clack-clack, click-click.
you always knew he was comin' down the hall.
the typical Irish sad story.
old man comes home drunk, beats the crap out of me, beats the crap out of Colleen.
he was a rough S. O.B.
all around.
mine, too.
well...
so what did you?
I went down to the docks where he was workin', and he sees me, sees me walkin' up, and he says,"what do you- what do you want, boy?
and I say,"pa, smile."
and I take a tire iron, and I crack his skull two times.
you killed him?
Oh, god, no.
that's my father.
but he's layin' there, and blood's all over his face.
and he looks up, and he says to me,"about time, boy."
about time.
then I'm walkin' away...
and I hear that same sound, the cck-click-clack thing.
and he's still on the ground.
the sound's coming from my own shoes.
cause eventually, we all become our fathers.
there's no getting around it.
I believe we can change who we are.
no way, no change.
we're spurned from their loins.
so whether we like it or not, we wind up just like 'em.
let's have a drink to you...
saving your sister.
I love Colleen.
I love Colleen so much that I can't even put it into words.
I love her more than I love my own heart, which is why it hurts me to my...
Jimmy, come on. Now it wasn't like that.
you know, me and her - we're not...
I'm not talking about you and she and your fornications, okay?
it's got nothing to do with that.
Colleen talked to the cops.
my own sister.
how do you know that?
come on, man. This is crazy.
you don't have to do this.
no, I don't, do I?
you do.
what?
we're talkin' about your future now.
you do the honors.
take the gun.
you're family now.
take the gun!
she ain't worth it.
there you go.
I can't do it.
Sistercide-that's a cross I refuse to bear, and I ain't goin' to hell.
it doesn't have to be like this.
wh, some passionate chumminess, and all of a sudden you're telling me how it's gonna be?
pray tell, what do you say, sister sweet?
Jimmy, I'm no rat!
please, you gotta believe me!
Shh. You're a rat.
my own sister, a rat.
what are you standing over there like a delicate flower for?
shoot her! Come on!
yodel yo yo!
shut up, Petey!
she ain't talkin' to no cops.
I got a gut feeling about it, and my gut feeling's not wrong.
when I tell you to shoot her, you shoot her!
I can guarantee she's not talking to any cops.
guarantee? You can't guarantee anything!
how? - because I am a cop!
come again?
he said he's a cop.
I heard what he said, okay?
it's a rhetorical question, okay?
shut up, moron. You're a pig.
yodel yo yo yo!
Yeah.
I got a badge number an everything--2-4-6.
Jimmy Mcmanus, we want you for murder, extortion, racketeering, armed robbery and for just being a plain, old nasty bastard.
against the wall!
everybody, up against the wall!
move!
against the wall! Let's move! Now!
let's go!
this isn't loaded, is it?
that was great.
damn it!
come on now.
nice job, sis.
nice job. - Thank you.
God bless you. Very nice.
good. You're great.
now it's your turn to get on your knees.
get on your knees.
I'm not gonna tell you again.
get on your knees!
send this rodent to the rain.
you meet any saints along the way, put a good word in for me, please, okay?
we could've been friends.
Where's the car? - It's out back, Jimmy.
I don't need to see this.
you know, there's two kinds of guys that roam the kitchen.
there's crooks, and there's cops.
and as I said before, you don't kiss like no crook.
why couldn't you be real?
police! Get your hands up!
hands up!
McManus went out the back! He went out the back!
Freeze! Drop the gun!
got him! - Get her out of here.
move it.
let's go.
pretty good timing, boss.
the nose knows, huh?
the nose has an inside guy to watch your sorry ass.
"yodel yo" means everything's jake.
"yodel yo yo" means marshall the troops.
"yodel yo yo yo" means get your angry asses in here.
sergeant Pete Cochran.
been under since you been under, except all he needs is whiskey and a wire.
okay.
I-I don't know whether to be flattered or insulted, boss.
I'd go for both.
I trust you enough to worry about you, but I worry about you enough not to trust you.
good work. - Yeah.
McManus is in the wind, loot.
word on the spit is that your brother turned tail and is headed to Celtic town.
what do you know about that?
I don't know nothin'.
you know, thing about a girl like you?
I see you walking down the street, and I may say,
Wow. That's one sexy chick.
but knowing what you're really like...
on the inside...
you're uglier than a photo of a bulldog's hole.
Hey, Bono?
you know, I wonder, do your pals here - do they know who you really are?
they know you have a dark side
how you beat big Patrick to a pulp...
how you lie and pretend to be someone you're not?
shut up.
he's closer to my brother than he is to you.
I said shut up!
I don't know, sugar lips.
he's pretty damn close to me right now.
wallet.
there's a message from Rose Tyler to a commander...
skywalker?
uh, she hopes you'll decide to change your mind.
Oh, yeah.
she's, um...
wants me to speak to her son.
Yeah.
the woman you believe to be your...
your mother...
wants you to talk to yourself?
Yeah, she wants me to speak to...
me.
but I figured if I put it like that, you'd give me one of your epic looks of pity.
why does she want you to talk to you?
apparently, I've...
well, he's...
okay, we've been having trouble ever since my...ever since Vic left.
are you gonna do it?
I don't think so.
what if by me talking to me,
I say the wrong thing, and that wrong thing brings about some kind of tragic result...
some kind of bad ending?
I mean, this is all...
I mean, it's pretty - it's pretty fragile, Annie.
what if the simple act of talking to my younger self brings about...
darkness?
you're trying to remember where you put the phone number of the men from the funny farm right now, aren't you?
it's in my other coat.
you do have to ask yourself, if you don't talk to him, who will?
glad you changed your mind, detective.
Yeah, well, I didn't want just anyone talking to him.
Sam, he's heartbroken about Colleen.
eh, he'll get over it.
sometimes a faasy is better than the reality.
Yeah.
Sammy, I have somebody who wants to talk to you.
he's a policeman.
come on out now.
no.
you know what? Just give us a minute.
I did the same thing when I was his age.
okay.
she's gone. You can come out now.
my name is detective skywalker.
you can call me Luke.
your mom tells me you got into a fight last week.
and the kid you fought with- Jerry Flood
he made fun of you in front of your friends.
so you...
threw a rock at him.
I bet your mom said you were a bad boy, huh?
cause, you know, when I was growing up, my mom said I was a bad boy, too, sometimes.
I guess she was always scared
I'd turn out like my father.
was your father bad, Luke?
my father...
went over to the dark side.
but I know there was still good in him.
and I know that you threw that rock because you're upset that your dad is away on a long business trip.
and now your babysitter Colleen is in...
well, she's...
okay, she's moved to Florida.
but there'll be other babysitters, especially Jenny.
I mean, wow.
Jenny is like...
when you're 10, you're gonna love Jenny.
they're not coming back, are they?
I wouldn't count on it.
people just go away, you know?
it's not your fault.
it's not my fault?
it's not.
it's just life.
life?
life.
this guys' zooted. Hit him with the lights.
people come in and out of our lives, and they help shape who we are.
and we really hope that the good ones stick around.
somebody's having an alkie-holiday.
top of the mornin' to you, lads.
sometimes people go away.
sometimes they just away.
babylon, 331BC 50 miles south of Baghdad 2339 years later
get down!
get down!
this sucks, man.
get down!
get down! Get down!
luck of the Devil himself.
try and think, Mum.
did anyone come here and ask you for your notebook?
cos if they didn't ask you, they stole it.
has, em...
has anyone been here asking about my mother's belongings?
or asking about me?
not that I know of, but your mother...
she wouldn't know even if they had, yeah.
I'm afraid not.
haven't you sold that thing yet?
Hey, babe.
you said we were going to France.
the Riviera.
you owe me, Jimmy.
Yeah,Well ,If i'm right about this thing,I'll buy you a house on the Riviera. How about that?
Oooh, I like that.
does it come with matching earrings?
get your paws off!
do you hear that? -What?
it sounded like gas escaping?
don't do that.
tooth picks.
4, 000 years ago the Egyptians were building cities of gold, the Greeks temples of marble.
what were we doing?
we were picking our teeth.
what about Stonehenge? -Stonehenge?
well, it's pretty impressive, isn't it?
a bit?
the Pantheon is impressive.
the pyramids at Giza, the Nabatean temples carved into the rock at Petra, they're impressive.
you want to compare these wonders to a rockery off the A303?!
here end of the lesson.
come on, let's get back to work.
come on, she tends to bite hardest on those she's most fond of.
then she must really love me.
I'm sorry. I'm trying, but it's not happening, Viv.
you don't give good "victim."
so, any more mysterious phone calls from anonymous men asking if I've received "packages"?
what did he sent you?
my mother's old notebook.
Really? Can I see it?
no.
and you're absolutely sure that you know nothing about the person who called?
No,Nothing, I swear.
OK, OK. You're not on trial.
you'll want to see this.
cultural delegation from Iraq.
doing the Grand Tour of our dismal wee island.
they're visiting the private Babylonian collection in Bath.
look at them.
government's latest poster campaign for the glorious new future.
doctors, Philosophers, Film directors, even a Child chess genius.
And?
and a doctor of archaeology turned peacemaking politician.
Oh, it's wonderful to back here, yes, I've been here a number of times.
no we hope to be able to place everything up.
Dr. Hammadi?
Rachel Highgrove, coordinating the visit from this end,You're late.
were you lost? -Only in thought.
Ah, very poetic ,but we must keep the delegation to the itinerary.
Dr.Hammadi!
Dr.Hammadi!
Allah uh Akbar.
can I tempt you to recite the talk you gave in Cairo on the Ishtar Gate?
it would coincide with the relaunch of my old DVD.
Oh, you may remember, when this arch was first installed here?
in which you describe Babylon as Alexander the Great's bisexual stop-off point.
well, one must have an angle, as the conqueror said to the catamite.
Kahmil! Behold the chess champion.
I feel a photo opportunity coming on. Would you come over here?
gather round please.
excuse me, mate，Ali!
no need for panic, everybody.
no need for panic, everybody, a slight fracas that's all.
she's a war orphan.
our Government had him assigned to protect her.
tell him we could do without the cultural histrionics.
I have to take this.
Beautiful。
so much history.
catalogue it.
archaeology - one part scrabbling around in the filth to ten parts book-keeping.
are we having fun yet?
we saw the saints coming back in the sun and dust.
Gregory. -You haven't aged a bit.
I bathe in asses milk.
and this is new intern, Viv Davis.
nice to meet you.
we were all students together.
Oh, well, 15 years ago? -A pleasure.
Kahmil needs our help.
here is one of many sad sights from modern Iraq。
a Hellenistic temple destroyed by mortar fire.
2, 000 years and now it's gone.
the bombs blow open the ground and bring new treasures to the surface, from when Iraq was Babylon and a wonder of the ancient world.
Yes，we were great once.
and of course the Baghdad Institute of Antiquities has an insidious enemy。
Night-? -Looters.
smuggling finds out of the country for private collectors.
excited by their American buster-browns!
now we've traced one of the nighthawkers back here.
we don't know his name.
what does he have to sell?
Oh, wow, a brick.
perhaps from the Hanging Gardens.
it's inscribed by the king who commissioned the building.
built by Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon.
Aw, come on. The Gardens are a myth.
he needs our help.
can I have a word with you, please?
excuse us.
Kahmil is loaded.
with his family connections he can sort out his own problems.
and if he's now this big peace-making politician why's he worrying about some brick?
if you ask me, he's got an ulterior motive.
well, maybe he just wanted to look up some old friends.
Oh, yeah I bet he was gagging to see me and Dolly.
Oh, come on, you used to value hooky gear.
you could look up a few old contacts.
Hey, I was a student.
I was broke, That was another time.
comes in here in his '90s suit and his gelled hair,He has gel!
you're jealous?
you and I split up, right, that's one thing.
my decision, given.
you were devastated, sorry!
but within six days... Six days and you are doing the fandango with him!
I was a kid, you'd dumped me, and he told me how well he could dance the fandango.
Oh, this is great A brick.
from the legendary Hanging Gardens of Babylon and you turn it into an episode of Hollyoaks!
so this is an academic decision?
Yes. -No.
the academic decision would be to focus on the dig we're being paid for.
neolithic toothpicks aren't glamorous but they pay the rent.
he doesn't!
this is fun.
check out the inscription.
Yes.
very good fun.
give you 200 for it, no more.
Ah! That's better... Babylonian.
4th century BC.
Tiamat, goddess of evil.
what a lovely bitch she is.
I could move this on to a German collector I know.
no questions asked. 15, 000.
I'm not done yet, Max.
I've never seen anything quite...
it's nice but my clients tend to prefer a little more, ahem, "bling."
job lot, 20K.
I'll give you the necklace and the brick, Max, but not this.
not at that price.
it's only a bit of old carved stone, Jimmy!
this is an ancient cuneiform script.
if you can't find the cash, I'll find another buyer.
so now you're reinvented in the world of politics, what are you trying to achieve back home?
later this week I will sit down in private with fundraisers for the Sunnis and Shiites.
I will be asking them to redirect their war-chests into unifying Iraq.
we must put an end to sectarian violence if we are to be a great nation again.
Yeah, well,good luck with that.
did you order food in?
cos it might take a while.
how long has Vivienne been working with you?
it's a temporary thing.
we don't really have the funds to keep an intern.
Oh, look, I've got it, I've got it.
dr .Colloway!
middle-eastern specialist.
Oh, but he only does Saracen stuff, first and second Crusades.
no, before he lost his college post he was writing a book on the sacking of Babylon by Alexander the Great.
well, thanks for everything.
what if you get caught in a compromising position?
such as?
such as beating the crap out of an antiquities thief.
is that likely?
you were always pretty quick with your fists.
we were kids, Ben.
the position I caught you and her in was distinctly adult.
well, then you shouldn't have let her go, should you?
Oi! What's wrong with you, girly?
me? Nothing.
well, do what you're best at and put the kettle on!
when they said archaeology was a science, I didn't know they meant domestic science.
that's it, this baby's going on the website, if Max won't pay, somebody will.
this Max Garris had better check out, Dr Colloway.
thanks for coming along.
you sure Scotland Yard have an Ancient Antiquities Division?
I'll bet they do.
anyway, it did the trick.
Max Garris, do you know him?
it doesn't ring any bells.
hopefully I can find an address from this name.
can I ask you something.
if you're organising your own little peace conference, then why are you wasting time chasing this brick?
one brick is how every city in the world begins.
Yeah, and many a mickle makes a muckle.
we get those Christmas crackers too.
we could find it for you.
in fact， I'd love to.
no, thank you again for everything, but I really must do this alone.
I'd love to, we could find it for you.
anyway it did the trick, Max Garris, do you know him?
I can find an address from this name.'
babylon, such a wealth of extraordinary history, and then Alexander ransacked it in 331 BC, uptight little bisexual.
of course he went on to rule just about everywhere.
including Babylon and its Hanging Gardens.
do you think Dr Hammadi was right?
about a brick from the Hanging Gardens?
well, my God, it would be a red letter day at Dolly Towers if it was true.
but I sense this isn't about some brick.
I sense he's after something else.
what, Gregory? -I don't know.
yet.
Amwar, it's your brother, I'm getting closer, I can feel it.
I have a name, Max Garris.
Gillian Magwilde is helping me.
where is she based out of again?
Wessex.
Yes. Right.
I feel bad keeping her in the dark.
first rule of business
keep everyone in the dark.
Yes, but this isn't business.
it's not even politics.
it's a matter of salvation.
you see that's when you start to worry me, little brother, when you start talking like a prophet.
did you get the messages that I sent you?
come back to New York.
but New York is not my home, Amwar.
I believe that Gillian thinks that I am looking for something more than a brick.
if the Tablet is half as important as you say it is, no-one can be trusted.
not even the wonderful Gillian Magwilde.
soon everyone will know what we have found.
Kahmil, even when we were kids you were the one with the wild stories.
you kept the family enthralled.
myths have their power but they can be used in many ways.
for now just see Gillian Magwilde in the same light, not to be trusted.
Kahmil comes from a prominent Baghdad family.
his brother is Iraq's answer to Rupert Murdoch.
media baron, lives in the States these days.
arab TV stations, websites, newspapers.
the Hammadis have incredible influence in both Sunni and Shiite worlds.
many think Kahmil should have a much higher place in the new Iraq.
think he's a lech?
did you see the way he was staring at me?
my dear, I beg to differ.
now, this is leching.
Gregory! Don't you dare!
no ,this.,What's this?
just some other stuff I found on Babylon.
apparently the latest evidence suggests there was a big meteorite crash in that region.
assyria.
four and a half thousand years ago.
is it important, then?
no, not to us.
but it might be to some.
Oooh, hive of activity I see.
Gilly. -Yes.
take this. -What is it?
I know this sort of development still matters to you.
you are still following the gleam, aren't you?
could meteoric iron have been used, to make...something else?
Hey-hey! Look at this!
is this yours Gregory?
Ah, indeed.
we were post-grads, uncovered a stockpile of Roman denari.
Oh, God，Hail, Caesar.
you were so thrilled.
I remember you hollering "Hail, Caesar!" at the top of your voice.
did he always take his shirt off?
can we just leave it?
Mrs Wilson, prepare to find your tabby swinging from his own entrails.
here, puss，Here, sweetie.
come to me, you little...
that's the way.
come to me,Come on.
a meteorite crashes in Assyria.
2, 000 years later, Alexander is in Assyria.
is it possible?
is this where it started?
is this where it was made?
Alexander's was the destiny of men.
in his sword and shield.
the stars gave him his weapon.
the stars.
the answer must lie in the stars!
or am I getting as mad as you, Mother?
gill, it's Kahmil, I need you to come to Max Garris's place now.
Oh, my God...
what happened?
he was like that when I got here.
what did this to him?
it's like he's been bitten by something.
look, I shouldn't have called you, it's not fair.
are you looking for the brick?
do you think it's still here?
no-one will know you were here.
what are you so desperate to find?
I have seen this before in Baghdad, Occultists.
if this was a robbery then why not take this?
it's solid gold!
look, it's not about the necklace and it's not about the damn brick!
I am here for something so important...
so important a man has died over it!
I'm not going to go away until you tell me what the bloody hell it is you're looking for!
do you see these?
Babylon had street lighting when your ancestors were still running around in bear-skins.
you know, we were the first people to irrigate our land.
to map the stars and name them.
we created the alphabet!
the days of your week are taken from our days.
we were the cradle of civilization!
and look at us now.
Ravaged,Burning, Dismayed.
what am I looking for?
I am looking for hope.
the hope of a nation to be great again.
and peace throughout the land?
ten out of ten for ambition.
no, English.
I need to do practice.
I like puzzles.
me too.
my mum used to set me puzzles to solve.
that's why I love history so much.
because it's a puzzle with lots of clues to find.
my mother is dead.
well, I'm very sorry about that.
I hear her voice.
I hear my mother's voice too.
I beat a Russian man at chess.
I made him cry.
result.
good night. - Good night, sweetheart.
good night, heavenly princess Khanna.
thank you, Gillian, but this is one puzzle you cannot solve.
I want to help you.
then leave.
before being with me gets you hurt.
Taxi!
the followers of Tiamat are here!
they killed a man!
fanatics. This is too dangerous.
Tiamat is a dark force with a long, dark history.
if these people really worship Tiamat they'll stop at nothing.
I will not be intimidated by superstition and occultists!
you don't have to be intimidated, they'll do all the work.
they'll kill!
your credibility as a political figure will seriously be undermined with these crackpots on your tail.
I can't stop now!
this is our country's future!
Kahmil, come home.
you're in New York.
well, I try to call it home.
I can't leave this to Gillian.
I know her...
she won't give up.
ms Highgrove represents the interests of the Iraqi delegation.
what is your association with Dr Kahmil Hammadi?
Hello, it's nice to meet you.
I'm Gillian Magwilde and you are in my lab.
Rachel Highgrove, Nice to meet you.
what is your association?
I was at university with him, er, we had sex.
twice. In 1992.
twice?!
once is never quite enough.
may I have a word in private?
twice?
Kahmil's an important man from an important family.
many people think his obsession with these ancient objects is just going to drag Iraq back into the medieval quagmire.
but what is it he's looking for?
I don't know.
or you won't say.
who killed Max Garris? Cultists?
maybe.
it's happened before in Baghdad.
you don't need to worry about Max Garris. It's a diplomacy issue.
our people can handle it.
look, I'm just trying to help Kahmil, he's a friend.
no, he was your friend twice in 1992.
we'll look after Dr Hammadi, you dig up your medieval buckets.
right. Yes, well ，I have a "bucket" waiting in the lab right now.
so I'd best get back to it.
Tiamat, the serpent who would enslave the world.
what is that?
do you know what, you used to be fun.
my god, it's beautiful.
Babylonian for certain.
Kahmil's after something else.
something much more important.
than this?
I think the contents of this box is what he's after, and that's why Garris was killed.
but he won't tell you what it is.
he doesn't want to draw attention.
they're interviewing the whole Iraqi delegation over Max Garris' death.
they're talking about cultists, says here that when Kahmil starts promoting Iraq's Babylonian inheritance, it draws out all these wackos who follow Tiamat.
Tiamat, that's like the...
that's like Babylonian devil-worshippers, innit?
I love it!
Tiamat!
Oops, I've set him off.
in Babylonian mythology there was Marduk, the god of goodness.
and the goddess of evil was Tiamat.
a giant serpent.
that's what this is.
and I would say Dr Hammadi is searching for something of great importance that has drawn out forces of darkness who are trying to stop him.
Babylonian legend says that the god Marduk took on human form and slayed the evil serpent God Tiamat and ruled over the Earth.
then Marduk dictated stone writings that told of his deeds, but also predicted the future.
how do we know? 《The Enuma Elish.》
ancient scriptures detailing the history of Babylonian gods.
it tells us of a tablet that has never been depicted.
the holy writings of a Babylonian god. Well?
sorry, I'm just trying to get my eyebrow to raise cynically.
no, no, Gilly, this is what our boy is after.
prophesies of a god.
he always liked to think big.
and you know, where there are gods there are always devils.
I'm sure we can come to some agreement, Jimmy, but the price has dropped, 'it's three, not five...'
three? Three.
Jesus Christ, man, I just came down to five.
it's all we can do, Jimmy, I'm sorry.
call me if you change your friggin' mind!
our looter found the Tablet Of Destinies?
the Tablet was hidden after Alexander entered Babylon.
it was supposed to have predicted many troubles.
the closest comparison I can make is that the Tablet Of Destinies is a Babylonian Ten Commandments.
this would be the greatest Babylonian artefact of all time.
no wonder Kahmil lied to us, he's after glory.
don't be so ridiculous!
if anything, he was trying to protect us.
from the cultists? -Or from himself.
you have to go.
not until we find the Tablet Of Destinies.
Kahmil, this is amazing.
it was put on the web anonymously.
he put these pictures up to attract buyers, I'm sure of it.
now, I have analysed every Cuneiform symbol I can see.
this thing talks of the rise of a tyrant from Tikrit.
saddam! It talks about the invasion from the West.
the Gulf War.，It gives dates, it's.
it's incredible, Gilly!
you can't really believe this is a genuine prophecy?
a person is supposed to rise at this time, our time, called "The Gate."
he will reunite the country.
I believe the other side of the tablet reveals who the gate is.
is this why you've been hosting peace talks?
that you will reunite Iraq?
do you get to wear a cape and a mask?
it's about hope.
our country has been raped and beaten into submission.
by Saddam,By the West,By insurgents.
this tells us who we were and who we can be again.
Kahmil, this is arcane stuff.
you want a modern Iraq. -I want a proud lraq.
my brother controls the media.
we have connections to both Sunnis and Shiites.
maybe, just maybe, people will believe these writings and that things can get better.
you'll get a nation of Muslims to follow the god Marduk?
Marduk? Yahweh? Allah?
there are so many different names but it all boils down to one God.
one hope, one chance, a unified Iraq.
Alexander's army was exhausted.
suffering from heat-stroke and the injuries of battle.
but this beautiful young god inspired them to march double-time across the desert, following him.
I don't believe it.
shout, "Damn that woman!" Expunge the bile!
she's not answering her phone.
go on, expunge!
I'd let her get on with it，She reckons she's so right all the time.
both of you ，Damn that woman!
if she's with him, then her life is at risk.
these photographs we found at Max Garris.
it makes sense that coming from Iraq they were taken by a photo-journalist.
Yeah.
these digital frame stock numbers, well, they'd be registered.
Reuters?
reuters, on their website.
if we can find a match then we'll get the name of the person who still has the Tablet.
here we go.
look.
Jimmy Paul, freelance photographer.
that's it, we have to stop the tablet getting .
what was that?
we've got a clear path to the door.
no, we'd be dead before we reached halfway.
get back inside, there's a killer snake on the loose!
I see you're in a hotel room with him.
not now!
no sudden moves.
so what do we do, stand here till it dies of boredom?
rudyard Kipling's gardener did it with a rake.
why don't you just kill it?
I'm a nature-lover.
we found out who's got the Tablet of Destinies.
right then, let's go.
Cleve Farm.
this is the contact address on the website.
look at this!
no!!
hang on a second, why have an all-singing, all-dancing electric oven installed and then boil a kettle on a butane stove?
Oh, my god, it's real.
please, please! Can I?
this section here was not on the photographs.
we must decipher it.
OK, now what happens is you give it back to me.
it was never yours.
look, mate, you stole it first, we steal it second.
call it quits, you can keep the box.
sorry, "mate."
what the.
quick!
come on, baby.
look! What the hell's he doing here?
he works for our Government.
he's been following me since I got here.
did you check his bag for snakes?
ali could be working for the cultists.
what, and he's in charge of the little girl?
little girl?
what little girl?
Kahmil， OK.，Let's go.
there's a little girl now?
Where's Ali? What's happening?
we need to get you somewhere safe, sweetheart.
ali is protecting me!
he keeps me safe!
we'll take her back to the university.
but Ali's my friend!
he said not to trust anyone!
least of all Ali.
when I meet Tiamat, I'll give her your best...
sir, it's me，Do you have it?
no, they're heading back to the city.
this is all so damn surreal...
look, I think you should just tell him, sir, before he winds up dead.
this doesn't make sense.
part of the inscription isn't in cuneiform.
is this thing really supposed to bring peace?
if it inspires my countrymen as it has inspired me, then yes.
it's brought precious little peace so far, hasn't it?
can we just get back to the lab?
look at it!
it's not every day you get to look upon writings dictated by a god.
right, let's clean it using low grade acid and then take a scan for a 3D model.
it gives a time when the gate will be revealed to the people...
talks of them walking through the gate with their new future.
but this side of the tablet I can't make out, it looks like some kind of code.
we should call the police.
we are in way over our heads.
but that would just undermine Kahmil further.
you don't really believe Iraq's answers lie here, do you?
his belief in this Babylonian prophecy is never going to be taken seriously, in Iraq or in the West.
you like him?
he talks about my country, but really he's talking about himself.
and these markings are so rare, they have yet to be deciphered...'
it's the same.
what's the same?
those squares on the statue.
they are like...that.
so the decipher mechanism for this code is etched into the base of a palace gate.
maybe it was hidden on all the royal gates.
now we have a problem, gaining access to these markings.
that's the main atrium of the museum. Not a problem.
the markings are partially clogged with stone fragments.
we'll need to clean that with low-grade acid or masonry bits.
Plus, we don't know how the cipher works.
I can do it.
maybe you can.
OK, so assuming no-one's brought their Invisibility Cloak with them, how are we supposed to excavate in a public museum without anyone noticing?
.Professor Mastiff is an acclaimed expert on Babylonian culture.
his DVD film on the fall of the city to Alexander has been re-released and I...I suddenly thought this was a good time to highlight not only his documentary, but also my personal mission to see greater cultural understanding between our two nations.
of course, all this is just a bit of fun.
the DVD points to a greater cooperation between the Baghdad Institute and British academics who wish to bring its treasures to a wider public.
and it's still at the special offer price of ?? 6. 99.
and to celebrate Anglo-Iraqi relations, the mayor will be holding a civic reception here tonight, before the delegation leave tomorrow.
are there any questions? -Arsenal.
I'm here in case the press want a little tour of the relics.
if they do come through, would you be across the security in a supervisory capacity?
I can spot a military man.
excellent.
??
for Kahmil? Iraq?
ourselves?
why go after toothpicks and medieval pots when you can go after prophecies written by ancient gods, eh?
??
now let's get out of here before Mastiff rides through those doors on his sodding chariot.
so, these are the missing symbols from the arch in the museum.
wow, well, it all joins up.
but what does it mean?
it's a puzzle. I am good at puzzles.
it's easy!
Oh my God.
arrows.
but what are the arrows pointing to?
no, they're only there to line up the code.
this is the cryptic code found on the tablet, and this, the section found on the stone arch in the museum.
when they have their new position, the words are in a new order, revealing a new text.
we've cracked it.
these are the words highlighted.
no, this is all wrong, we have to start again.
Viv, I need the toilet. -Sure.
I'll take you.
you bastard! She's just a baby!
Five，Four.，Three.
do you want to go to a party with Aunt Rachel?
Kahmil, whose identity is on that thing?
we need to go. Khanna and I.
we need to go right now.
no, no, no, not until you tell...
he's taken her!
we might still catch them.
where is she?
it wasn't him!
it was a white guy took Khanna!
the one that came with Rachel Highgrove.
ask him why he was at the caravan.
I protect Khanna!
I protect everyone!
you dangerous, that's why I followed you!
he didn't want your search to endanger the delegation.
that's why he's been tailing you.
you are dangerous to us.
don't be crazy.
no, no, he's right.
you pulled us into this based on your arrogant obsession.
don't take your eyes off him.
we're going to gatecrash Ms Highgrove's party at the museum.
you don't know what's at stake.
Kahmil, it's OK.
you don't know what I know.
the gate is Khanna.
now, I am leaving here alone, with the Tablet. I know what I have to do.
it's Dr Hammadi, I'm outside.'
I'll be right out.
I knew you'd understand what needs to be done.
may I, please, Doctor?
she's fine.
but if you don't hand over that wretched thing, who knows?
now what happens is you join the party and you tell everybody that you got caught up in a wild goose chase for a silly mythical artefact.
you realise in so doing you have belittled the contemporary political purpose of this visit.
who are you working for?
shall we?
please tell me that's not his phone.
he dropped it， I picked it up.
there's a message on here from his brother.
so what?
what?
it needs a security code word.
you should have known better, Gilly.
Kahmil was always arrogant, could always twist you round his little finger.
people change.
sometimes not that much.
pack that in, you little bitch!
now, we are gonna wait upstairs, well out of the way.
and if you're good, we'll play cards.
do you like cards?
we're going to break the news to Kahmil and get the tablet back.
hang on.
no.
surely she would never be that...
.stupid.
turns out she is.
Dr.Hammadi has been involved in the hunt for a spurious stolen artefact.
his actions have, as they have in the past, done nothing except provoke violence.
rather than inspire, Dr Hammadi has undermined Iraq and reminded us all that it can still be a country living in the Dark Ages.
doctor, would you make your statement now?
Dr. Hammadi's a crackpot obsessed with ancient curses and magic prophesies.
heavy stuff there, Rachel.
be warned, Doctor, you're on thin ice.
I live on thin ice, love.
I listened to your brother, Kahmil.
he likes to speak to you from on high, doesn't he?
I have painful news for you, my brother,
I did everything in my power to stop you from your quest.
you paid no heed to my warnings or to the occultist 'attacks that Rachel Highgrove stage-managed to frighten you away.
we have to talk, Kahmil, before any more die.
I have powerful reasons why it is best for the tablet to remain buried.
he set up these ritualistic attacks.
to so totally undermine you that your Sunni-Shia peace conference would be ruined.
he doesn't want a strong Iraq at all.
he doesn't want his Western interests disrupted.
he doesn't want his people to have hope.
it's bad for business.
WESTERN business.
the business he's invested in.
he set it all up, didn't he?
belittling your validity and the importance of the tablet.
the tablet was going to be your guiding light at the peace table.
you know, he's not the first to be scared.
there are records that show that Alexander's men found the Tablet of Destinies, but Alexander knew that it offered the Babylonians hope.
and the people with hope can rise up.
he didn't want his rule threatened, so he had the tablet taken back to its hiding place.
do you think your brother and his friends in the States really want everything to change?
Dr.Hammadi has brought this...this shame upon himself.
and he will be making a formal statement...to that effect.
my own brother would see me shamed and ruined, all to keep Iraq lowly and to preserve his business interests?!
whatever is written on this thing, it will either happen or it won't.
my little brother went in search of hope and found you.
a shame for both of you.
let's get it in the car.
ms Highgrove wants her...
we need to get her out of here!
wait!
wait.
bring me back Khanna or I will be forced to shoot you.
I'm sorry. -No!
why do people not want us to have hope?
Amwar? You're here!
Amwar, what are you doing?
stop, stop!
Oh, God, let her go.
please! Don't.
why, Amwar? Why?
not superstition.
not more beliefs.
they? Aren't you an Iraqi too?
you plan to do what Alexander did?
extinguish a nation's hope?
it can't be done.
one gate will close and another will open.
I mean, you are greedy, Mr Hammadi, and supremely manipulative and unimaginably selfish.
but you're not a child-killer.
are you so intent on going to hell?
hell?
Ah, Gillian!
I think we have a claim to hold onto the Tablet for a few months.
will you back me up?
no, but thanks for thinking of me.
we are going to tell all sides that there was once a prophecy about our country.
and it had a happy ending.
do you think a little girl really can help a whole country?
it's a puzzle. I am good at puzzles.
are you ok?
I'm sorry I stared when we first met but it was obvious to me.
I know， And you do too, don't you?
go well.
you too.
look, mate, you're loaded.
you could live anywhere in the world.
but you choose to live there.
and you choose to work with Gillian Magwilde.
which one of us is the bravest?
Bye, then.
that bumf about the meteorite in Assyria.
any help to you?
Yeah, maybe.
it may be the breakthrough your mother never had.
Oh, Dolly, why would I follow my mum's obsessions?
it was all madness, wasn't it?
of course.
come on, keys, come to Gilly.
very funny, Dolly.
I would love to talk to you.
by the way, I'm next door.
Hello?
Dolly, is that you?
because it's been a long day and I'm not in the bloody mood.
I should warn you, I've got an Etruscan spear in my hand and I'm not afraid to use it.
look at this.
first World War, Mark One.
I think it's been buried.
clear the area!
run, run!
Oh ,my God.
No! Marmite.
they're Germans, doesn't have to make sense.
the man on the right...
is that body there.
this isn't just a war grave, It's a war crime.
we've all got them.
these men were obsessed with Joan of Arc.
dr Magwilde, I need to have access.
hell of a thing, being around you.
I'm a hell of a ride.
Casey, don't mess with my camera.
come on, Buzzy.
you're supposed to be Mr. Holiday Spirit.
mom said she wanted pictures of you, too.
well, use your cellphone, then.
an entrance fee of $20 per adult?
merry Christmas, suckers.
Oh, the North Pole Village is such a racket.
a racket? What do you mean?
in case you haven't noticed, everything here has a price tag on it.
why we still come here every Christmas, I do not know.
look, Santa's coming in on a zip line this year, from all the way up there.
how about that?
Oh, I miss the float.
it was old-fashioned, but at least it was charming.
why do you like this Santa so much?
it's ridiculous.
ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, we are minutes from Santa's arrival.
so let's gather by the workshop for a holiday surprise.
as we usher in a new season of joy, let's put our mittens together and give a warm, jolly welcome to the man of the hour, as he flies in directly from the North Pole.
...6...5... Okay, Casey, smile.
...4...3...2...1! No! Oh, God! No!
here, take this.
Casey, stay here.
don't worry, boys and girls.
what's wrong?
Oh, God!
thank you, Buzz, for bringing me up to speed.
nice to meet you, Casey.
don't let this ruin your visit.
thank you, Chief Johnson.
how do we know this wasn't an accident?
l. A. city fire department inspected the zip line that our victim was using, and it appears that someone tampered with the brakes.
this trolley Santa was riding uses two pads to create the friction necessary for stopping.
one of these pads was pried loose.
it also has a battery-powered back-up system, but no battery.
and the entire kit is rented from a company called "Zip Xperience."
the owner says they ran trials yesterday afternoon, and both brakes were working properly.
so, according to the elves
I've been waiting to say that my entire life
according to the elves, our dead Santa's name was Randy Mann.
DMV has him residing in Humboldt.
and our young St. Nick has a sheet
two prior arrests for cultivating and distributing marijuana.
Oh, over there, the crying elf
that's his wife, Lisa.
I count two crying elves.
well, the other one's Carmen.
seems, uh, Santa played the field a little.
Hey, he's not the real Santa.
you sure about that, Buzz?
what my brother means is, the guy who really runs this little con job of a Christmas village is Santa Jack.
after the accident, I saw him run back into his workshop.
okay. Thank you, Casey.
I'll be back in a minute.
so [clears throat] Buzzy, why don't you introduce us to Casey?
Oh, he doesn't need to.
you are Detective Sanchez, the one who threatens people.
you are Lieutenant Tao, of course, oh, and that's your bag of tricks. Mm.
you are the very sharp-dressing Detective Gabriel.
hello. - Thank you.
judging by the cynical tone in your voice, you must be Andy Flynn.
Hi.
and that makes you the grumpy one, Lieutenant Provenza.
hello. - Grumpy?
well, when I'm being shot at, maybe.
but the rest of the time, I am just a cuddly Teddy bear.
lieutenant, Casey's afraid of bears.
Oh. Excuse us, please.
we don't want to interfere with your work.
Bye.
this is a disaster.
I understand that the zip line was a new feature and that you used to enter on a holiday float?
Yeah. That burned down to its gearbox.
no one knows how.
sorry about the smoke
usually not allowed in the workshop.
how did this happen?
poor Santa Randy.
I had the whole thing rigged up the right way.
I was supposed to go down, land on the platform, and go down the chimney myself.
but when I tried out the zip line yesterday, believe me, Santa screamed words that no children should ever hear.
and I take my job as role model very seriously.
eggnog?
no, thanks. I'm...on duty.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
sorry. I'm having a few very bad months here.
I run a Halloween fair, too
a haunted house, corn maze, pumpkin patch -- everything.
one boy got botulism -- one boy, and the county shut down my entire operation for a month.
and my sleigh gave out.
your sleigh?
Yeah, red minivan. I call it my sleigh.
cost over $1, 000 to fix.
and now Santa Randy is dead.
Oh, God. Oh, God.
were you and Randy close?
Santa Randy.
Yeah, great kid.
he's been selling trees here since he dropped out of college.
but, of course, he wanted more out of life.
so being a good guy, I-I sent him to Santa school last September, bought him the suit, paid for him to join the order.
I understand that Randy and his wife -- - Santa Randy.
...Santa -- Santa Randy and his wife, Lisa, were having problems.
well, yeah, after work, there may have been a few of what we refer to around here as, uh, "Reindeer Games.
pole dancing" -- that kind of thing.
and I understand Santa Randy was a little overly friendly with the elves this year.
Oh, Santa Randy.
but let me tell you -- Lisa had a very hard time adjusting to Randy's new station in life.
she had married a man -- whew!
and he had become part of a legend.
and I can tell you from personal experience, the role of Mrs. Claus is more than most women can handle.
sorry.
some ashes there.
my fault.
look, Santa, I need you to come downtown and give me a statement about this zip line.
well, there's absolutely no problem there.
excuse me. One second.
he would have wanted me to have it!
he was my husband, you slut!
he didn't love you anymore!
it's all legally mine! - It's not yours! Ladies!
girls ????
ladies, come on. All right, that
now, Gabriel, give them a sec.
one of them might say something incriminating.
elves! Elves!
please!
all right, I've had enough.
put 'em all under arrest!
all right, let's go. Let's go.
everybody, let's go.
Hey, you -- you come back here! You come
you -- you are a very strong elf.
okay. All right. All right. Okay.
okay. You -- hey!
Santa is not gonna like this.
this is a lot of Christmas cheer, Chief
drugs, cash.
add in the elf sex...
three very traditional motives for murder.
it's just so hard to believe that someone would use a Christmas village to sell drugs.
well, people use Christmas - Casey.
to sell everything.
and that's what Santa Jack was all about. - Casey.
we do not interrupt detectives when they're discussing a case.
chief, I'm -- I'm very sorry.
no, no, no, no. It's fine.
I think your sister might have a point.
with the amount of drugs we have here, we should be able to get a warrant for everyone who works at the North Pole's...
...Credit reports. - Mm-hmm.
and make sure that you include the victim's wife, uh, please.
let's see if anyone has more money in the bank than they ought to.
excuse me. - Okay.
we're supposed to be going to your attorney's office right now.
well, I don't know if you've heard, but someone murdered Santa Claus.
look, Pope pulled Raydor off your back with the understanding that you would focus, focus, focus on this federal lawsuit, which, first and foremost, means keeping appointments with your lawyer.
I took off work today to go with you.
I can't believe you're even thinking about being late, let alone not showing up at all.
what is wrong with you? - Hey, hey, hey.
you have the right to remain jolly.
now pull it together. We need to leave.
okay.
everyone, look, uh, I have to go.
but, uh, you know, Santa Jack should have been here by now.
let's find out where he's gotten to.
and I-I need to know who else had access to that zip line between the last safety check and our accident, which is what we're going to be calling this until we can sort out who's been...
naughty and who's been nice.
thank you.
well, it's clear now, that Goldman only brought that Baylor suit against you in the hopes of establishing a leak in your division.
and he has used that leak to amass an impressive list of litigants for this federal lawsuit of his.
so, Brenda...
why don't we take a little walk down memory lane, which, for you, leads through a cemetery, okay?
okay.
in addition to Turell Baylor, whose death I now look back upon with a certain fond nostalgia, we have the very thuggy Nick Koslov, son of a Russian crime boss.
who confessed to stabbing teenage prostitutes to death.
he was murdered after you alerted his family's attorney that the young Mr. Koslov was also an informant for the FBI.
Yeah, that was not a good day.
and began a troublesome pattern you continued with Roger Stimple.
a child molester who confessed to murdering three little girls.
and hanged himself in jail after you "forgot
to put him in protective custody.
then there's Martin Vasquez, a Mexican federale whom you arrested under another name
coincidentally, the name of someone Vasquez had paid to have murdered in jail.
also, by complete coincidence,
Mr. Vasquez died within an hour of landing behind bars.
Vasquez was a corrupt cop responsible for dozens of homicides, working for the Garcia cartel.
and then, of course, we have Kyle, who shot himself in your interview room.
cause he couldn't kill me.
and lastly, but not leastly, Phillip Stroh.
what? Stroh?
he's not dead. Is he?
surprisingly, no, but your wife has been harassing him for over two years.
and, in addition to badmouthing him to the authorities, chasing away his clients...
Brenda, what the hell? People he's defending have a right to know who they're dealing with. You have to be -- are you out of your mind?
in addition to all of that, every year on May 5th,
Mr. Stroh receives a mysterious bouquet of flowers from the deceased Jessica Goodall.
a little bit creepy.
I want Stroh never to forget what I know, and that is that he raped and murdered Jessica February 5th, 2008, the night before her 30th birthday.
if you know that, why didn't you arrest him and try him in court?
why are you being so mean?
I am not being mean.
I'm simply presenting a more mild version of Goldman's case, and if you respond to him the way you responded to me, the L. A.P. D. will have to institute costly new custodial procedures, and you and Fritz could end up forking over every penny you have in punitive damages.
that's all for today.
before I forget...
I have a gift for the two of you.
in the spirit of the season, enjoy.
but we didn't get you anything.
not to worry -- it's from the firm, actually.
not from me personally.
wait. Did you say punitive damages against us?
I'm afraid so, yes.
and to get all the bad news out of the way this afternoon, my retainer's gone.
so if you would like me to continue as your counsel,
I'll need another $25, 000 by the end of the week.
merry Christmas to you, Mr. Scrooge.
I thought he was my friend.
he's your friend, Brenda, but it's also what he does for a living.
Yeah, you mean making money off the troubles of innocent people?
what did he give us? What's in the box?
Oh, it's a silver tree ornament.
with the initials of their firm on it.
no, no, no, no.
don't throw it away. I want it.
in the spirit of the season.
here's a little Santa schematic, Chief.
zip line was installed yesterday at 5: 30 p. m.
four successful dry runs.
zip Xperience signed off on their equipment at 8: 30 p. m.
Yeah, the safety agreement has three signatures on it
Jack McBride, otherwise known as "Santa Jack,
his niece, Donna, who Julio's bringing up right now, and our victim, Randy Mann.
security guards were on duty last night until this morning at 10: 00 a. m. when the doors opened, leaving the trolley and the cable unattended.
full system failure -- a few seconds after noon.
giving us two hours when nearly anyone could have disabled the zip line's brakes.
great. Okay.
any other motive possible besides drug dealing?
Ah, yes.
it seems that our victim, Santa Randy, and his wife, Lisa, were recently qualified for a business loan.
Lisa has admitted that they were planning to open their own Christmas village.
another North Pole in L. A?
is that really such a big deal?
well, believe it or not, Chief, Santa Jack's village generates lots of cash.
after paying his taxes, rent to his niece, and alimony to a couple of Mrs. Clauses, - Santa brings home over $200, 000 per year. - Chief.
I have Santa's niece Donna in interview room 1.
okay, great. Maybe she can tell us where her Uncle's hiding.
Hey, Casey.
come on.
we're needed in electronics.
come on.
detective Sanchez! With me now, please.
ms. McBride, I'm Deputy Chief Johnson.
I am so sorry about the tragedy today at your Christmas village.
Oh, it's not my village.
dad left the property to me, but the village itself is my Uncle's.
technically, I'm his landlord.
he's supposed to pay a percentage of his receipts to me, but, more often than not, I just let him forget it.
I see. So, if you're not involved, why did you sign off as a witness on the safety agreement for the zip line?
well, as land owner, I still need to be careful about liability.
so you have nothing to do with managing the North Pole?
Oh, no.
no, I-I couldn't work with the people that Jack hires.
Randy Mann, with an arrest record like his...
so you guys knew that Randy was a drug dealer?
Oh, yes. Uncle Jack had to go bail him out once.
Randy never paid him back, of course.
and yet he sent him to Santa school?
this is gonna sound odd, but Uncle Jack thinks that playing Santa gives people an opportunity to...
redeem themselves, that to embody the Christmas spirit made one a better person.
for him, Santa's a spiritual thing.
jingle bells jingle bells
everybody!
jingle all the way!
sorry I'm late.
I was home a-wassailing.
come on. Let's get some Christmas going here.
Oh, my God. Your Christmas tree
it's completely naked.
people, you need to deck these halls, pronto.
eyes straight ahead.
you can't see anything here.
Hey, that's Donna. Why is Donna on TV?
all right, come on. Let's go. - No, I know her.
great. You know her. - Why is she on television?
let's go. - Please, I'm capable of guiding myself.
steady. - Ohh.
stay. Ohh.
Hello, everyone.
my apologies for appearing before you in dis
in this unseemly condition.
Santa is never publicly drunk in uniform.
it's a violation of my oath.
but I had no time to change into Santa casual before your extremely rude friend here dragged me from my humble abode.
Hello, young lady.
Santa Claus at your service.
and who would you be?
what? You don't know me? - Oh!
but I sat on your lap every Christmas for years.
I'm Casey Watson.
Oh, and who would you like to do when you grow up?
Hey!
well, I'm actually already doing it.
I'm a meteorologist at a weather station in Seattle.
a weather girl!
so you'll tell us all about what's it's like in santas all over the world.
what it's like in santas?
Yes, you know -- is it hot in Santa Barbara?
Santa Ana? Santa Monica?
cause it's plenty hot in here, Casey!
all right.
Oh, that voice.
what is she yammering on about now?
...Their own business loan and were looking to open their own Christmas village somewhere?
well, good luck in finding the undeveloped land anywhere near us.
Randy was gonna compete with my Uncle? That's horrible.
I-I can't believe I got so upset when he crashed into that chimney.
this will break Jack's heart.
so Santa Randy was trying to open up his own village?
you think Santa didn't know what was going on behind his back?
Santa has powers Randy never even dreamed of.
you think I changed places with him on the zip line because I was frightened?
Santa does not know fear.
well, then, Santa, tell us, why didn't you do the jump yourself?
Yeah. Why'd you change the batting order, Santa?
Santa's secret insights
I know when people have been bad.
so I went to Randy.
I said, "why don't you do the zip line?
go down the old chimbly?
no, no, no. Santa, just wait a minute, okay?
I paid him an extra $500.
Santa Claus cannot be taken by surprise.
Randy expected to replace me?!
Well...Not...Anymore.
Santa! Santa? Santa?
buzz, you want to give us a hand?
hold on. Hold on.
Oh, my gosh.
put him on Buzz's desk -- Buzz's desk.
Oh, he reeks. Geez! - Watch his arm. Watch his arm.
what happened to Santa?
get him on the desk. He passed out.
get him on the table. Oh, my God.
what's the matter, Lieutenant?
I never mirandized him.
why not? - You're kidding me.
what does that mean?
what that means is, we apparently have a Santa-on-Santa crime, but we can't use anything our suspect here said to prove it.
well, I don't know about that, Lieutenant.
buzz, did you get his statement on film?
Yes, ma'am. Unfortunately, I did.
well, I'll take a look at it.
it could be helpful, depending...
depending on what?
depending on how much you believe in Santa Claus.
sorry.
why are you guys still here?
well, Santa gave us the gift of overtime.
we had to serve a search warrant at his workshop, his house, and various storerooms.
in addition to some of the cheesiest decorations you've ever seen, we found all of his business records.
I thought he admitted everything.
Yeah.
well, uh, you know, there were some problems with his statement.
what kind of problems?
for one thing, he confessed before we got a chance to read him his rights.
Really? - Why do people do that?
did we smash his head in?
Oh, no, no, no.
that's, uh, from too much egg-nogging.
he passed out drunk in electronics.
great. That's yet another reason everything he said could be ruled inadmissible.
Oh. And he also implied that he was the real Santa Claus.
now, so we asked Buzz to try and sober him up so he wouldn't blurt anything else out that was incriminating.
the Chief would like a proper crack at him.
you're welcome.
Oh, uh, thank you, young man.
would you happen to have a cigarette?
no, and this is a nonsmoking area.
even for Santa? - Especially for Santa.
you're meant to come down the chimney, not smoke like one.
well, then, would you pull a trash can over here, please?
you know, when I was a kid, I looked forward to talking to you for months.
you were the symbol of my very favorite time of the year.
and now I-I feel you've ruined every Christmas memory that I have.
Plus, you don't even recognize me.
that's not true.
I recall you very well
a very caring young boy with a happy smile.
why, I might even be the reason why you work with the police now.
one year, you sat on my knee, you looked Santa in the eye, and you asked... for a camera.
I never asked you for a camera.
Oh, well. Sometimes I get lucky.
God.
well, that should sober him up a little bit.
sorry. These things occasionally happen to Santa.
Really?
by the way, does he have a motive?
two, actually, sir.
not only was the victim about to compete with him, but, uh, Santa Jack has probably...
Santa Jack? - Yes, sir.
Santa Jack has probably the best business insurance policy I've ever seen in my life.
being that he has a seasonal operation, if he's shut down for any reason at all, he's guaranteed the previous year's income.
policy was hard to find, sir.
his financial papers were a mess.
about the only thing he did file properly...
...Were the letters and cards he got from kids over the years.
right.
So...Why are we all standing here?
Oh. Excuse me.
sorry. I need to get through.
please, allow me.
Hey. You can go through. - Thank you.
Yes, sirree.
who is that?
that is Buzz's sister Casey.
she does the weather in Seattle.
she's hot, sir.
but she has opinions.
Oh. - Oh, my.
Santa vomit -- how charming.
tell me, Buzzy, still believe this guy represents the magic of Christmas?
now, hold on a minute, young lady.
I'll admit that my behavior the last few hours has been disgraceful.
but I want you to know that, before this evening,
I spent my entire adult life respecting Christmas.
and in case you've forgotten -- where is she?
and in case you've forgotten,
I also stand for peace on earth and joy to the world.
behold -- even in my darkest hour, the power of Santa Claus draws these jaded police officers to gaze on me in wonder and awe.
they know what I represent is real.
they certainly look real.
maybe I should show them around.
I mean Buzz and his sister, while she's in town.
Yeah, right. - Oh.
you know, as chief of police, I can take her places nobody else can.
would y'all look at yourselves?
like a bunch of diabetics standing in front of a candy store.
did Santa wake up from his long winter's nap, so we can all get back to work?
really, guys, can we please?
we have important work to do here.
come on.
okay, Santa. Time to get up.
let's go.
Hi, Casey. Hi.
well, merry Christmas to both of you.
and thank you, young lady, for your healing attentions.
Oh. Oh, sorry.
probably lint from my beard. My fault.
let's go. Come on.
you have the right to remain silent.
all right.
if you give up that right, anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
I hate you bother you with this, but, um...
you have the right to an attorney. - Yes.
if you can't afford one, one will be appointed to you.
Gavin is asking for another $25, 000, and I don't have it.
he's still charging you? All right.
don't worry about it.
I'll fix it.
thank you, Will.
thank you so much.
okay, Chief.
Santa Jack, when we spoke earlier today, you said that you gave up your trip on the zip line because it frightened you.
and I keep thinking how lucky it is that the person who replaced you was the same guy trying to open his own Christmas village.
but he was also the only other qualified Santa at the North Pole.
and now that I'm sober, I really feel bad about that accident.
well, you know, it's funny that you use the word "accident..."
...'Cause we found evidence that suggests that someone tampered with the brakes on that zip line.
making it look less like an accident and more like a murder.
murder?! Ohh!
but...you can't think Santa did this!
earlier this evening, you implied
Oh, no, no, wait.
that -- that was the eggnog talking.
listen, if I wanted Randy dead, I wouldn't have offed him in front of a bunch of innocent little children.
this has ruined my business.
no, actually, it hasn't.
you're about to make out like a bandit.
what's that?
excuse me, sir. - Oh.
that's your business insurance policy.
thank you, Detective.
it covers all revenues losses from the closure of the North Pole Village.
you could actually make more money closed than if you'd stayed open.
hope I'm not crowding you, Casey. - Mm.
Casey, right? - Mm-hmm.
chief of Police William Pope.
Hi. - Nice to meet you.
my brother must have set this up for me as part of the lease agreement when he bought me the village.
keeping a close eye on this case. - Mm.
a lot of frantic parents calling in.
I'm hoping we can keep from spoiling Santa Claus for a lot of little children.
that's wonderful.
you're helping parents delay the moment children realize they've been lied to about Christmas their whole lives.
that must make you very proud.
listen, uh, do you happen to know how much, uh, how much, uh, Santa Jack gets paid for having to shut down like this?
this year, approximately $600, 000.
holy frankincense And myrrh!
Hey, does it also cover what happened to my float, too?
wait. What happened to your float?
Oh, it went up in flames.
Oh, burnt completely.
I-I barely got out of the storage garage alive.
you were with the float when it caught on fire?
well, yeah.
truth is, I-I get a lot of attention now, but the rest of the year,
I'm mostly just another out-of-work actor in Hollywood.
and sometimes when I'm feeling a little blue,
I-I dress up in my old Santa suit and go hang out in my float, maybe have a drink or two.
anyway, last September, I passed out on my sleigh bench, and when I woke up, the entire float was in flames.
Yeah, and my, uh... My best beard, the one made entirely of actual yak hair -- torched!
burned up faster than a pair of kid's pajamas.
Oh, my God.
the Halloween fair's even paid for, even though the health department shut me down.
because of botulism.
Yeah, in one single brownie, and it was brownie, to boot.
little guy snatched it right off the platter of snacks that Randy and I kept in my big Jack-o'-lantern.
that was my name at Halloween
Jack Lantern.
funny, right?
didn't something happen to your minivan, too?
Yeah.
my brakes went out just as I was getting off the freeway.
luckily, the light was green at the bottom of the exit ramp.
otherwise, Santa would have crashed and
so, wait. Wait. Wait.
today, the zip line. Yeah.
before that, the minivan.
and the brownie and the float.
my God!
is this part of the war on Christmas?
either that, or today someone killed the wrong Santa.
Fritzi? Hey.
you're up late.
Yeah. Yeah.
something about possibly losing everything we have made it hard to nod off, so I thought I'd get Christmas up and rolling.
how'd your day go?
good. Good. - Mm.
I'm sta-- oh, Keith!
I'm starting to think that somebody really doesn't want Santa at the North Pole.
and his niece was right.
we've been checking with realtors, and Randy and Lisa couldn't afford a vacant lot in Los Angeles, much less their own Christmas village.
Hey, Fritzi, what are you doing?
I am taking down all of your Phillip Stroh stuff.
what? Why? - I am. I am tired of looking at him.
it is creepy, having him in our guest room all the time. But the case is still open.
and I'm the only person who still remembers what happened to all these poor women. Hey, look, I live here, too.
and I've got to get this guy out of our guest room.
it's not good for me, so one of us has to go.
okay. Fine. I'll -- I'll take him to work.
that's not a big deal at all.
Hey, look, look, look.
I know what Stroh did was awful.
but holding on to the past like this, refusing to let go of the guy -- it's hurting us, too.
it's making this court case we're facing more credible.
don't you want to beat this thing?
is getting Stroh worth risking our whole future?
you're right. I'm sorry.
sorry. I know you're right.
sometimes, I hold on to things longer than I should.
but, look, you have to know that there's nothing on earth I want more than to get rid of Gavin and Goldman and this whole terrible lawsuit...
so that the future can go back to what it used to be.
I'd be happy if our guest room goes back to what it used to be.
look, the future is gonna be what it is.
in the meantime, try not to freak out in advance.
what?
how true.
freaking out in advance
that's -- that's just not right.
Casey, don't mess with my camera.
come on, Buzzy.
you're supposed to be Mr. Holiday Spirit.
mom said she wanted pictures of you, too.
okay, uh, let's fast-forward to the accident, please.
...6...5... Okay, Casey, smile.
...4...3...2...1! No! Oh, God! No!
okay, stop it right there.
L-let's go back to where the woman screams.
...4...3...2...1! No! Oh, my God! No!
freeze it. There.
you know, when Buzz first showed me this footage, it didn't quite register that the woman started screaming before Santa Randy took the leap.
and as you can see, Ms. McBride, that woman is...You.
Donna McBride, you have the right to remain silent.
anything you say can and will be used against you...
wait a minute. I don't understand what's happening.
why are you, uh...
your niece was horrified in advance of the accident.
which means, Santa Jack, that she knew Randy was about to take the death plunge that she had planned for you.
no. No, that's not right.
I-I could never kill my Uncle Jack.
you're probably right, but not for lack of trying.
and who else has access to his property, could burn down the place where he stores his float, or fiddle with his brakes?
but she doesn't know anything about zip lines.
well, she knew everything she needed to know after signing off on the safety agreement, including how the brakes work.
and she saw you rehearsing the ride.
this is nonsense.
why would I do such a terrible thing?
I remember you telling me that Randy and Lisa couldn't afford to buy the North Pole.
made me wonder just how much a plot of land like that would cost in L. A.
so we did some research.
two days before your Uncle's car accident, the real-estate company of Brown&Barrows offered you $20 million for the property that you're leasing to your Uncle for life.
and, lo and behold, two days later, his minivan crashes.
one week later, Brown&Barrows upped their offer by $1 million.
and your Uncle barely escaped burning to death on his float.
there's a pattern.
offer. Botulism.
offer. Zip line.
listen to me, Donna. This is what I'm going to do.
I'm going to arrest you for murder in the first degree and three counts of attempted santacide.
but in the spirit of the season, and since you weren't really trying to kill Santa Randy,
I'm not going to pursue the death-penalty trial if you just say the magic words.
I offered you a million dollars to give up that lease.
Christmas...is not for sale.
you idiot!
what? I am not an idiot.
you didn't to dress up in that stupid red suit and wave at people. It is not a stupid red suit!
you are not a legend!
there are hundreds of santas better than you!
you are the worst actor ever -- ever!
young lady, I'll have you know I've won six drama-logue awards!
Oh, God!
he is a degenerate undeserving blowhard who ruined every Christmas for me my entire life!
because of him, I never even got the chance to believe in Santa Claus!
Yeah, I wanted him dead.
and if I ever get the chance, I'll try and kill him again!
well, merry Christmas to you, too.
another $25, 000? Are you serious?
I know it's been a while since you worked in the city attorney's office, but do you recall what a public servant like Chief Johnson is paid?
I recall it very well.
that's why I left and got into private practice, where, lest we forget, people pay me for my services.
so far, I've saved the city over $500, 000.
and if I'm fending off a $50 million award, plus punitive damages against Chief Johnson, in what can only be described as the biggest lawsuit of its kind currently before the federal bench, my compensation should be relative to my expenses and my time involved.
all right, listen, if you are trying the biggest lawsuit of its kind currently before the federal bench, then you're gonna be on television a lot and
well, my public profile is part -- - I'm still talking.
I'm still talking.
all right, look, you could not buy the kind of publicity that you will get from this case.
from now on, you will be the first resort of any law-enforcement officer facing similar charges, and I'm guessing your rates will go up accordingly.
to be clear, if you are not willing to take this pro bono,
I guarantee you somebody else will be.
if want to set up your next competitor, be our guest.
well, let's not draw this out.
I don't usually work for free, but I like Brenda, and I hate Peter Goldman, and my office will be in touch.
Bye-bye.
Oh, will...
thank you so much for helping me again.
there's no way we could afford to pay for that.
excuse me.
I couldn't help but overhear
c-correct me if I'm wrong, but are you under the impression that Chief Pope was in any way responsible for procuring me my last retainer?
well, I know the city didn't volunteer to pay it.
you're right.
and Chief Pope had nothing to do with it, either.
he didn't? - No.
that money came from your husband, out of an inheritance he had from his parents.
I'm sorry. Where were we?
Ah, yes, I remember.
Bye-bye.
I know you thought he was a sham, but look at this.
here's all the stuff Santa Jack saved from kids over the years
thousands and thousands of letters filed alphabetically and by date.
one in particular stands out to me.
dear Santa...
I am writing you "because we have had a very hard time since we lost my dad.
and someone stole my big brother Buzzy's bicycle, "and mom says we can't buy a new one.
all of his friends have bikes, and he feels left out, "even though he acts like it's okay.
we still live in the same place we did last year.
and if there's anything left over after the bike, "I would like a pony.
I love you, Santa.
you see?
can anyone here say "hallelujah!" 20 million times really fast?
cause that's how grateful I am for the $20 million
Brown&Barrows has just agreed to pay me for my Christmas village!
I thought you said you'd never give up the North Pole.
well, that's before you guys proved that my niece tried to kill me.
now she needs a lawyer.
so I told her, if she signed the land over to me, I'd sell it and help her hire one.
here, here. Enjoy.
Oh. The reason for the season.
don't think I forgot about you, young fella.
if it wasn't for that trusty camera of yours,
Donna would be planning on murdering me again, I'm sure.
so, tell us, Santa, what are they gonna build at the North Pole?
what they always build in L. A.
a temperature-controlled indoor shopping environment, featuring lots of retail stores all crammed next to each other and connected by an escalator and a food court.
happy holidays!
I can't believe you sold Christmas.
Oh, nonsense, Buzz.
what says Christmas better than a mall?
my very words, ye merry gentlemen
my very words.
and Santa remembers you, too, lovely lady.
Oh. Sorry.
a little confetti there. My fault.
and don't forget, boys and girls, to tune in on Christmas Eve, when we will be plugging in our specially modified doppler 12000 radar to track Santa's progress as he makes his journey all the way from the North Pole and into your living room and under your tree.
I'm Casey Watson.
good weather, and good night.
and we're out.
I got nothing, sir. No sign of Niobe or Ghost.
should we try to contact them? -Won't matter. My gut says they're down.
we should start back. -lf that ship can fly, we need it.
I was afraid you'd say that.
search every pipe, every hole, every crack we know.
sweep as wide as possible, as fast as possible.
lines are crawling with calamari. -The sooner we find them the better.
thought you could use something to eat. -Thank you.
any change?
no.
how is he? -He's gonna be fine.
at least until he wakes up.
what do you mean? -Captain has some questions for him.
he'd better have some good answers.
you see these cuts? I think they're self-inflicted.
Why? -VDTs maybe. I don't know.
but like I said, the answer better be good.
Roland, I'd like to run another search through the Matrix.
for what? -For Neo.
how could he be in the Matrix, sir? He's not plugged in.
please, for me.
this is what keeps bothering me.
what?
his neural patterns don't read like someone who's in a coma.
the strange thing is, I see these patterns all the time.
where? -On someone jacked in.
the big bupkes. Nada. He's not in there.
sir, I got the projections. -How long?
based on point of entry and the past speed, the machines will be in Zion in 20 hours.
Jesus H. Christ.
all right, let's move with a purpose. AK, I want you on holographic.
mauser, I want forward and aft guns manned at all times.
and make sure we are running on as few pads as possible.
Hey! You got a call. -What?
operator.
it's Seraph.
I bring word from the Oracle. You must come at once.
good morning.
who are you? -My name is Sati. Your name is Neo.
my papa says you're not supposed to be here. He says you must be lost.
are you lost, Neo?
where am l? -This is the train station.
this isn't the Matrix? -That's where the train goes.
that's where we're going, but you cannot go with us.
why not? -He won't let you.
who won't? -The Trainman. I don't like him.
but my papa says we have to do what the Trainman says...
...or else he will leave us here forever and ever.
Morpheus, Trinity, thank you for coming.
one thing I've learned in all my years...
...is that nothing ever works out the way you want it to.
who are you? -I'm the Oracle.
I wish there was an easy way to get through this, but there ain't.
I'm sorry this had to happen.
I'm sorry I couldn't be sitting here like you remember me...
...but it wasn't meant to be. -What happened?
I made a choice, and that choice cost me more than I wanted it to.
what choice?
to help you, to guide Neo.
now, since the real test for any choice is having to make the same choice again...
...knowing full well what it might cost...
...I guess I feel pretty good about that choice......because here I am, at it again.
do you know what happened to Neo? -Yes.
he is trapped in a place between this world and the machine world.
the link is controlled by a program called the Trainman.
he uses it to smuggle programs in and out of the Matrix.
if he finds out where Neo is before you get to him...
...then I'm afraid our choices are going to become difficult.
Why? -Because of who the Trainman works for.
the Merovingian.
he has placed a bounty on your lives. You must be careful at all times.
Seraph knows how to find the Trainman. He'll go with you.
for years he has protected me.
I hope he can do the same for you.
please, follow me.
Oracle...
I know, Morpheus.
I can see you're filled with doubt, clouded by uncertainty.
after everything that has happened, how can you expect me to believe you?
I don't.
I expect just what I've always expected:
for you to make up your own damn mind. Believe me or don't.
all I can do is tell you that your friend is in trouble, and he needs your help.
he needs all our help.
are you from the Matrix? -Yes.
no.
I mean, I was. -Why did you leave?
I had to. -I had to leave my home too.
sati! Come here, darling. Leave the poor man in peace.
Yes, Papa.
I am sorry. She is still very curious.
I know you. -Yes, in the restaurant of the Frenchman.
I am Rama-Kandra. This is my wife, Kamala. My daughter, Sati.
we are most honored to meet you.
you are programs. -Oh, yes.
I am the power-plant systems manager for recycling operations.
my wife is an interactive software programmer. She is highly creative.
what are you doing here? You do not belong here.
Kamala! Goodness, I apologize. My wife can be very direct.
it's okay.
I don't have an answer.
I don't even know where "here" is. -This place is nowhere.
it is between your world and our world.
who's the Trainman? -He works for the Frenchman.
why did I know you would say that?
the Frenchman does not forget, and he does not forgive.
you know him? -I know only what I need to know.
I know that if you want to take something from our world into your world...
...that does not belong there, you must go to the Frenchman.
is that what you're doing here?
Rama, please. -I do not want to be cruel, Kamala.
he may never see another face for the rest of his life.
I'm sorry.
you don't have to answer that question. -No, I don't mind.
the answer is simple.
I love my daughter very much.
I find her to be the most beautiful thing I have ever seen.
but where we are from, that is not enough.
every program that is created must have a purpose.
if it does not, it is deleted.
I went to the Frenchman to save my daughter.
you do not understand. -I just have never
heard a program speak of love.
lt is a human emotion. -No, it is a word.
what matters is the connection the word implies.
I see that you are in love.
can you tell me what you would give to hold on to that connection?
anything.
then perhaps the reason you are here is not so different than the reason I am here.
that's him.
get away! Get away from me! -We don't want trouble.
get the hell away from me! -We need your help.
I can't help you! No one can help you!
Oh, no!
damn it!
when is the train due? -lt is already late.
it's not like the Trainman to be late.
you think it has something to do with me? -I cannot say.
who knows such things? Only the Oracle.
you know the Oracle? -Everyone knows the Oracle.
I consulted with her before I met with the Frenchman.
she promised to watch Sati after we said goodbye.
goodbye?
you're not staying with her? -lt is not possible.
our arrangement with the Frenchman was for our daughter only.
my wife and I must return to our world. -Why?
that is our karma. -You believe in karma?
karma is a word, like love.
a way of saying:
what I am here to do.
I do not resent my karma. I'm grateful for it.
grateful for my wonderful wife, for my beautiful daughter.
they are gifts, and so I do what I must do to honor them.
Papa, the train! -Yes. Find your bag. Quickly.
can I carry that for you?
all right.
hurry it up, I'm late!
who are you? -He is a friend.
I know you.
so that's what they wanted. -I need to get back.
I'll pay you whatever you want.
one way or another, I'm getting on this train.
Oh, no, no, no.
you'll stay here until the Merovingian says different.
if I know him...
...you're gonna be here for a long, long time.
I don't want to hurt you. -You don't get it.
I built this place.
down here, I make the rules. Down here, I make the threats.
down here, I'm God.
get on the train or you'll stay here with him.
we should return to the Oracle. She will know what to do.
no. We know what has to be done.
shit.
you gotta be kidding.
holy shit, it's wingless.
I get it.
you must be ready to die.
I need to speak with him.
only way you're getting through this door is over my big, dead ass.
so be it.
there are no weapons allowed in the club.
at the bottom of this elevator, there is a coat-check girl...
...and if we are lucky, one man for checking weapons.
and if we're unlucky?
there will be many men.
can I take your--? Oh, my God.
what in the hell?
I don't believe this.
Hey!
the prodigal child returns.
are you here for the bounty, Seraph?
tell me, how many bullets are there in those guns?
I don't know, but I don't think you have enough.
I'll tell you what I will do.
put down the guns, and I will promise you a safe passage out of here.
all three of us? -Oh, yes, yes.
of course.
who could have guessed we would see each other so soon after our last meeting?
the Fates are too kind, eh?
and since you, my little Judas, have brought them here...
...I can only surmise that the fortuneteller has found herself another shell?
disappointing, but not unexpected.
I do hope, however, she has the good manners to learn her lesson...
...and to remember that there is no action without consequence.
and if you take something from me, you will pay the price.
you know why we are here?
come now, what kind of question is this? Of course I know.
it is my business to know.
some might think this is a strange coincidence, but I do not.
I am curious, though, as to how it actually happened.
do you know? -No.
no?
I did not think so.
but it is always best to ask, huh?
we want to make a deal.
always straight to business, huh, Morpheus?
okay. I have something you want.
to make a deal...
...you must have something I want, yes?
and it so happens there is something I want.
something I have wanted ever since I first came here.
it is said they cannot be taken...
...they can only be given.
what?
the eyes of the Oracle.
I told you before, there is no escaping the nature of the universe.
it is that nature that has again brought you to me.
where some see coincidence, I see consequence.
where others see chance...
...I see cost.
bring me the eyes of the Oracle...
...and I will give you back your savior.
it seems a perfectly fair and reasonable deal to me.
yes? No?
I don't have time for this shit.
you wanna make a deal? How about this?
you give me Neo, or we all die, right here, right now.
interesting deal.
you are really ready to die for this man?
believe it. -She'll do it.
if she has to, she'll kill every one of us.
she's in love.
it is remarkable how similar the pattern of love is to the pattern of insanity.
time's up.
what's it gonna be, Merv?
okay. You got yourself in here...
...you can get yourself out.
are you ready for us?
almost, sir. They got some pretty ancient hacks here.
but you found Neo? -Can't you see him?
no, sir. We read something, but I couldn't tell what.
I can't leave yet.
I have to see her.
now?
it's my last chance.
that's it. That's the secret.
you've got to use your hands. -Why?
cookies need love like everything does.
Neo!
I was hoping to have these done before you got here. Oh, well.
Sati, honey, I think it's time for a tasting.
take the bowl to Seraph and find out if they're ready.
okay.
I'm glad you got out. -Me too.
so do you recognize me?
a part of you. -Yeah, that's how it works.
some bits you lose, some bits you keep.
I don't yet recognize my face in the mirror...
...but I still love candy.
no, thank you.
remember how you were when you first walked through my door?
jittery as a June bug. And now, just look at you.
you sure did surprise me, Neo, and you still do.
you gave me a few surprises too.
I hope I helped.
you helped me to get here, but my question is, why?
where is this going?
where does it end? -I don't know.
you don't know or you won't tell me? -I told you before...
...no one can see beyond a choice they don't understand, and I mean no one.
what choice? -lt doesn't matter. It's my choice.
I have mine to make, same as you have yours.
does that include what things to tell me and what not to?
of course not. -Why didn't you tell me about the Architect?
about Zion and the ones before me? Why didn't you tell me the truth?
because it wasn't time for you to know. -Who decided it wasn't time?
you know who.
know Thyself.
I did.
then I think it's time for me to know a few more things.
so do l.
tell me how I separated my mind from my body without jacking in.
tell me how I stopped four sentinels by thinking it.
tell me just what the hell is happening to me.
the power of the One extends beyond this world.
it reaches from here all the way back to where it came from.
where? -The source.
that's what you felt when you touched those sentinels, but you weren't ready for it.
you should be dead, but apparently you weren't ready for that either.
the Architect said that if I didn't return to the source, Zion would be destroyed tonight.
please. You and I may not be able to see beyond our own choices...
...but that man can't see past any choice.
why not? -He doesn't understand them. He can't.
to him, they are variables in an equation.
one at a time, each variable must be solved, then countered.
that's his purpose. To balance the equation.
what's your purpose?
to unbalance it.
Why? What do you want?
I want the same thing you want, Neo.
and I'm willing to go as far as you are to get it.
the end of the war.
is it going to end?
one way or another.
can Zion be saved?
I'm sorry, I don't have the answer to that question, but...
if there is an answer, there's only one place you're going to find it.
where? -You know where.
and if you can't find the answer...
...then I'm afraid there may be no tomorrow for any of us.
what does that mean?
everything that has a beginning...
...has an end.
I see the end coming.
I see the darkness spreading.
I see death.
and you are all that stands in his way.
Smith.
very soon, he is going to have the power to destroy this world.
but I believe he won't stop there. He can't.
he won't stop until there's nothing left at all.
what is he?
he is you.
your opposite, your negative.
the result of the equation trying to balance itself out.
and if I can't stop him? -One way or another, Neo...
...this war is going to end.
tonight, the future of both worlds will be in your hands or in his.
how are you feeling? Are you all right?
I need time.
that figures. -Captain Roland.
what's up, Maggie? -Bane is. He's conscious.
good. Maybe he's got some answers.
I love that smell.
I sure am going to miss it.
Oracle. -I know.
I know.
Sati, honey.
take a few cookies and go with Seraph.
can I come back? I would like to come back.
I would like that too. -Then I'll see you tomorrow.
I hope so, hon, I hope so.
I'm scared, Seraph.
come.
he's following us.
well, well, it's been a long time.
I remember chasing you was like chasing a ghost.
I have beaten you before.
Yes, true, but as you can see, things are a little different now.
and you must be the last exile.
the Oracle told me about you. -Really?
what did she say about me?
that you were a bad man.
Oh, I'm not so bad, once you get to know me.
the great and powerful Oracle, we meet at last.
I suppose you've been expecting me, right?
the all-knowing Oracle is never surprised. How can she be? She knows everything.
but if that's true, then why is she here if she knew I was coming?
why wouldn't she leave?
maybe you knew I would do that, maybe you didn't.
if you did, that means you baked those cookies and set that plate there...
...deliberately, purposefully...
...which means that you're sitting there also deliberately, purposefully.
what did you do with Sati?
cookies need love like everything does.
you are a bastard.
you would know, Mom.
do what you're here to do.
Yes, ma'am.
I really wish I could help, but I just... I don't remember any of it.
what about the cuts on your arms? Those cuts are more than one day old.
Yeah, definitely.
you're right about that, sir.
they look like they might be self-inflicted.
but why would I do something like that to myself?
unless, of course, I wasn't myself.
but if I'm not me, then who am l?
has this man been tested for VDTs? -Yes, sir. It was negative.
but he is showing a lot of unusual neural activity.
some cross-synaptic firing, as well as signs of recent trauma...
...with fresh fibrotic scarring throughout the cortex.
I want the truth. I don't care what it takes. Make him remember.
sir, we found her.
the Logos? -Yes, sir.
about time we had some goddamn good news.
are the thermals picking up any signs of life?
no, sir. Nothing yet.
what about the ship? -Holographic says the hull's still intact.
drop down and keep a man in the turret. -Yes, sir.
get a full diagnostic on that ship as fast as humanly possible.
careful, sir.
the squids are sneaky bastards. It could be a trap.
what was that?
you can put that shit away, boys. All she needs is a jump.
Niobe. -Morpheus.
are you all right? -Yes, I'm fine.
we didn't know what happened after...
I'm sorry. -It's okay.
I'm happy to see you too.
did you get Neo out? -Yes.
how did you know about that? -The Oracle.
you saw her? -Just before the sentinels found us.
what did she tell you? -The same thing she always does.
exactly what I needed to hear.
in 12 hours, the machines will breach the dock walls.
every simulation we've run, we've seen that once the machines are inside the city...
...the odds of our survival decrease dramatically.
thus, our primary objective must be...
...to destroy or disable the diggers inside the dock.
if we can do that, perhaps we can prevent them from ever reaching the city.
if not, the only place we will be able to mount a defense...
...will be at the entrance of the temple.
it is small and will force them into a bottleneck...
...allowing us to concentrate the remainder of our defense.
we understand that you've requested additional volunteers.
that is correct.
precisely what size force are you planning to commit to the primary dock objective?
right now, the entire APU Corps and half the infantry.
half the infantry? -lf it were up to me, councillor...
...I'd take every man, woman and child, put a gun in their hand...
...and march them into that dock.
perhaps it is best that it is not up to you.
time will tell, councillor.
commander, just one more question.
has there been word from the Nebuchadnezzar?
none, and at this point there's no reason to expect there will be.
perhaps.
but we can hope.
I'm afraid hope is an indulgence I don't have time for.
Zee, what are you doing? -Making shells.
they're evacuating our level. We have to go.
I'm not going with you. -What?
they've called for volunteers to hold the dock.
kids, you stay here.
I know how you feel, but you can't do this.
I have to. -Why?
because I love him.
I love him the same as he loves me.
and if I were out there and he were here, I know what he'd do.
but you're gonna get yourself killed. It's crazy, Zee.
maybe it is. But ask yourself, if it were Dozer...
...and you knew the only chance you had to see him was to hold the dock...
...what would you do?
make shells.
what the shit is going on over here?
an accident, sir. I didn't see...
I'm sorry. -Who the hell are you?
a unit volunteer, sir.
what's a pod-born pencil-neck like you doing volunteering for my Corps?
I want to do my part, sir. We gotta hold the dock.
how old are you, kid? -Eighteen.
should have said 16, I might have believed that.
okay, I'm 16.
minimum age for the Corps is 18. Sixteen's too young.
the machines don't care how old I am. They'll kill me just the same.
ain't that the goddamn truth.
give me a chance, sir. I won't let you down.
you do, and you'll find me and the machines have got something in common.
okay, charge the igniter.
she lives again.
you want to reload the operations software, Sparky?
Yeah. Could you clean the windshield while you're at it?
uplinks in place. I'm bringing her back online.
looking good, except...
something's wrong with the Matrix feed.
no, there's not. You're looking at what we're looking at.
what's going on in there? -Whatever it is, it can't be good.
the machines have taken Junction 21.
the way I see it, if we drop down from broadcast here...
...intersect 153, we might surprise them.
we'll go first, hammer as deep as we can, then blow our EMP.
hopefully we can punch a hole big enough for you to get through.
it ain't pretty, but the way I see it, it's the only way back.
no, it's not.
there's another way. A support line.
it drops down right here, 1000 meters short of 21.
if we're lucky, we may be able to slip down without them ever knowing.
that's a mechanical line. It's impossible.
no one can pilot a mechanical. -I can.
bullshit. -I've done it.
that was a long time ago, Niobe. -I said I can do it.
so what? You'll be the only one that can. There's no way we can follow you.
Hi.
I know time is always against us. I'm sorry that I took so long.
but I wanted to be sure. -Sure of what?
I know what I have to do. -What?
there's no easy way to say this, so I'll just say it.
I have to take one of the ships. -What?
to go where?
to the machine city.
I know it's difficult to understand.
no, it's not. You're out of your goddamn mind.
I still have to go.
in 100 years, no ship has been within 100 kilometers of it.
you'll never make it. -I have to try.
ls this what the Oracle has told you? -No.
this is asinine. If you want to kill yourself, do it...
...but do it without wasting our ships.
you have to believe me. I have to go. -Bullshit!
I am the captain of this ship. I say where it has to go!
and this ship will go to hell long before I let you take it anywhere.
he can take mine. -You can't do that.
don't try to tell me what I can or cannot do with my ship after that little speech.
but for christ's sake, Niobe-- -I'll pilot this ship, he can take mine.
if we leave inside the hour, we should reach Zion as the machines do.
that's as good a plan as any.
it's a waste. A goddamn waste.
two ships, two directions.
sounds like providence, doesn't it, Morpheus?
you've never believed in the One. -I still don't.
then why are you doing this?
I believe in him.
thank you.
what's that for? -To help you relax.
to make it easier for you to remember.
what if I don't want to remember?
why would you want that?
what if I blew that EMP?
what if I did destroy those ships...
...and I am responsible for the deaths of all those men?
if I did that...
...it wouldn't be very safe for me here, would it?
of course, it might not be very safe for you either.
I'm ready.
Trinity...
...there's something I have to say.
something you need to understand.
I know I'm supposed to go.
but beyond that...
...I don't know. I...
I know. You don't think you're coming back.
I knew it the moment you said you had to leave. I could see it in your face.
just like you knew the moment you looked at me that I was coming with you.
I'm scared, Trin.
so am l.
it took me 10 minutes to buckle up one boot.
but I'll tell you something.
six hours ago, I told the Merovingian...
...I was ready to give anything and everything for you.
do you know what's changed in the last six hours?
no.
nothing.
finished loading ammunition? -Just about.
let's move it. We are out of time.
you're not leaving them anything?
he said he didn't need it.
I ain't saying goodbye. I'm saying good luck.
thank you.
I can only hope you know what you're doing.
me too.
it was an honor, sir.
no, the honor is still mine.
we're ready, sir. -About damn time.
we're already late, captain, so let's hit it and hit it hard.
Bye, baby.
take good care of them.
ready?
engine's still firing.
must be a fuse. I'll check it out.
I should've known he'd send his bitch first. -Bane.
no one ever got away from me as many times as you did.
I really can't express just how aggravating that can be.
what are you talking about?
I think I might enjoy killing you as much as killing him.
Neo, it's Bane. He's psychotic!
you're gonna pay for that.
twenty-seven kilometers to go. -We got an emergency.
what is it, AK? -It's Maggie, sir.
she's dead, murdered. I think it was Bane.
goddamn it.
I knew it. I knew he was out of his goddamn mind.
he fired that EMP.
goddamn it, I should have beaten it out of him.
we searched the whole ship, captain. He ain't here.
I know where he is. -The Logos.
we gotta go back. -Too late.
what if they need our help? -It's too dangerous.
Why? -Because if he's killed them...
...he'll control another EMP.
at this point, they're on their own. Just like us.
Mr. Anderson.
I see you are as predictable in this world as you are in the other.
what? -He's out of his mind.
it might appear that way. But Mr. Anderson and I know...
...that appearances can be deceiving.
confused, Mr. Anderson? It'll all become clear in a moment.
thank you for bringing me the gun. You can set it down there.
don't do it.
shoot. Shoot now. -Yes, shoot. Fry us. Burn us alive.
do it. If you don't, he'll kill us both.
look at him. He knows he should do it, but he won't.
he can't. -Do it.
back away from the gun and turn around.
let her go.
somehow familiar, isn't it?
we've been here before, you and l, remember?
I do. I think of nothing else.
who are you? -Still don't recognize me?
I admit, it is difficult to even think encased in this rotting piece of meat.
the stink of it filling every breath, a suffocating cloud you can't escape.
disgusting.
look at how pathetically fragile it is. Nothing this weak is meant to survive.
what do you want? -I want what you want.
Yes. That's it, Mr. Anderson.
look past the flesh.
look through the soft gelatin of these dull cow eyes and see your enemy.
no. -Oh, yes, Mr. Anderson.
lt can't be. -There's nowhere I can't go.
there is nowhere I won't find you.
it's impossible. -Not impossible.
inevitable.
goodbye, Mr. Anderson.
this is it. It's gotta be.
Oh, no.
I wish you could see yourself, Mr. Anderson.
blind messiah.
you're a symbol for all of your kind, Mr. Anderson.
helpless.
pathetic.
just waiting to be put out of your misery.
I can see you.
it's not over, Mr. Anderson.
it's not over.
Trinity! -Neo.
Neo.
Oh, no. Your eyes.
I'll be okay.
it's all right, Trin.
but I think you're gonna have to drive.
Seismic's projecting 22 minutes to breach.
they can't know we don't have an EMP. They'll have to attack in waves.
concentrate our offense on the diggers. Order the APUs into position.
Yes, sir.
come on, move.
all right!
this is it.
now, you all know me, so I'll just say this as simple as I can.
if it's our time to die, it's our time.
all I ask is, if we have to give these bastards our lives...
...we give them hell before we do!
Yeah!
you scared, Charra? -Shit, yeah.
but I'll make you a deal.
you keep loading, I keep shooting.
deal.
holy Christ, would you look at that. -Quiet.
how far to the opening? -1. 4 kilometers.
we're still generating too hot a field. -Ghost, kill all auxiliary systems.
give me full manual. Drop down four pads. -lt'll bottom out.
easy, baby. -Seven hundred meters.
if we can just get close enough...
six hundred meters.
there.
shit!
jig's up, here they come. -Give me full power.
man the gun turrets, every goddamn one of them. Go!
ghost, you're the best gunner, go with them. Morpheus, take his place.
I'm coming, baby.
here they come.
slow down, this ain't the Logos. -Hang on to your lunch, Roland, here we go.
holy Christ, I didn't know this ship could do that.
breach! The dock is breached!
knuckle up!
for Zion!
shit.
come on, let's go.
knuckle up!
reload!
reload nine!
go, go! Move, move!
watch your left!
don't let them through!
Oh, my God.
where the hell's my infantry? I want that goddamn machine taken down!
dig this!
Oh, shit!
bogey two at the breach point! -Goddamn it!
shit, she's got a fat ass.
keep them off me! -Christ, there's a shit storm of them.
you see that? -They're after the radio. Stop them!
damn it!
Yeah.
grab my belt.
just give me one clean shot.
damn it!
Charra!
I got incoming! -We got a dock full of incoming!
Yes, sir. But this is different, sir. -What?
I think it's one of ours, sir.
that's impossible. -Holographics are trying to confirm.
contact them. I want access codes.
we're trying, sir. There's no response.
it's a trick. That's not one of ours, it can't be.
that's a mechanical line. No one can pilot mechanical.
forward aft, 30 degrees at 80 percent. -Thirty degrees, 80.
lower starboard 60 degrees, 20 percent. -Sixty degrees.
what up, dipwads?
Oh, no, Jimmy Nickles!
gimme the money.
actually, we didn't bring it today.
here you go. - Gus!
give it up, Spencer.
or I'll shove a Jimmy Nickles and wich right in your grill!
I think it's a knuckle sandwich.
okay, okay.
and from the kangaroos?
see you tomorrow, butt munches.
it's Sloppy Joes and Tater Tots.
you know, Gus, one of these days, we're gonna stand up to Jimmy Nickles.
Yeah, I think I'll stay homesick that day.
it's about time.
sit down,
I have troubling news.
you forgot to tivo America's next top model, didn't you?
why is it so hard to set the season pass?
it's not top model related.
what is it?
Jimmy Nicholas called.
Jimmy Nickles called us?
from where? Prison?
I don't think so. It didn't sound like it.
what does prison sound like? Is there singing? - Shawn!
I don't know. He left a message.
don't you dare return that call.
I don't need to.
he's coming here in five minutes.
Jimmy Nickles coming here?
in five minutes? - Yeah.
okay, okay...
we can handle this.
we can handle this.
I'm gonna go print outa fake foreclosure notice and stick it on the front door.
and then we both can go outside and scrape the "psych" sign off the front window.
Gus, I think we can afford to relax a little bit.
he said he wants to talk, and by "talk."
I hope he means talk, not my head in a toilet.
he's gonna try and kill us.
he's not gonna kill us.
right?
I mean, people change.
we haven't seen him since the fifth grade.
I don't need to see him, Shawn.
some people are just born evil.
the kid from the omen, the children of the corn,
what is this?
Ooh, ebay!
auto bid.
600 bucks plus...
a penny--the penny's a trick.
I got in a full-on bidding war with a Montessori school.
what do we need a locker in the office for?
first of all, I have nowhere to put my sociology textbook.
and...
you always gotta hit it right on the nose, don't you?
why couldn't I be crockett?
because, Gus.
you stood in front ofthe entire third grade class and said,"when I grow up,
I wanna be Philip Michael Thomas."
dude, he's the biggest sausage in the world.
why is Jimmy Nickles coming here, Shawn?
how big is he now? - I don't know!
why couldn't you bea real psychic?
ey, you guys in there?
Oh, god, that's him.
he's not getting my lunch money, I'll tell you that much.
great, you can terrify him with your Wally Joyner mini-bat.
open the door.
what up, boys?
that's a good call with the mini-bat.
you d-bags gonna let me in or what?
D-bags?
Yeah, come on in, Jim.
huh!
way not to be scared, flincher.
I didn't flinch.
you know I have a caffeine tic.
look at this place.
video games, lockers.
you two haven't grown up at all, huh?
and you haven't grown up.
up...
at all.
Jimmy, as glad as we are to see you, what are you doing here?
what do you think I'm doing here, barfbeetle?
I came to take your lunch money.
hand it over!
I'm just messing around.
actually, I'm in town for, uh, work.
I'm sensing...
you became a jockey.
a jockey?
Yeah, one of the best jockeys.
Yeah, I won most of my races.
till this stupid Santa Barbara meet started.
now I'm on some ridiculous losing streak.
the last three favorites I've ridden have all lost.
and I know it wasn't something I did.
I started to lose all my best mounts.
Mounts?
horses, Guster.
what's wrong with you?
look, uh, Jimmy, what is it exactly you'd like for us to do?
well, uh, one of our friends from our old school told me about your company.
even though it sounds kinda gay,
I thought I could hire you to come down to the track and maybe, uh...
psychically figure out what's wrong with the horses.
okay, first of all, you ride on the back of mounts while carrying a whip.
that's much gayer than what we do.
either way, we're busy right now.
so I don't think - we'll be able to... -we'll take the case.
I thought so.
all right, meet me at the track at 2: 00.
and as far as anyone else knows, you guys are just some really good old friends.
got it, dillholes?
got it.
you can count on us dillholes.
good-bye, Jim.
are you crazy?
I wouldn't say crazy.
maybe an eccentric who looks good in jeans.
come on, gus, you're not actually still afraid of Jimmy Nickles, are you?
we're not helping that little monster, Shawn.
period. - Okay, so jimmy's still a jerk.
we can see that.
but the truth is...
I feel like I owe him.
for what?!
if anything, he owes us for 170 lunches.
you know, I added that up once, and with inflation, that's, like,$1, 800.
look, do you remember when Jimmy got kicked out of school in the fifth grade?
for killing a teacher?
for hitting miss Lepky with a spitball.
she fell and got hurt.
same difference.
she could've very well have been killed.
it was me who ratted him out, gus.
you did that?
why didn't you ever tell me?
you don't know all my secrets.
I'm a man of untold mysteries.
if he found out, he'd come back and gnaw off one of my toes.
ratting out Jimmy Nickles? That's suicidal.
I thought I saw him do it, and I told principal tropp, because he said he wasn't gonna let the class go until somebody gave him a name.
and what? You just had to get home?
dude, chips was gonna come on in, like, 20 minutes.
what was I supposed to do?
it was the one with the freeway crash.
where the car used the empty carcarrier trailer as a ramp and flipped in mid-air.
that happens in every episode, Shawn.
I was under a lot of pressure.
Jimmy Nickles did it! Your hair looks great
a: I always knew you were a kiss-ass.
and b: Who cares?
so Jimmy got kicked out.
it was the best day of my life.
I could finally wear underwear to school again.
I don't know, Gus.
I always sort of felt like I got the wrong guy.
I'll never forget the look on Jimmy's face when they hauled him out of class that day.
I didn't do it!
I promise, I didn't do it!
look, after jimmygot kicked out of school, there were all these stories about what happened to him.
he ran away from home, he got thrown in juvenile hall, moved to a small town in Kansas where they outlawe dsinging and dancing.
that last one is footloose.
that's a coincidence.
the point is, Jimmy's life changed that day, and I feel like I gotta make it up to him.
who knows, Gus, I might've stunted the kid's growth.
I don't know, Shawn.
we're talking about the same dude who made Aaron Rencher eat his own retainer.
all right, how about this
we take the case, right?
we prove, for all the Aaron Renchers of the world, we are no longer afraid of Jimmy Nickles.
all right, fine.
but if we take this case, we're gonna overcharge him by $1, 800.
done.
he doesn't like the oats.
or the alfalfa pellets.
they're too chewy for pellets.
pellets should be crunchy.
they should havea natural crunch to them.
also, the donkey in stable 11is a pathological liar.
this is idiotic.
look, it takes a while for the connection to take hold, Jimmy.
runny D. And i are just feeling each other out here.
whatever.
I gotta go lose five pounds before the next race.
you got half an hour to figure out what's going on.
what do you think, Runny D?
I'll tell you what he's thinking.
he's thinking, "I hate Jimmy."
he pulled my shorts down in front of Jenny Scarlatos in the cafeteria.
hmm?
are you channeling the horse?
or a little boy with a tight fade who used to wear his O. P.'S without a drawstring?
the horse, Shawn.
I didn't have a tight fade in the third grade.
Hey.
how are you?
that's interesting.
this place is weird and borderline depressing.
I mean, who are these people?
who actually comes here?
well, well, well.
this I never thought I'd see.
wow, dad.
tell me you're wearing that shirt because someone has to spot you from space.
very funny, Shawn.
this happens to be one of my lucky track shirts.
I like it.
I'd like it too, if I had to walk home in the dark.
this your kid?
Hey, kid.
Phil "the thrill" Shershow.
Shawn.
this is Burton "oil can" Guster.
good to meet cha.
Hey, Henry tell ya for 20 years,
I been handicapping horses?
that seems so very cruel.
he musta told ya I hit the pick six in '87?
hey Phil, I think it's pretty safe to assume,
I haven't told 'em anything.
five minutes to post. Gotta make it back.
Henry tell ya I likethe 2-3-4 trifecta box?
I think your shirt and his shirt should get together and go bowling.
ha ha.
you have all kindsof interesting pals.
I don't know about.
all right, Shawn, look, don't start. Phil is not a pal.
he's a bad gambler who doesn't know when to quit.
but he also happens to be on a hot streak right now, which is why I let him talk to me.
not that I need it.
I have won 8 of 11 races today.
all by myself.
all right, Shawn what are you doing out here anyway?
I tried to drag you out here for years.
I'm only here today'cause we're working on a case.
you know, I think the reason you never came out here is because to bea good handicapper, you gotta put in the time, you gotta do the research, you gotta study the horses, you gotta study the jockeys.
something that takes patience and follow-through, which you lack.
Yes.
that and a shirt from Mr. Furley's closet.
[Male announcer over P. A.] And the race is on.
babyfaced assassin takes the early lead.
babyfaced assassin strides into the first...
so what's the case?
have you ever heard of a Jimmy Nickles?
you mean Jimmy Nicholas.
Yeah, solid jockey, bad bet.
he's been losing lately.
that's why he hired us.
Yeah, the horses are losing, that's what's wrong with them.
Yeah, we didn't find anything.
of course you didn't, there's a million reasons a horse loses, and none of 'em have to do with crystals and moonbeams.
and it's youthful spirit.
youthful spirit pulls it out.
what I do is much more than that.
it's...it's intuition.
son, you got no case.
Oh, well, thanks. We'll just go home then.
help him!
medical assistance to the track.
we need medical assistance to the track immediately.
so...
a jockey who was alive at the beginning of the race is dead by the end.
not to sound insensitive, but I say we do have a case.
that sounds insensitive.
Yeah, I know.
and you guys just happened to be at the track?
Jules, it's free Churro day.
do they havea cause of death yet?
probable heart attack.
uh, O'hara, I...
need you to interview the rest of those jockeys.
what is that?
sorry.
it's just little people make me...
well, let's just say I had a bad experience with a Christmas elf.
what, he didn't give you the right present?
no. We dated.
she is an enigma wrapped in a little, blonde riddle.
Shawn, I don't think Juan Carlos died of a heart attack.
I only got to see him for a second, but I'm pretty sur ehe had bloodshot eyes.
and his bodywas totally stiff.
something affected his nervous system.
thank you, Dr. Pratt.
see if we can get another look at that body.
you bet.
Hey, you two, don't go anywhere.
I wanna talk to you when I'm done.
Gus has a cramp.
I have a cramp?
we have to pee.
fine, just be back in five minutes.
we gotta pee?
that's the best you can come up with?
just hurry up.
Really?
how short was this guy? Give it one more.
we have boots.
wait. Everyone stop.
let's acknowledge that the chief is wearing leopard print.
and continue.
I'm getting something.
no.
a rocket. Rikki Rocket.
C. C. Deville.
david Lee Roth? - Wrong band.
poison. - Yes.
poison.
he's right.
what? - You're right.
espinoza had a cocktail of drugs in his system.
opiates, barbiturates, cocaine, three different kinds of weight loss drugs, cyalis, and horse tranquilizers.
horse tranquilizers?
apparently, the guy took everything in sight.
he was 4'9" and 3 feet of that were drugs.
and obviously, his heart couldn't handle it.
a very thorough job, detectives.
I'm getting something else.
Shawn, how do you know this?
well, come on, who didn't?
anyone who wasn't an eight-year-old girl.
Uh-oh. I see a tall, blonde woman.
brigitte Nielson?
No!
she has 23 diamonds in her wedding ring.
shouldn't we at least find this woman and talk to her?
do you know anything about this, detectives?
your childhood must've been pure hell.
the good news,
I'm available for hugs.
Jules. How about it?
buddy. It's been a while.
please.
you're here early.
Yeah, couldn't sleep, you know?
came in early, did a little work on the case.
went for a run.
Oh, and I did this.
nice.
I did some work as well.
which doesn't make any sense.
cause Ketamine causes a stateof anesthesia.
the spitball incident?
Shawn, you need to leave that alone.
if you haven't figured it out by now, you never will.
I can't leave it alone. I won't.
I've gone over it in my head a thousand times.
just hear me out.
what are you doing here?
this is my head, dude. I can do whatever I want.
what did we miss? What's going on here?
is that what my hair looks like in the future?
it sure is.
but I thought I'd be bald by 20.
this changes everything.
Yeah, it does. Think big.
Ahh!
it was Jimmy.
whoa, whoa, whoa.
he's sipping through the straw, not spitting it out.
it couldn't have been him.
there was a second spitter.
that's so cool.
let it go, Shawn.
your second spitter theory is crazy.
Oh yeah, what about your teen wolf theory?
Hey, that's just a fact.
if any of us were in high school and some dude became a wolf, we wouldn't be cool with him just because he could dunk a basketball.
Oh, save it for your podcast.
Hey, you brought it up.
I'm gonna go talk to Jimmy Nickles.
you look for T. B.W.
T. B.W? - Tall blonde woman.
I abbreviated, Gus. All the kids are doing it these days.
Oh.
just hope we don't run into my--Y. D?
y. D?Your dad.
and it's too late.
Oh, my god, the shirt has a brother.
ha, very funny, Shawn.
Seriously? I wonder why.
isn't that Barry Sarner?
the announcer guy. He's like a local legend.
Yeah,"the voice," right? - Yeah.
Hey, dad, do you know him? Can you introduce us or what?
no, I met him once at a policeman's ball, but it was years ago.
Hey, uh, Mr. Sarner. - Hi.
look who's here.
your old pal.
do I know you?
no, but we know you.
what is it you always say?
and the race is on.
and the race is on.
and the race is...
on!
Hey, can you do it for us one time?
and the race is on.
that's it, right there.
won't you boys have a button?
I'm sorry, Mr. Sarner.
I'm Henry Spencer.
this is my son Shawn and his friend Gus.
they finally just started coming to the races.
Oh, too bad.
the track's probably closing down after this meet.
25 years I've been doing this.
why is it closing down?
well, no one comes anymore.
is it because of his shirt?
I'm sorry, dad, this is, like, a genocide of color.
somewhere, a rainbow's weeping.
Mr. Sarner,
we're his buddies. We came down to see him.
no, uh...
it's a shame, really.
Jimmy was just getting back to a full schedule.
Really? We didn't know that.
Oh, they quarreled about it all the time.
did they?
Shawn, look.
way to stay on the abbreviation train, Gus.
you mean the A. T?
you're talking about Janine? - That's Jimmy's wife.
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
I didn't kill Juan Carlos!
I didn't do it, I swear!
come on!
you gotta believe me!
back off.
okay, so let me get this straight.
you took on this case because you felt bad that led to Jimmy being arrested for murder.
did I ask for nutshelling?
I think he looks like a tangelo in that outfit.
or maybe a Klementine with seeds full of hate.
I think he looks like an evil little creamsicle.
you mean dreamsicle.
no, Shawn, creamsicle.
they're exclusively orange.
okay, Lassiter says you can have five minutes with Jimmy.
sweet.
and good job, by the way.
you didn't tell Jimmy that, did you?
no.
I didn't kill Juan Carlos.
we know.
someone must've tipped'em off.
but I swear I didn't do it.
guys!
look...
I think what Gus is trying to say is we'd really like to help.
we would, but the evidence.
what?
Juan Carlos took all your mounts. - Yeah.
you fought with him over it. - Yeah.
they found Ketaminein your locker.
that wasn't mine.
all right, Purvis, put me down.
don't push me.
I'm getting the feeling he didn't know about the affair.
you think?
I'm sorry, I just
I can't believe she would do that.
especially after I told her
I wouldn't sleep with any more russian models.
I think we may have gotten off point, Jimmy.
let's go back to the beginning.
so is there anything else you can tell us or that you remember about those races?
no. The horses were all running great.
but right around the, uh, clubhouse turn, they all faded down the stretch.
all of them faded down the stretch?
you know what?
Yeah.
good.
that's a good place to begin.
all right, that's enough, Shawn, let's go.
you've been standing at that thing for an hour.
let me take off my shoes and try it lying down.
no, Shawn. You don't have anything.
it's a dead end. Face it.
we have to tell Jimmyhe's screwed.
fine. You tell Jimmy. - Me?
I never wanted to take this case in the first place.
I'll race you for it.
What?! No.
that's right. And I know why.
Why?
please!
first of all, you know I hadsh in splints, a torn meniscus, and a planter's wart.
you have no idea what they mean!
ask my doctor.
I had a ruptured patella too, but I wasn't gonna say anything.
besides...
go! - Oh, no!
no, you didn't! Oh!
you almost had me.
what? I had you by at least a foot.
I'm gonna give this to you.
I thought so.
not because you won.
what?
Oh, no. We're going again.
I got a better idea.
Gus, this is the perfect spot for us to see you'll find
to see where the magic happens.
I told you he'd be here.
can I help you fellas?
uh, yeah, uh...
and the race is on.
I really don't think you should be up here right now.
Ooh, can I do one?
I've always wanted to be an announcer.
would the owner of a red iroc-z
and turn off your headlights.
what do you think of that, huh?
have a button.
Hey.
I've seen one of these before.
Yes, it's a shaman's staff.
Yeah, I saw a specialon the history channel...
about the--the Choctaw Indians.
ah yes, the Chaka Indians.
long-standing rivals of the sleestak cowboys.
it's pronounced choe-koe.
gave us the chocodile, amongst other things.
I don't think so.
I'm actually 1/16 Indian myself, but not Cherokee.
Hey, Gus is...1/16 robot.
Mm.
Oh. Sorry.
Hey, you're the guy that tried to save Juan Carlos.
yeah...
you're the only one who tried to help.
Yeah.
uh, he died.
Yes, he did do that.
Yeah.
well, gentlemen, uh...
Ryan and I have to go oversome publicity photos.
so if you'd be kind enough...
and the race is on!
Chaka? Really?
Yeah, I'd be embarrassed if I were you.
I'm not embarrassed at all, Gus.
a land of the lost reference is virtually unheard of in everyday conversation.
can we go and see Jimmy now?
not yet.
Barry has tapes of the races in there.
which means there's a copy of the one Juan Carlos died in.
I don't know why I didn't think of this before.
we need to see that tape.
there's no way Barry's gonna let us back in there.
don't the police hav ea copy of it?
they do, but Lassiter'sc onvinced the case is closed, so he won't help.
which means I'm gonna have to do something I know I will regret.
what? Ride your dirt bike off of David King's roof again?
no...
ask my dad for a favor.
so I was hoping that in your very meticulous, detailed mode, it occurred to you to...
I can't do it.
he wants to know if you tape all the horse races.
of course I do.
awesome. Can we watch the one when Juan Carlos died?
you may.
on one condition.
deal is you go with me to the Derby on Sunday in that shirt.
what did I say about regret, Gus?
what did I say?
I think you pull it off.
fine.
all right, here's the race.
Juan carlos is on the number eight horse.
the one time I go with the guy, and the horse loses.
I don't get it. What are we missing?
What--what aren't we seeing?
maybe nothing.
maybe Jimmy did poison Juan Carlos.
I know he didn't poison Juan Carlos, just like I know there's a second spitter.
close your eyes.
you need to broaden your vision, Shawn.
you need to lookat the outskirts of the case.
what does that even mean?
broaden my vision?
look at the outskirts of a-- you know what?
I'm out of here. No.
no, no. Not today.
you sound like Oprah.
I don't even know why I bother coming here.
it's a complete waste of time.
a little girl outside just started crying when she saw this shirt.
Oh, good, good, you're here.
you texted me seven times.
said it was an emergency.
Yes, a color emergency.
but I think I figured it out.
the walls were sandbar white to suppress all creative thought and hide the asbestos.
the walls of what?
miss Lepky's classroom.
why is my nameon the detention list?
you got caught eating a kit kat out of the trash can.
the point is, when I left my dad's...
you mean stormed out like a little girl?
I did not.
I did.
I'd give you that.
I realized my dad was actually right.
I needed to broaden my vision, and that's when I remembered we all switched seats in class that week.
right, I had to sit behind Janie Doran and her creepy neck hair.
and Jimmy...
moved over two rows, meaning that the second spitter was on the other side.
Gus, get him.
Shawn, what does this have to do with horse racing?
Mm-mm, I haven't gotten that far yet.
let me know when you figure it out.
let go, Jimmy.
Hello?
dude, I figured it out.
was that really necessary?
no.
but it was dope.
babyfaced assassin strides into the first turn at the head with none other right on its tail.
babyfaced assassin -wait for it.
babyfaced assassin...
right there! The clubhouse turn.
Juan Carlos gets hit by something.
I was so focused on the stretch that I never looked anywhere else.
you know, I didn't broaden my vision, dad.
Shawn, I love nothing more than to tell you I'm right, but I have no idea what I'm right about.
question is why would somebody kill someone like that?
guys!
Juan Carlos's death was an accident--yeah!
whatever hit him was meant for a horse.
this isn't about murder.
it's about fixing races.
the tapes ready? - Check.
fake psychic ability? - Full of it.
Yes, you are.
Mr. Spencer, what is going on?
first you help us get--oh.
get Jimmy Nicholas.
now you claim he's innocent?
I'm sorry, chief.
psychic solar flares have temporarily blinded me.
lilacs in a meadow.
is that camay?
my eyes are starting to adjust.
where are we?
we're in the video room!
I'm blind, Gus. Not deaf.
if you wanted
those tapes.
what are on those tapes?
they're the tapes from the track.
we reviewed them, but we didn't find anything.
Doritos. Big gulp?
Slurpee.
7-11?
these are all the dates on the tapes.
let's play these tapes.
these are Jimmy's races.
this one is when Juan Carlos died.
that must be why they're in my head.
all of these horses faded down the stretch, as if affected by something.
and look here.
he felt the effects immediately, because he's a tiny human person.
and your point is?
whatever hit Juan Carloswas intended for his horse.
what I'm saying is that this was an accident.
Mr. Spencer, that's a very interesting theory, but it's all circumstantial.
we're gonna need some hard evidence.
Yeah, but thanks for the A. V. Class.
youthful spirit fades down the stretch.
no, wait, he's-- he's gaining.
it's youthful spirit, youthful spirit pulls it out.
youthful spirit fades down the stretch.
no, wait, he's-- he's gaining.
it's youthful spirit pulls it out!
the announcer.
it's the announcer.
he sounds surprised.
"Neigh," shocked.
youthful spirit fades down the stretch.
no, wait, he's-- he's gaining.
that means he's a part of it.
chief, every psychic nerve in my body tells me that something really big is gonna happen at the Derby tomorrow and that we all need to be there.
all right.
it's too late to cancel the races, but I can approve a police presence at the track.
I've never been in the jockey club before, Shawn.
thanks for getting me in here.
it's a good thing we wore our lucky shirts, huh?
Yeah, just worried someone's gonna stare directly at the pattern and have a seizure.
Shawn, we've had people watching Barry for the last six races, and they haven't seen anything out of the ordinary.
admit it, you guys don't have it.
don't worry. We have it.
I don't know if we have it.
we just gotta figure out how it all connects.
so what is this indian stuff I got off the internet connect to?
that's what we in the fake psychic community call a hunch.
ladies and gentlemen, the horses have reached the starting gate and the race is on.
Uh-oh, two horses bump as they come out of the gate.
it's the three horse, snare the prize, and the four, biased opinion.
Kate's conscience takes the early lead as the horses reach the first turn.
authority figure makes a strong move on the inside as the horses race down the backstretch.
authority figure begins to take control.
authority figure...
Phil is not a pal.
he's a bad gambler who doesn't know when to quit.
but he also happens to be on a hot streak.
Henry tell ya I like the 2-3-4 trifecta box? Huh?
track's probably closing down after this meet.
25 years I've been doing this.
dude, I got it. Get everyone down to the track.
and authority figure wins with ease.
I really would like to cash in my tickets now.
well, how did she feel coming around the backstretch?
everybody hold your horses.
I meant metaphorically, but I like the love.
I sense the plan.
hatched from the desperation of watching the track they all love so much shuttered forever.
isn't that right...
excuse me?
you are so not excused.
you see, the track is closing down this year, and Barry finally figured out a way to get paid.
but it was the equine who told me he had help.
two people with intimate knowledge of the races and access to the entire track.
they figured out how to control the outcome of the races by getting rid of the favorites.
they bet on the rest of the field,
that is insane.
we didn't do anything.
that's not entirely true. Whoa.
whoa, what's happening here?
Gus, little help, buddy.
I don't do horses, Shawn.
Dale, uh, hold that thought.
what was I saying?
Barry was saying they didn't do anything.
Really?
you used Phil to make all the bets on the long shots.
and Ryan here
well, he took careo f knocking out the favorites from his perch in the camera well.
with what, his camera?
exactly.
lassie, do me a favor.
take that camera off Ryan's neck.
give it a look.
there's no lens.
it's some kindof firing mechanism.
I just wanted to make some money.
it was Barry's idea.
shut up, Ryan. They can't prove anything.
I'm getting something.
a fraction.
Barry's 1/16 choco Indian.
and what are the choco Indians known for?
besides chocodiles.
for using blowguns to kill animals with darts dipped in poison.
Gus shoots and scores.
with an assist from wikipedia.
they used dartsdipped in Ketamine.
a horse tranquilizer strong enough to slow down a horse in the middle of a race.
with darts small enough to be missed on a 1,000-pound horse.
but the problem was...
they accidentally shot Juan Carlos.
the Ketamine, mixed with all the other drugs in his system, and the adrenaline from the race killed him.
you weren't trying to save Juan Carlos's life.
you were looking for the evidence.
and they almost pulled it off by framing poor Jimmy.
but they couldn't resist one more big pay day in today's race.
it's like my dad always says...
real men take bubble baths.
and...
a bad gamblernever knows when to quit.
not bad, kid. Not bad.
let's go. Get 'em out of here.
now...
who wants to take a picture withthe winning horse and jockey?
come on, dad! Gus, get over here.
memories, Shawn. That's what it's all about.
just act natural. Yeah.
guys, I don't know what to say.
I guess you're not such total fart knockers after all.
Thanks.
That's...so sweet.
Gus, isn't there something you wanted to say to Jimmy here?
Yes, I do.
I've been wanting to say thi sfor a long time.
you know, back in school.
Oh, uh, about that.
I had some time to think while I was in jail, and, uh...
maybe I didn't treat you guys so good back then.
especially you, Guster.
so I'm sorry.
I'm sorry for giving you wedgies, swirlies, Jimmy Nickle sandwiches, stuffing you in the trash can and, uh...
putting boogers in your clarinet case.
feels good to get that off my chest after all these years.
huh, yeah. I could imagine.
say, Shawn, isn't there something you want to get off of your chest?
are you gonna tell him if I don't?
what do you think?
all right, Jimmy, here's the thing.
I'm the one that ratted you out over the spitball incident.
okay, I'm the one that got you kicked,
and I am the one that you should blame for almost ruining your life, it was me.
almost ruining my life?
Yeah, I went to live with my dad in Maui.
he let me do anything I wanted.
I ate pizza and cookie dough for breakfast.
I had a race car bed.
I lost my virginity at 13.
it was the greatest thing that ever happened to me.
you two are back together, huh?
dude, she's a former Miss Oxnard with no sense of smell, and her dad owns an airport.
course we're back together.
Latro, boys.
okay, see...
that right there makes total sense in the world.
Yeah, but we can feel good about solving the case.
eh...
don't you "eh" me.
dude, I broke up a highly intricate race-fixing syndicate
Yes, yes, you did, Shawn.
Gus. - Yes?
you didn't.
Yes, I did.
you did that?
and you never told me about it?
you don't know all my secrets, Shawn.
I guess I too am a man of untold mysteries.
I am seeing you in a completely different light.
you are, dare I say, dastardly.
Hey, I didn't want Miss Lepkyto get hurt or anything, but when Jimmy got blamed, my mouth was shut.
unbelievable.
face it, Shawn.
I am, and always will be, that good.
that's why my friends in school used to call me "the G."
huh, that's funny, I thought they called you "big head burton."
don't you ever say that name.
I know it was youth at started that.
I'm sorry, Gus. I have a knack for alliteration.
I'm a slave to it.
besides, how many words start with B, really?
about 1, 000.
how about Bold? Black? Beautiful?
who's gonna call you"black burton"?
you get my point, Shawn. - All right.
I'll tell you what.
I'm gonna buy you an ice cream.
and we're gonna discuss some new, fresh to death nicknames.
how about...
Burton, "the billowy bear"?
what?
I'm just spitballing. It's my first shot.
july
lines got to be strong, you see?
no time to think. Just let it happen.
paint's like your blood, telling the whole world you've been up here.
you all right, little man?
come on, man.
I can't move, Carlos.
just got to stop looking down. Look up.
look, you can do it. Come on.
I got you.
when it's darkest, men see stars.
aren't no stars, Leon.
not in my universe anyway.
no stars? What do you mean?
ma kicked me out. I tell you that?
like I don't even exist.
ain't nobody bombing like Blaze.
take a picture.
by the time I'm done, the whole city's gonna know my name.
Oct.82
what, are you taking a trip?
no. A friend bought a condo in Boca.
thinking of investing myself.
looks quiet. It's probably a good place to write.
what's that supposed to mean?
didn't Hemingway live in Florida?
I need to talk to someone about my son's murder.
well, I'm detective Lilly Rush.
my partner, Scotty Valens.
what was your son's name?
killed October 11, 1982.
someone sprayed paint in his mouth till he suffocated.
I, uh, put his things in storage.
last week, motel where I work in cut my hours.
can't afford the storage anymore?
like most, can't afford much of anything.
when I was cleaning it out, I found this in his backpack.
Philly
Yeah, seen these back in Narc.
it's a graffiti writer's black book.
it's why I need to talk to you.
I told the police back then my son was nothing but a huffer.
he was sniffing paint?
well, I'd catch him huddled up with a paper bag and paint cans, stealing money out of my purse...
he never talked about graffiti?
we hardly saw each other.
I had to work three jobs just to keep a roof over our heads.
you thought he was an addict.
so I kicked him out.
but he was an artist, wasn't he?
you ever see Carlos after he left the house?
he'd sneak in after I left for work, raid the fridge.
left his backpack once.
next day, they told me he was dead.
look at this one.
it was October 11, 1982.
that's the day Carlos died, right?
it looks like part of a bigger piece, but there's no other pictures.
you know where this photo was taken?
I wish. Like to see it myself.
you know who Carlos was hanging out with
other taggers, uh, friends?
no idea.
mistake I made, kicking him out of the house.
something here.
Carlos bombed over someone else's work.
anarchy?
some kind of insult?
that's a declaration of war.
hard-core punks in that world?
no way they're letting him get away with it.
well, maybe NRKE got even, dropped a bomb on Carlos.
Carlos Espinosa. 16 years old.
body was found in an alley in Kensington on October 11, 1982.
autopsy report indicates a skull fracture.
M. E. found chips of paint in the gash on Carlos's head.
cause of death was asphyxiation.
someone bashed his head against the wall before that paint was forced down his throat.
assigned figured another huffer jumped Carlos, used his own can of paint against him.
murder weapon found under some debris
couldn't lift a print.
well, see if you can trace the can, locate the retailer.
victim had three healed broken ribs at the time of his death.
well, mom kicked him out, and Carlos was living on the streets.
lot of ways for a kid to get hurt out there.
any idea where he racked his supplies?
well, mom said she found receipts in his jean pockets
uh, small stuff like gum.
that's an old trick. Pay for something cheap so no one's suspicious, then shoplift the paint.
well, the receipts were from a Harold's Hardware.
I'll show them a photo, see if maybe someone remembers Carlos.
had a steady hand. Clean lines.
looked into NRKE.
the crew was notorious in the 80s for violent street justice.
so, Carlos was killed in their hood?
Yeah, two blocks from their clubhouse. - Well, we're going to need names.
I'm meeting with the head of the Graffiti Removal Commission, uh, Don Bardwill. Been on the scene three decades.
says he knew NRKE up close and personal.
Curtis, hey. Uh, I was wondering...
yeah?
... how you and your ex agreed on custody.
that's what you were wondering?
well, I wouldn't say that me and the soul crusher agreed on anything.
so, you petioned for visitation?
wait. What's going on, Kat?
Jarrod sent me a letter.
he got married, moved back to Philly.
he wants Veronica to stay with him two weekends a month.
what are my options?
well, you could play hardball, force him to file a custody complaint.
would Veronica have to testify?
strong possibility.
what else? - I don't know. Sit down with the guy.
there's probably a way to work it out.
how do you work it out with an ex-banger who wants custody of your kid?
I could come. Uh, not as a lawyer.
you know, just as your boyfriend.
Yeah, okay. - Yeah.
but...
never said you were my boyfriend.
I'll see you... later.
Oh, hey, lover boy.
we need to talk. - So talk.
in private.
got something to show you.
so... uh...
here, give me a hand, will you? We-we're looking for a, um...
private criminal complaint.
filed by Moe Kitchener. - That's it. Against one Lillian Rush.
let's see.
you put a boot on his car.
harassed his loan officer.
gave him a night in the drunk tank with...
Tico? - Yeah.
he forget anything? - It's not the first complaint he's ever filed.
Yeah, but this one's from the DA's Office, Lil, not IAB.
these guys can prosecute you for a crime.
Thanks. Got it.
I don't know what's going on with you, but...
this could cost you your career.
you done talking yet?
Hey, you're on your own.
always have been.
called me the Graffiti Gestapo back in the day. - Colorful name.
cruised around in my Mercury Monarch with a gallon of paint, removers.
people say these kids are vandals, crooks.
wonder why.
just neglected kids trying to show the world they exist.
painting murals gives them an outlet.
beautifies the city in the process.
Yeah, you got that list we asked for?
NRKE, right? It's here somewhere.
turbo 102. This look like the same tag?
judging by the way the T's slanted, I'd say it's him all right.
who is he? - Good question.
Guasy's been bombing the city almost three decades.
are you saying he still hits places today?
most bombers leave churches and cemeteries alone.
Turbo's got no respect for anything or anyone.
do you know where this photo was taken?
too small to make out any landmarks. Where'd you get it?
kid we're looking into, Carlos Espinosa.
this was his black book. Went by Blaze.
Oh, I know that tag.
you didn't mention Blaze on the phone.
is that why you asked about NRKE?
why, is there a connect?
blaze was new on the scene.
NRKE taught him a serious lesson.
what the hell you doing, hermano?
just trying to get my name on the map.
you got to dis to get noticed.
nobody bombs here without going through me.
this is NRKE's wall.
fool, I am NRKE.
this is pretty.
it's better than what was up there. Yeah.
who is this kid?
you think you got style?
this is my block. I'm the king.
you'd better get somebody else to do your writing, man.
you're cocky for somebody who's about to get his ass beat.
turn him over.
I catch you capping my spot again, I'm gonna feed you this can.
Hey, get out of here, narc, or you're next.
it's what happens when you leave a bunch of kids on their own.
you call the cops?
drove straight to a pay phone.
by the time they got there everyone was gone
including Blaze.
explains the broken ribs.
what about the thug? Head of NRKE?
called himself Tut.
one thing I know:
nobody disrespected the King.
Philly's finest looking for a new paint job?
shop's a step up from tagging with NRKE.
NRKE. Haven't heard that name in a while.
understand you were the King.
took it pretty serious.
thought I was bombing the system, leaving my mark.
just a bunch of hoodlums running on the streets.
investigating the murder of Carlos Espinosa.
went by the tag of BLAZE back in 82.
not a bad throw up.
Prolly would've messed him up real good if I would've caught him.
got a witness says you were doing exactly that.
gonna feed you this can. Sound familiar?
look, uh, back in the day, thought the only thing you had in this world was your name, your reputation.
well, toy like Carlos disses you, you gotta show him you mean business, right?
Mm-hmm. But the boy came around a few weeks later, tail between his legs, and the King granted him a pardon.
believe this?
fool's stupider than I thought.
I want to g-go.
come on, Leon. You got my back, right?
bring us a punching bag, hombre?
it's cool, Leon. I got this.
drank too much, disrespected you and your whole crew.
hell, everybody knows the King's tearing it up all over.
I got a peace offering.
next time, bring better beer.
come here.
I saw your tag up on the Alleghany water tower.
going higher next time.
you got a lot of sack, climbing up there.
fall off a roof, go to heaven.
highest spot of all.
say, man, toy like you needs a crew.
a place to crash.
throw slo-mo here some scraps.
you all planning any pieces? Burners?
come on, man, this is NRKE.
all-out destruction, man.
you know what I'm saying?
you want pretty pieces, you going to yourself a graffiti coloring book.
all right. Let me think about it.
what's there to think about?
NRKE reigns supreme, nobody comes close.
can we g-go now?
Yeah, man. Just-just give me a minute.
be careful, man. That chick's dangerous.
Hey. I'm Carlos.
not anymore.
now...
you're mine.
thought he was gonna join the crew, make me look good.
and he turned you down?
can you believe it? Thought I was giving him the keys to the castle.
now, who was the kid with Carlos?
never knew his name. - What about the girl?
uh... Gina something.
always writing with that nasty orange.
she part of your crew? - She wanted to be.
told her she had a sloppy hand with no style.
you know how she got her tag, Talon?
heard she, uh, clawed out some guy's eyes.
tried to warn Carlos, but once she got it in you, she ain't never letting go.
yeah?
Carlos's last piece.
ID put it under a complex magnifier.
get anything? - The wall has oval-shaped bricks.
there's one place in town with those bricks: the sewer system.
tagger's MO is to get his name up where everyone can see it. Why go underground?
the last piece he ever drew.
chance it could shed some light.
lot of sewers, boss.
distribute a flyer with Carlos's photo and a Polaroid of his last piece.
pwd workers, homeless shelters.
maybe we get lucky.
I tracked down the owner of Harold's.
said Carlos was seeing one of his employees.
Yeah, fired her once he realized she was stealing all the spray paint.
you show her photo to "King Tut"?
ID'd her as Talon. Will's tracking her down now.
Talon, huh?
well, it's time we stick our claws in her.
so, you, um...
moved from Detroit?
last month. Yeah, finally got settled. Unpacked the last box.
and got the girls enrolled in school.
I have two daughters, Connie and Cassie.
we got a place with a bedroom for Veronica, too.
painted it her favorite color. - Purple.
lavender, baby. - Right, lavender.
cause apparently there's a difference.
sorry. I gotta go.
Dame. - Ah, gracias.
your mother, she gets more beautiful every day.
he does that to get out of doing the dishes.
think I don't know your tricks, viejo?
how's your knee, Ma?
mm, doctor said it's fine.
so, you going to grace us with your presence on Sunday?
I'm making arroz con gandules.
Valens. - Hey. Pierson.
got another purse snatching outside the Dayley's Market.
same MO. Older Hispanic lady.
taking her statement now.
uh... hold her till I get there.
- Yeah.
I'm sorry, Ma, I gotta... take this. It's work.
it's always work with you, Scotty.
when you gonna slow down?
Sunday. Arroz con gandules.
sorry, we're closed.
what can I do for you?
nice stuff for a girl from the streets.
graffiti vandal turned boutique owner.
graffiti taught me skills.
how to market my name, resilience, respect. What's this about?
know where this was taken?
never seen it before.
ever go to the sewer to tag? - Why would I do that?
to hang with your boyfriend, Carlos Espinosa.
Carlos wasn't my boyfriend.
you stealing all that paint from Harold's Hardware just for yourself?
I did a lot of crazy things when I was a teenager.
racking paint for a boy I liked was just one of 'em.
crazy is a good way to put it.
arrested three times for vandalism.
one for aggressive assault.
the assault was self-defense.
not the way the judge saw it.
my stepfather used to beat me.
one day he got the idea to toss me out a third-floor window.
clawed his eyes out to stop him.
fluorescent orange is still your signature color.
I like orange. Is that a crime?
no.
but this is...
heard he was killed.
I didn't know it was like this.
Carlos thought no one could touch him.
he was wrong.
come here, I want to show something.
blaze and Talon.
it looks alive.
I've never seen anything like it.
your name should be up high.
I see you.
toe to toe Yeah, who told you to look?
why don't you just write your last name up there, too, Leon?
use the name I gave you. Turbo.
the fastest tagger in town.
so, what's with you and speed bump?
don't say things like that, all right?
he might start believing it.
sorry.
he's got a raw deal, that's all.
pretty decent of you, letting him tag along.
everybody needs someone, right?
get down! Get down! - What's wrong?
got some cop after me.
he always knows where I'm at. I don't know how.
he chased me down an alley with a flashlight, said he was gonna bash my head in.
what for? - I don't know. Guy's obsessed.
he's always buffing out my tags.
I catch you, you're dead, Blaze!
that-that's him! Run!
Carlos was different.
always taking care of other people.
this is the guy who was chasing Carlos?
could be. - Carlos's friend, Leon
you're saying he was Turbo?
that's what Carlos called him.
said he found him in an alley, eating out of the trash.
where can we find him?
six feet under. He fell off a roof a week before Carlos died.
thank you.
we'll be in touch.
so, if Turbo's dead, who's using the tag Turbo 102?
I bet Don Bardwill knows.
Hi. Detective Valens.
uh, thanks for waiting, Belen.
your case is similar to another case I'm working.
Yeah, I-I already told that other young man everything.
sorry to put you through this again.
can you tell me what happened, por favor?
hoodlum came out of nowhere, pushed me down.
ran off with my pocketbook.
you get hurt?
scratched my knee.
I'm fine.
did you get a look at the guy?
my eyes aren't so good anymore.
what was he, white, black, Latino?
all my groceries are in the trunk.
my ice cream's melting.
help me get this guy off the street.
stop him from doing this again.
I have to go. - Belen...
there are other women he's done this to.
women like you.
you've spoken to them?
I...
I know... what he did to you.
I wasn't strong enough to stop him.
I tried to scream, but he put his hand over my mouth.
he... put his hand over your mouth?
my husband is the only man I've ever been with.
he told me to stop looking at him.
that was the only thing he said to me.
you...
you saw him?
Oh, yes.
things we gotta do...
get a nurse to see you...
uh, uh, I don't know, no.
look, anyone that cares for you...
they're gonna understand...
it wasn't your fault.
I shouldn't have been there.
it wasn't your fault.
you hear me, Belen, hmm?
I have to go.
my ice cream's melting.
graffiti Gestapo.
you get that nickname for getting physical with bombers like Carlos?
course not. I was trying to clean up the streets, not take on gangs.
clean up the streets.
that include chasing kids with your flashlight?
threatening to beat them?
might have tried to scare some punks.
you ask me, degenerates had it coming.
someone's got to step up and do something about it. Right?
I was taking back our city. What, by stalking Carlos? Hunting him down?
hey now, I never stalked anyone.
so how'd you always know where he was at?
I got calls when kids were bombing.
told me where to go.
always the same voice.
you saying someone was ratting out bombers?
don't know who it was. Didn't care.
made my job easier.
what about Leon? Chasing these kids around town.
you finally catch one?
don't know any Leon.
Oh, Carlos's little friend.
took a nosedive 13 stories off a roof a week before Carlos was murdered.
sorry to hear that, but like I said, don't know anyone named Leon.
want to tell me why your name's on his accident report, then?
says here that you were a witness to his death.
the date's October 2.
Ten-two. One-oh-two. Sound familiar?
give you a clue. Leon's nickname was Turbo.
One-oh-two-- the day he died.
now, you got photos of his tags all over your office.
you know every single place that he hit.
so tell us. Who's Turbo, Don?
I don't know.
I just wanted them to stop.
I didn't think it would go that far.
when it's darkest, men see stars.
don't be scared, Turbo.
this spot's gonna make the angels weep.
I w-want to see s-stars, Carlos.
you want stars? - Yeah.
you got stars. Let me see that first.
when
Emerson? Now who's that?
you said there weren't any stars. That's what you said. Remember?
did say that, but I was wrong. All right.
check this out.
freeze, you maggots! - Oh, somebody narced us out!
come on! Come on! Come on! Let's go!
come on, killer. Come on, let's go!
come on, Turbo!
you can do it!
get you, you little bastard!
help! Carlos! - I got you, man.
Carlos! Help! - I got you, man. I got you.
get out of here!
I'll tell them it was just me.
go before the cops come!
go!
night...
changed my life.
can't fix what happened.
but I've tried to do some good.
if Carlos was alive today, I'm sure...
he'd be doing exactly what I'm doing
giving these kids some hope.
what the hell was that, Kat?
I'm trying to help you out here.
I'm-I'm sorry.
I... I couldn't take it.
well, that much I got.
look, if Jarrod wants to see Veronica, he's gonna have to go to court.
okay, I'm-I'm gonna have to warn you.
his-his lawyer's gonna present a guy who's been clean for five years.
I leave you alone at the table, and now you're defending him?
I'm just saying how it's gonna look in court.
look, judges try to give parents contact with their children.
no, this is different, Curtis.
he's an ex-banger. You're not.
he's still her father.
not everyone deserves a second chance.
I'm sorry you feel that way.
in my book, guy should be able to see his own kid.
ma'am?
there a problem, lady? - No.
got to move the car.
tracked the orange paint can that Carlos was killed with.
manufacturer sold it to Harold's Hardware.
store where Gina worked.
excuse me.
I'm Eddie Clark.
work at the Fairhill soup kitchen.
saw one of your posters. I know this boy.
was there when he painted this piece.
don't hardly do it justice, though.
beautiful, ain't it? Just like I told you.
spent a lot of time down here back then.
man, where...
where did you learn how to do that?
the streets.
must be some damn angels on the street you come from, 'cause I ain't never seen nothing like that.
got us an artist in the sewer.
ain't an artist.
you tell that to them.
what you...? What you call it?
when it's darkest, men see stars.
that's what my friend always wanted.
you got a gift, brother.
a real gift.
you could do something with that.
what are they doing?
maybe they want to see stars, too.
still come down from time to time to look at those stars.
remind myself how far I've come.
you recognize those stars from Gina's clothing line?
Yeah. Our famous designer said she'd never seen this mural.
dead on site. Talon.
what kind of girlfriend leaves a message like that?
recognize this, Gina?
so I capped his burner. Doesn't mean I hurt him.
you want to read that for us?
dead on site. It was just an empty threat.
you two have an argument?
almost 30 years ago?
you can't expect me to remember ancient history.
you've been pawning Carlos' stars off as your own for nearly that long.
he wasn't the type to care if somebody was biting his work.
orange paint can that killed Carlos was sold at Harold's Hardware.
it's not like you think.
I was all alone.
I need his help...
but he wouldn't do it.
Carlos, there you are.
I've been looking for you.
a junkie jumped me in the park.
I need someone to watch my back. I couldn't find you.
leon died.
he fell.
it's my fault he was up there in the first place.
the streets aren't safe.
that's why we need a crew.
look.
it's the most I ever racked from Harold.
now we've got something to offer NRKE.
what do you want with those thugs?
they've got a clubhouse, a place to stay at night.
think they'll let you in their crew?
they will if you take me.
tut said you can join them.
you don't get it. They're bombing 'cause they're punks.
I'm done with that.
all right, I don't care about getting my name up.
I want to do something.
help people.
in the sewer?
nobody's going to see your work down here.
they already have.
look, I want to do something with this, Gina.
you could, too, if you'd just... - Bombers are getting clipped left and right.
NRKE is the only crew whose tags don't get taken down.
right. You're right.
their tags never get buffed.
ever.
I got to go do something. - No, no...
just wait right here. - Please don't leave me.
I'll be back, I promise.
he never came back.
I was so mad, I slashed his mural.
I heard the next day on the streets, he'd been killed.
you said he took your paint?
five cannons of my signature orange.
know where he went?
no. He was right, though.
there's more to life than just bombing.
question is: Where did he go with that paint?
Yeah, only the one can found at the crime scene.
wasn't any graffiti in that alley.
look. The wall behind Carlos's body is completely bare.
it seem odd to you-- a whitewashed wall in NRKE territory?
would have been hit a hundred times.
that wall's got a story to tell.
let's peel back the layers.
your liquor store, your gym, your El stop, your dear mother's church.
playing a game-- This is Your Life? Cops must be bored.
sit up.
listen to the lady.
above your liquor store, Turbo 102.
on your gym marquee, Turbo 102.
on the church door, Turbo 102.
that your tag? - Tut is my scribe.
Yeah, in the 80s. Then the mayor cracked down, you need a new tag, one nobody could connect to you.
that... that all you got, huh?
random coincidence in my hood?
matched the paint samples from Turbo 102
with auto paint in your body shop.
it's expensive, but... you get it wholesale, right?
you got me, I'm, I'm Turbo 102.
you stink like a rat.
who you calling a rat, man? I'm the King.
Yeah, King Snitch.
made anonymous calls about Carlos and his friend Leon.
I ain't no rat, man. Lowest life-form there is, except for pigs.
got something else you want to say, hmm?
come on in, Don.
a snitch used to call him every day.
always the same voice.
now he loves to talk. Go ahead, say something.
say something! - Son of a bitch, you're a dead man, man!
that's him.
sit your ass down. - That's police brutality, man!
no, brutality is what they do to snitches in the badlands.
other bombers found out, you'd have been a walking corpse.
Carlos was about to share your dirty secret with the whole neighborhood.
you had to shut him up.
look, I tried to give that fool an out. - But he wouldn't take it.
little punk thought he was better than me!
Yeah, thought he could ruin your rep.
spent years getting up, building my name.
Yeah, you said a name was the only thing you had in this world.
reason I took his.
bitch thought he could get me killed, thought he could be King.
there's only one King.
what the hell you doing?
been waiting for you to get here.
Yeah, my boys been telling me you been putting up lies.
I'm here to take 'em down.
your boys combing the streets so you can rat us taggers out?
turbo 102. That's your new name?
I kind of like it.
that's my boy you got killed with your snitching.
it's my tag now, bitch.
don't even touch it. Leave it alone, man.
said I'm gonna take it down. That's what I'm gonna do.
I'll take it down myself if you lay off other bombers.
you giving me orders?
I'm the King!
it ain't about staying up.
we can do more, change things around here
everyone dying on the streets.
you high or something?
I said take it down.
what's the life expectancy for a snitch?
take it down.
you might as well not even exist.
take... it... down!
guess that's the only way you're going to stay King 'cause it sure as hell ain't your skills doing the trick.
ernest
Mary, help.
what's going on?
do you think he would ever touch you?
No!
Willy!
get her! She's sober. She'll squeal. - Willy, get up, man.
come on, Mary!
help!
Mary!
Mary! Mary!
Mary!
come on, Mary.
we're just having some fun.
let's just talk. - Get away from me.
Hey.
come on.
it's gonna be all right. Your friends are okay. It's all right, it's okay.
it's just a little prank.
come on.
let's go check on your friends.
you stupid bitch!
Mary?
Mary.
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.
I'm sorry.
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.
there you are.
Where's the girl?
I don't know. I thought she was in here, but she's not.
shit. -- She probably passed out somewhere.
come on, we gotta find her.
that was over 30 years ago, but her rotting body is still there waiting to be discovered.
bullshit.
bullshit.
no, it's true. I swear to God. My mom told me in complete confidence.
well, complete confidence doesn't mean much when you drink vodka like it's water.
shut up.
stop it! - So you don't think it's unhealthy for them to stay home on their own homecoming?
not everybody wants to be homecoming queen.
it didn't hurt me.
you're right.
and I only wish I could've been there. -- No, you were too old and serious.
thanks a lot.
that story doesn't make any sense.
I mean, why don't the girls stick up for themselves? I don't get it.
maybe if you weren't always speaking out, like in the school newspaper...
...maybe we'd have dates to the homecoming dance.
okay, so you changed your mind.
you think it's fair football players get academic credit for going to practice?
you shouldn't have published the picture with the article.
they took the picture as a joke. You published it out of context, without...
guys. I've got another ghost story.
that wasn't a ghost story, Mindy. It's an urban legend.
an urban legend is a made-up story people keep telling as if it was true.
like the guy who eats Pop Rocks, drinks soda and his stomach explodes.
like that bullshit about Mindy's brother's camp counsellor getting his arm stuck in a soda machine, and it falls on top of him.
that wasn't bullshit.
and it was a candy machine.
Oh, and like Bloody Mary. -- Who's that?
supposedly, if you go into the bathroom and turn off the lights and chant "Bloody Mary" three times into the mirror, she appears.
her face is like a corpse. And if you look at her, well...
...then you have to turn the lights back on before she drags you in.
in where?
I don't know. In the mirror?
I heard she'll haunt you forever.
that's not even a real urban legend. That's just like that movie Candyman.
well, my story was real. - As real as your mother's new tits.
what's the first thing you'll do when you're mayor?
I haven't won yet. - But you will.
a lot can happen, so...
but so far...
what's going on in there? -- I don't know.
well, the first thing I'm gonna do is propose a 9 p.m. Curfew on all teenage girls.
I'll keep them off the streets, keep them safe.
keep them virgins.
I'm afraid that might be too late.
bloody Mary.
bloody Mary.
bloody Mary.
who is it?
David.
asshole.
so, David, you're back early. Shouldn't you be at the dance?
I'm sure it's still going on. -- Oh, yeah. Well...
I was there long enough not to see any of you.
we didn't want to go that stupid popularity contest.
and why is that? Oh, because you couldn't get dates?
Yep, that's exactly what happened. Football team put us on the blacklist.
we could've gone.
we just preferred to stay here and have some female bonding.
Hey, Mindy. Nice.
shut up. - David!
Oh, and just so you guys get it right...
...Candyman ripped off Bloody Mary in the first place.
not the other way around.
how long was your brother outside listening to us?
long enough to masturbate. - Not long at all, then.
David.
so how was it?
just like yours, I'm sure.
you didn't wake up naked in Tijuana.
just because there's a dead Mexican hooker in my room doesn't mean I went to Mexico.
Oh, Bill drank all my lemonade.
David, be nice. You know, and you could call him "Dad" once in a while.
never happen.
but I still call you "Mom."
mom, I need 100 bucks.
do me a favour. Go wake up the girls.
all right. Just because you own me, it doesn't mean I'm your slave.
go. -- Yeah.
they're already gone.
she's never done this before. I mean, this is so unusual for her.
I have to call Sheriff McKenna. -- Okay.
Yeah, Sheriff McKenna.
it's Bill Owens.
any word, anything?
we're doing all we can. You have to understand they're not officially missing for 24 hours.
Yeah, but they are missing. -- Hello.
that's it, nothing? All right, well, you just stay on top of this.
all right, look, when do we call in the FBI?
our hands are tied. We'll do all we can locally.
officially missing for 24 hours.
but they are missing.
right this way, sheriff.
sheriff. Thanks for coming. -- Hi, Bill.
I appreciate it. -- No problem.
the mountain gorilla.
an endangered species native to Central Africa. Mountain gorillas live in groups ruled by a dominant male which determines the group's daily activities and enforces a very strict social order.
the silverback.
do you think Samantha and her friends are okay?
Yeah.
and consume 20 times their weight in food annually.
I just spoke to Sheriff McKenna, and he's got all his men out searching.
they're gonna find her. -- Sure, that's easy for you to say.
she's just your stepdaughter.
What...?
Sam.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.
they all say the same thing. They woke up in the basement of the abandoned old mill on the other side of the state park.
the door was locked. Well, that's what they said.
what do you mean?
well, we're gonna check it out. They don't remember anything.
other than that, they're fine. Weren't harmed or mistreated, nothing.
we ran blood tests and found traces of Rohypnol in their system.
it's a date-rape drug.
you don't have to worry about that. We ran medical tests.
they were not abused in that way.
so, what do you think?
well, it could be the girls' idea of a practical joke.
you know, for attention.
what happened?
what happened? What's wrong?
what's wrong? What happened to you?
my mom says that it's all a stunt. That they did it to themselves.
Samantha will write a story about it for the paper.
some people have no boundaries.
some people need to mind their own fucking business.
the girls are back.
they were in science class.
took them long enough.
you'd think twins would have some kind of sixth sense...
...like I'd know what happened to you.
we're fraternal, not identical.
how you holding up?
it was Buck and his friends, wasn't it?
he told us they just wanted to talk.
you are butt-white.
Hey, Roger. -- What?
you need to spend some more time at that tanning salon.
Hey, girls dig it, man.
he doesn't go to that salon to go tanning.
he goes to hook up with that chick.
the one with the big tits. -- Oh, yeah.
buck.
what's up? -- Come here. Come here, check it out.
what? Oh, yeah.
I know it was you. All of you. I know it was all of you.
what did your sister...?
we don't know what you're talking about.
we were at the dance all night. Ask our dates.
get out of here, loser. - You little punk.
Yeah. Get out of here. - Get out of here, man.
get lost. - You're not gonna get away with this.
whatever. -- Oh, I'm scared.
come on, get out of here. -- That's what I thought.
Bye-bye. -- See you.
we got a problem. -- This is not a problem at all.
those bitches, they won't say anything.
Yeah. Take Buck's advice.
what did you get on your SATs, Buck? Seven hundred?
total.
what's that supposed to mean?
you're such an asshole.
she needs to relax.
see you later, mama's boy.
shut up. Shut up.
no way. Shut up.
Yeah. Totally. Shut up.
she did not. No way.
Oh, my God. He's here. I gotta let you go.
Hi, Roger.
Hi, Betsy. I hope it's okay I just showed up.
don't worry about it. I'm, like, the only one here.
I just wanna catch some sun.
lay on the bed a little bit, get my groove on.
then maybe I could get some of your sunshine.
okay.
how long do you want it?
just leave it on low. I'm gonna relax for a bit.
I'll get out when I'm done.
I'll be ready.
totally. Like, yeah, I saw it.
he is so hot.
Yeah, totally. Most people go nude.
totally.
Yeah. Totally.
no. Totally.
Yeah.
totally.
shut up.
help! Betsy!
yes way. My past. I could be president.
what time is it?
Oh, shit. Roger!
Oh, shit.
Roger! Roger! Roger!
Amen. -- Amen.
peace be with you.
thank you, Father.
Samantha?
Samantha?
Hey. --Hey.
I brought you homework you might have missed when you were gone.
I saw how Buck was looking at David at the funeral.
Heather, you know that David had nothing to do with Roger's accident.
Yeah.
listen...
...I know that things have been difficult for us.
it was so much easier when we were kids.
God, Sam, we were so close. What happened to us?
it's funny you should say that.
Why?
because it sounds like it came from a TV movie, that's why.
look, what happened to you was just a little payback prank...
...and I had nothing to do with it.
the guys didn't mean to go so far...
...but they were pissed off you published that photo.
just a prank?
they drugged us, and who knows what they did to us after they locked us up. I sure as hell don't.
how hard was it to crawl out the window?
that's not the point, Heather.
look, Sam, there's more.
it's...
this has all happened before. - What do you mean?
we'll talk about it tomorrow.
make sure and do your history homework.
I'm sorry.
she brought me my homework.
she felt bad. She was cool about it.
damn it.
you sure you don't want a ride? -- No, I'm good. Thanks.
Heather!
Heather!
Heather!
Heather!
Heather!
Heather!
Heather!
Heather!
Oh, my God!
unit 14, we have a 174...
what's going on?
what happened?
Sam, what...? Sam, talk to me. What's going on?
ashes to ashes and dust to dust.
she was in bed. How could they be crawling out of her face?
I think it's really sick, though.
they were coming out of her face.
now, I'm sure you've all noticed the new security precautions on campus.
every effort is being made to keep our students safe.
now, Principal Rosetti has asked me to remind everyone...
Samantha, dear.
is something the matter?
no.
well, as I was saying students who need to speak to a counsellor should tell their advisor.
so how was school today, honey?
I saw a ghost in science class.
do you really think that he did it to himself?
Roger Dalton was dumb...
...but don't you think that he would wake up before he cooked his ass?
what are you saying?
I'm asking if you really think there's nothing more to our friends dying.
Heather dropped some acid and just ripped her face off like a mask?
of course not.
she didn't even drink, let alone do drugs.
there's something wrong in our little town, and it has a name.
Owens. - David?
both of them. They were there both times.
Jesus, Buck.
murder?
so, what are we gonna do?
your dad still have those emergency gas cans?
get them.
and meet me behind the park at midnight.
I don't know about this, Buck.
come on. Scaring the girls is one thing, but...
right.
okay.
I'll be there in 15.
holy shit, this guy's dick is smoking. Hey, McKenna better check your beer bottle tonight.
did you ever hear the story about a guy who was drinking a beer...
...and found a finger in the bottle? Look at this.
someone cut his ring finger off.
wild. -- Will you stop with that crap?
that finger is probably some coyote's lunch.
Yeah, we got EMTs on the scene.
Worthington High School classes have been cancelled today.
another student from that school was found dead.
although drunk and driving...
...Early reports suggest electrocution as the cause of death.
Tom Higgins, a varsity football player...
there's something else going on here.
Heather left this in my American history book the other night.
I think someone sent this to Heather as a warning.
this is the same thing that happened to you.
only I'm still alive.
here.
read the other one.
professor at Alpine University kills students using urban legends as M.O.
wait, you think there's a copycat killer that's killing our friends.
no, I just think that Heather was trying to tell me something.
I need your help to figure it out.
well, it's about time you asked.
Mary Banner lived here in Utah. She went to Worthington High.
it says the other two girls returned home unharmed.
they should still be alive. See if you can find it online.
are you smoking crack? This is dial-up. Let's use the school database.
school's closed today. -- I have keys to the newspaper office.
okay.
let's just get down there and finish this.
wait, wait, go back.
there.
the two girls, seniors at Worthington High refused to press charges against unknown assailants.
why no names?
got them. Gina Lotnick, 17, Mary Banner, 18, and Grace Taylor, 17.
where are they now?
Oh, that's from '82.
local resident Gina Lotnick died this morning of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.
miss Lotnick was one of the victims in the homecoming kidnapping in 1969 of which there are no suspects.
Mary Banner, another victim, was never found and presumed dead.
who was the other girl? -- Grace Taylor.
the only remaining survivor of that fateful night is Grace Taylor.
Hey, got it. It's not that far from our house.
Hey.
Hey, Coach Jacoby.
what are you kids up to?
Oh, nothing. Just some extra credit, you know.
the school's closed.
and that goes for your newspaper.
you're gonna have to leave.
now. -- All right, cool. Thanks, coach.
Hey. - I just feel like I'm cracking up.
I know it's tough, but we shouldn't blame this on a bunch of ghost stories.
I don't know what to believe.
these just seem like awfully big coincidences.
they're odd, I'll give you that.
they're either accidents, or there's a killer out there.
there's no ghost.
but there is something.
I mean, there's something connecting this to what happened to me to those girls in '69.
we're gonna find out what it is.
grace Taylor is gonna tell us.
this is it? - Yeah, it's groovy.
come on.
power to the people. Free Angela Davis. What's up?
Hi, I'm Sam, and this is my brother, David.
so? -- So we wanted to talk to you.
miss Taylor, we wanted to talk to you about what happened at homecoming 35 years ago.
power to the people.
right on.
you take your shoes off.
have a seat, kiddies. You want some tea?
no, thank you. -- Penicillin?
Oh, yeah, we would love some tea.
so, what do you kiddies want to know about that night?
well, we were hoping you could tell us everything.
professor at Alpine University kills his own students using urban legends as his M.O..
there were five of them, including that devil bitch, Dawn.
Gina and I were tricked, drugged and left 20 miles from home in the woods...
...all because we didn't worship them like the rest.
everyone said that we just got wasted and passed out.
no one wanted to cop to the truth.
that happened to me too.
I know. I read it in the papers.
but you all came back in one piece. My best friend...
...Never came home.
get that.
it's Mary. -- What is?
the murders.
it's Mary Banner. Looks like urban legend, but it's Mary.
but she's dead, isn't she? -- Oh, she's dead, all right.
but her energy, her life force, is very strong.
always was.
you kids know that nothing ever dies, don't you?
it just changes form, you know, like water into ice into water into steam into water into ice, you dig?
wait, so you're saying a ghost is killing these kids.
but that doesn't make any sense. Why would she be killing us?
why not just go after the people who actually did this to her?
the children will always suffer the sins of their fathers.
your friend Heather had a devil-bitch mother by the name of Dawn.
well, Mary wants revenge on the five people who took her youth...
...so she's taking their children.
that's where she's starting. Who knows where she'll stop.
she has always had to have her way.
come on, you're not buying this, are you?
miss Taylor...
...we need to know the names of the boys who did this to you...
Oh, baby.
I can barely remember how to tie my shoes let alone the names of our dates.
but they were all on the football team.
this is ridiculous.
I cannot believe you believe her. - I can't believe you don't.
this is as bad as when you thought there was a vampire living under the porch. - I'm starting to wonder if I was right.
kidding.
Heather's mom went to Worthington, so we can assume she was involved along with Roger's and Tom's dads.
so we have to figure out who's next, probably Buck.
Sam, Mary Banner isn't killing people. She's dead.
it's more likely that Grace Taylor is doing this.
look at these.
did you steal these? -- Yeah, just look at them.
the handwriting is just like on the envelope that was sent to Heather.
grace sent the clippings to Heather.
this is how Heather died.
I saw the spiders, but no one believed me.
this one's a girl, but the same thing happened to Roger.
Oh, God.
they're all coming true.
Oh, God. We have to find Buck.
he won't be hard to find. Let's get out of here.
buck, we need to talk to you. -- What?
you gonna write about me in the newspaper?
no, I just think that... -- Come on.
I'm sorry that we played a stupid fucking joke on you and your friends.
but did Roger and Tom and Heather deserve to die for it?
do you honestly think I could kill someone over a stupid, asshole jock prank?
look, Buck...
...do you know about the kidnappings at Worthington High in 1969?
that was something that he did when he was young.
it's like a rite of passage.
wait, you're talking about your dad? -- Yeah.
my dad was pissed about the picture you put in the paper. And the article.
he told me about how he and his friends would have handled it.
so Coach Jacoby was one of the boys involved in the kidnappings? The Mary Banner case?
Yeah, but he didn't hurt her.
he didn't even know what happened to her.
she just disappeared.
she didn't die like Heather did.
buck, I'm sorry.
all right, come on, we gotta get out of here.
I'm worried about Buck.
well, he's a source of worry, I agree.
I think that Buck's dad killed Mary Banner. I think he's lying to Buck.
Oh, and I'm sure you got this info directly from Mary Banner.
well, I saw Coach Jacoby at her grave after Roger's funeral.
wait a minute.
you think Coach Jacoby had something to do with these murders?
no, I mean, not directly. I just think that...
what? You were gonna say something.
this might sound strange, but I think...
she thinks that the ghost of Mary Banner is killing people.
guys, if either of you have information, real information you better stop fooling around and tell me.
just lik e that. -- Oh, baby.
you're so nasty.
Yeah, that's it. -- Spank me.
that's it. Oh, yeah.
so good. -- You love it.
Oh, yeah.
so big. -- Come on.
right there. Right there. -- Yeah.
shit.
damn it.
under.
okay.
what the hell?
holy shit.
Oh, Jesus, Chewy, did you eat another skunk?
that's right. -- Oh, God.
don't stop. Don't stop.
come on. Right there.
you lik e it, huh?
Hey, don't look now, but Coach Jacoby's crying.
maybe something happened to Buck. - Maybe someone cut his kidneys out.
Hey. - Long time no see, Sam.
have you guys seen Buck?
have we seen Buck? -- Yeah, his dad looks really upset.
Yeah, well, Buck got himself good and killed last night.
Yeah, I heard he got crushed under a vending machine.
he tried to snag some free chips, and then smash.
did your mother drink while she was pregnant?
in the news, they said he got his throat cut by a prostitute in some sleazy motel.
wait. Buck's dead?
maybe you shouldn't be so concerned with his well-being.
he certainly wasn't concerned with ours.
four down. One to go.
are you still looking for clues?
God, you were fat.
did you know that Grandpa was bald?
guess you can kiss your hairline goodbye.
Yeah, and Grandma has a moustache.
I think Heather was trying to tell me something.
we know that her mom was one of the people involved in Mary Banner's disappearance.
why don't we ask Heather's mom who the other boys were.
Yeah, and then what?
and then we'll know who's left on Mary Banner's hit list.
Sam, I appreciate your community spirit...
...but most people in this town don't.
most people think... - I'm one bolt short of a nutcase.
that I should have been drowned at birth.
Yeah, in that general direction.
where are you going?
we need to talk to the police, but we need evidence.
I'm going back to see Grace.
Oh, that's smart, walk straight into the jaws of death.
I don't think she's the killer anymore. She's afraid to leave her house.
but I think she knows who the killer is.
okay, call me. - Yeah.
Hello?
grace...
...are you here?
shit! You scared me to death.
what are you doing in my house, X-Man? How did you get in?
the door was open. -- Oh, yeah.
for the cats.
you're lucky.
you almost got sprayed with bug spray. Hit.
what do you want? Spit it out.
I really need you to tell me the name of the football players who abducted you all those years ago.
please, Grace.
I wouldn't tell then, I won't tell now.
did anyone ever tell you that you look exactly like Foxy Brown?
that's smooth, brother.
very smooth.
you know...
...Anyone who wanted to could have found out who those boys were just by looking at the pictures in the school archive.
in the archives?
right on, Gracie. Thank you.
damn it.
Oh, my God!
Willy. Willy!
Willy!
don't leave me in here, Willy.
Willy!
Willy!
there's Grace.
Where's Mary?
Hello, Mary.
who's your date?
there he is.
holy shit.
no. No, stop.
leave me alone. No.
leave me alone!
grace.
grace, you need to get a phone that works.
grace, please.
please.
what does Mary want with me?
Mary's visited you too, huh?
find her.
find her and bury her.
but I saw her grave.
you saw a tombstone, baby girl. She's not buried there.
Gina and I looked for her for years.
nobody ever found her body.
she could be anywhere.
I think I know where she is.
I hope this is what you want.
Sam!
Samantha!
Hey, it's the Owens. Leave a message.
David, are you there?
David, if you're there, pick up the phone.
David.
I think I know where the body is.
I know... I know you think I'm crazy, but...
this is the one piece of evidence that we need to bring it to the cops.
when you get this message, meet me at the school, okay?
you have my k eys.
meet me at the side door.
I forgot to tell you.
your brother went over to the school.
great. He has my keys.
you're just gonna have to take me in your car.
no way.
I have not been back there since homecoming, 1969.
please. I would take my bike, but it'll take me too long.
no, I can't!
look at me.
grace.
damn.
you have to promise me that you will bury her when you find her.
David!
David, open the door!
David! - Shit.
David, open the door!
David?
I saw someone in there.
was it Mary? - I don't know.
maybe.
I'm gonna climb through the window.
I'll go around and open the door for you.
no, hey, I'm cool. I'll wait in the van.
Oh, damn.
shit.
grace, I got her.
grace, wake up.
shit. I found her, Grace.
grace, I really need your help.
grace. Shit.
damn, that's some chronic. Shit.
grace.
Oh, no.
Oh, Grace.
are you okay?
Oh, shit.
grace.
Oh, no.
Oh, my God.
Oh, fuck.
Hello? - Bill.
bill, thank God. -- Sam, where are you?
I'm at the cemetery. - Calm down... Sweetie.
your mother... Sam, what's going on? - What?
I can't hear you. You're in a what?
I can't hear you. - Where are you?
I'm at the cemetery.
fuck. Fucking cell phones.
bill.
thank God you're here. I really need your help.
all right, just calm down and tell me what's going on.
I found the body. Now I have to bury it.
Mary Banner's body.
I finally found it, and now she wants me to bury the corpse.
here, sweetheart, I got it.
this ground's frozen.
okay, I just don't want you to worry about this.
I'll take care of it.
everything will be fine.
did you hear that?
that might be Coach Jacoby.
don't worry about him. I can take care of him.
does anybody else know about this body?
no, just me and David.
did you say anything to your mom?
Samantha.
someone, help!
someone, help me!
did you tell your mom? - No.
help! - You leave her alone!
get out of here, baby! Go on!
Willy Owens.
you're gonna go down.
you wait until the city council hears about this.
Samantha!
come on, sweetheart, I don't want to hurt you. I just wanna talk.
Samantha!
I'm sorry I hit you.
I... I have a problem with anger management, but I'm okay now.
what's gonna happen to your mother if I go to jail?
because she won't have David anymore...
...because David is dead.
you're crazy!
what the...?
grace.
I...
far out.
no one is ever gonna believe us.
Samantha.
follow the tracks down the hill.
Hey, now.
I fall asleep again? -- Yep.
bill.
you mean "punk."
they're saying he died of a heart attack.
I guess something must have scared his butt real bad.
you gonna be okay?
I guess this will just be another ghost story.
something to talk about around campfires and slumber parties.
baby girl, you're the urban legend now.
a decades-old mystery was finally solved last night...
...when police discovered the body of mayoral candidate Bill Owens dead of a heart attack while apparently attempting to dispose of the remains of Mary Banner a local girl who disappeared over 30 years ago.
while police refuse to confirm it, a source tells us that it was Owens who was actually responsible for Banner's death on that fateful homecoming night in 1969.
I gotta know.
Oh, what about your birth mom?
I really just told you everything, didn't I?
these people are lying to you.
they lied to Sutton. They're lying to each other.
I thought you said you and Justin were waiting.
then I guess we kind of stopped.
I'm sorry. I should've known better.
I know how lies can tear a family apart.
as a lawyer, how can you tell if someone is hiding something?
that's an excellent question, Sutton.
you're getting soft, man.
you go in there, right now, and break up with her.
I just have to leave.
did you really think you were pulling this off, Sutton?
you've gotta let me get back together with Char.
what if I decided to reinstate those possession charges?
I'm starting to regret sending this letter.
it could really get her in trouble.
then maybe you should go back there and make things right.
maybe.
how could I think that everything would work out here?
Ethan, I have to leave Phoenix as soon as possible.
wherever you go, Emma, I'm coming with you.
excuse me, sir. How much longer till Phoenix?
won't be too much longer, if you get back in your seat.
wake up, sleepyhead.
happy birthday, honey.
per tradition, breakfast in bed.
waffles, butter, syrup.
I know you hate it, but there's no escaping.
this is great. I don't even know what to say.
you can start with your birthday wish.
but if I say it out loud, it won't come true.
duh! That's why we always do the bogus wish.
like last year, what I wished for - anybody remember? Anybody?
that you never get a boyfriend.
that's right. - And now I have one.
okay.
I wish I could run away and never come back.
okay... - Excellent. Excellent.
let's leave the birthday girl to herself. We've got lots to do before the party.
this is a pre-birthday gift. Sneaky suspicion you are going to love it.
guys, wait...
this was really great.
thank you.
Hey, just the beginning.
Hi.
Hi.
happy birthday.
that means everything.
okay, we both know how Sutton could be back here any second now.
I'm pretty much ready to go.
are you?
I can't.
I thought I could, but I love these people, Ethan.
I'm going to tell them the truth.
so I thought about it all night, and then again this morning and, however they react - whether it's anger or disappointment, whatever, it... it's my only hope of having a future here.
I'm going to tell them the truth about who I am.
what?
I'm proud of you.
Derek? What are you doing here?
I'm here to win you back.
it's not that easy.
you hurt me. You kind of broke my heart.
I screwed up, I admit that.
I was scared.
scared. Of who?
me, or... maybe Alec?
Sutton came to me with more crazy accusations.
she said she saw you and Alec together at the club, and then, out of the blue, you break up with me.
char, these gentlemen just showed up at the front door.
they said they have some questions for Derek.
Yeah, son. Is that your car out front?
it... It could be. It was an anonymous call.
we need to search the vehicle.
Hey, guys.
Hey. - Hey.
how was your match?
it was brutal. He showed no mercy at all.
Yeah. Win at all costs, right, Dad?
that's your sister, man. Take it easy.
speaking of that, how's our venture capitalist Terry? Any word?
we got a meeting set up with his boss on Monday.
so, meanwhile, I'm just putting the finishing touches on a prospectus.
all right. Well, stay on it.
excuse me a second, guys.
so have you wished Sutton a happy birthday yet?
no, but I will.
Hey, did she seem at all strange to you the other night at dinner?
almost like she was fishing around for something?
Yeah. I noticed that.
what do you got, Dan?
it worked just like you said it would.
they picked up Derek Rogers. He's on his way in.
okay, I'll be right there.
and Dan... - Yes?
good work.
thank you.
Hi! - Hey.
well, aren't we the sweaty one.
Yeah, sorry. Been at it awhile.
Oh, no, it's kind of, um... wow.
the fam's in the big top, decorating for Sutton's birthday party. You should come help.
my mom actually suggested it.
What'd your dad say?
he didn't say anything.
what was he supposed to say?
I don't know.
well, that's a weird look.
what's on your mind, handsome? Spill.
would you hate me if I skipped the party?
no, but I'd be confused.
okay, not exactly an explanation, but I'm not complaing.
just gotta trust me, Laurel.
I'm never gonna let anything come between us.
you're a little low on the right.
I don't want to presume to tell you your business. You're a little low on the right.
perfect! Thanks a lot, fellas.
Hey! I didn't think we were gonna see you till later, kiddo.
your only duty is to show up tonight, and have a great time.
I know. - I know you were expecting to be on the lawn, - but they were predicting rain, so... - Better safe than sorry.
the cake, the cake! No, she can't see the cake!
in the kitchen.
well, now that you're here, you can help.
char's bringing a date, right?
I'm not sure.
I'll go with "Guest" then.
what?
I wanted to tell you something.
it'll be kind of crazy tonight, so I don't know if I'll have the chance.
so these last few weeks have been really great.
how much you've taught me and given me.
okay. - It's not just that.
I have all these new memories like baking cookies and homecoming... boyfriends.
and I know how much you're always there for me.
I always have been and I always will be.
I know that, and I realize how lucky I am.
and how horrible my life might've been if I wasn't here.
and I know you value honesty.
it's really everything, isn't it? I'm with you on this.
these last few weeks, it's like we... we found it again.
I look into your eyes, Sutton, it's the same eyes I looked into when you were two days old - filled with such trust.
we finally got that back and I am so grateful.
this is really hard.
I don't think so. I think the key to love is trust and...
without that, what's left?
sweetie, your long face is killing me.
it is your birthday. Cheer up.
Hey, you mush heads, come on. I think you're jumping the gun.
the party's not till tonight - ooh! Ooh, hey, hey, sweetie.
sweetie, you okay?
I'm fine.
dad, I know... that everything you do, and everything you have done, it's for your family... ...and for your daughters.
I know that.
Whoa! Easy there!
what's up? You're so not supposed to be here yet.
I love you.
okay. Awkward.
I just need to say it before...
before what? The end of the world - is it near?
before things change.
okay, this is freaky.
is this, like, you're pregnant or something? Dying?
just... you are amazing.
okay, that just got frighteningly sincere, which could only mean ulterior motive.
not this time.
okay, well, just in case you had any other ideas,
Sutton Mercer better be at her party tonight.
she will.
guarantee it.
I smell that desert air and I know I'm home.
how 'bout you? Phoenix home for you?
Yeah, it sure is.
actually, I'm home for my birthday.
I couldn't do it.
everything that Kristin just said confirmed the way that she would react.
she's all about trust and-and honesty; two things that I can never have with her.
okay, but you're running out of time.
I'll figure it out.
even if it means coming face-to-face with Sutton.
in fact, maybe that's the key.
I don't know.
what, you think I can't handle her?
she just doesn't always respond well to direct confrontation.
well, I'm not just gonna run away from her.
I want to help you. - I know.
I just, I think this is something I need to do by myself.
where are you going?
to find her before she finds me.
you can't hold him like this. He has rights.
and you're, what, his attorney?
he doesn't have an attorney. Derek doesn't come from money.
these days, who does?
char, enough of this. You're coming home right now.
I'm not going anywhere, Mother.
maybe you should, Char.
Mr. Rybak, I'm here to vouch for Derek. He didn't do anything wrong.
before you go any further, he's being released under his own recognizance.
now, he's still in serious trouble, but if he takes responsibility for his actions, maybe I'll take it easy on him.
you should go home. Phyllis?
shall we?
you go ahead, Mother.
char, this is no... You can't order me around, okay?
you can't control me!
unless you want to drive me away like you did your sister Annie!
I told you I had nothing to do with that.
nothing.
guessing this is about that Derek kid?
no, actually, it's about that name I gave you, that woman Annie Hobbs.
no sign of her yet.
but with just a name and a description to go on, it's not gonna be easy.
well, you keep working on it.
in the meantime... there's something else I need.
Hello?
mother? Dad?
Laurel? Anyone home?
Hello, house!
Hello, ding room.
Hello, ugly painting. I have always hated it.
Hello, fireplace.
Hello, glorious closet!
Hello, my room and my friends...accessories and multi-thread-count sheets! Hello!
Hey, Emma.
and hello, Ethan.
I called. You weren't picking up. Any luck?
no, not really.
I want to be with you for this, all right? I can't just stand here on the sidelines.
well, you're just gonna have to, Ethan.
give me one reason why.
give me a reason why not.
because I love you.
I love you, Emma.
I probably have from the moment I met you.
I wanted to say it today at the country club.
I wanted to say it forever.
and Sutton?
I never loved her. You know that.
Ethan, I,uh... - You don't have to say it.
every time I look at you whenever we're together... it's there.
I need to see you.
I know. Me, too. I want this to be in person.
meet me at the cabin?
we haven't been there since the night that we met.
right. - Okay.
in an hour I'll meet you there.
I love you, Emma.
Hey, there. - Hey.
okay, enough micromanaging for the day. We better get home and change.
plus I think I'm driving everybody crazy.
no different than the nurses at the hospital, I'm sure.
can I ask you something, Daddy?
no, absolutely not.
as my offspring, you're never permitted to ask me a question, so...
what did you say to Justin the other day when you had your little chat?
Why? What'd he say I said?
Hey, I am the one asking the questions here.
okay, if you must know, it was an awkward conversation between a father and the boy who's gotten way too close to his daughter.
and the father showed incredible restraint and modern-day sensitivity and behaved rather admirably, I think.
can we not kid around here?
he's been acting really weird lately.
he even said he might not come to the party tonight.
well, that's ridiculous. Of course he's coming.
he has to come, he's your boyfriend!
he lives above the clubhouse! He has to be come.
can I quote you on that?
no, no, I will deny it.
I love you so much, Daddy.
all right. - Okay, let's go already.
Sutton... look at you!
it's exquisite, if I do say so myself.
it just fits you so beautifully. The shoes, the bow how it...
you don't... have to do that.
I'm... sorry. I was just... going for... mmm, perfection.
like always.
look, thanks, Mother Mom.
I'm gonna make a quick stop, and then I'll see you at the party.
Whoo... very nice.
beautiful. Very nice. - Thank you.
they are gonna be lining up.
I don't know if I'm really ready for that, actually.
right, I'm sorry. I forgot.
so, shall we take one car?
Yeah. Uh, no, actually.
you guys should probably drive yourselves.
you're probably gonna want to stay later than I am, and I still gotta pick up Sutton's gift, so...
What'd you get her?
it wouldn't be a surprise if I told you, now would it?
t... why don't you take the convertible?
be nice to get back into a real car.
especially after that clunker you were driving in L. A.
what kind of a paintless wagon was that?
all right, you look beautiful, honey. - Thanks.
I'll see you at the party. - Okay.
lipstick, and then we can go.
know that look.
Mads, did I ever tell you what I was driving in L. A?
the station wagon?
no, not that I rember.
is it still in L. A?
Yeah. Yeah, it's still there.
you look beautiful.
thank you.
so you're gonna go to the party?
Yes. But I wanted to come here first.
all right, well, I'll come with you.
we can face them together.
do we have to talk about this now?
no.
I want you.
Oh, my God.
right on the first guess!
all it takes is a kiss, right, Emma?
what is wrong with you?!
you set this whole thing up?!
Oh, yeah, that's it, run, Emma.
isn't that what you always do?
run?
all I have done is stay.
stay here, be you.
I wanted to get to you before you got to them!
why is that?
I read the letter to your mother.
Oh, reading other people's mail now!
what is that, like, a federal offense? You're just stacking 'em up!
why won't you listen to her, all right? She did everything for you!
she took your spoiled selfish life and turned it around!
not just with your family, but with Char and Thayer and Mads!
and you.
especially you, right, Ethan?
stop it!
Ethan... she's not gonna listen to you or me.
it's over.
Yeah, hmm, actually, it's not over... Emma.
because when you steal someone else's life, there's always a price.
from the moment you stepped into my shoes, it is always been about making your orphan dreams come true.
what did you think? That you just deserved all of this?
you know, in Vegas I got a chance to walk around in your shoes.
cool place, tons of opportunities, but you just didn't really seem to take advantage because, what, it's just easier to steal my life?
she did not steal your life. You gave it to her!
great, Ethan, blame me for you falling in love with her.
justify cheating by making me the villain.
just tell me, exactly how long have the two of you been sleeping together?
Oh, we didn't have to sleep together to fall in love.
saving it for marriage?
stop it!
all I wanted was for this to be over for us to be sisters, Sutton. Real sisters.
but that was never the idea, was it?
actually... it was... but you screwed it up.
you are a vindictive little bitch.
God, there's that twin thing again.
cause I was just about to call you the same thing.
night, kids.
you're finished here.
Hey, didn't you hear me honking?
Derek's not coming.
he left a message. Something he had to do.
I swear, it had something to do with your dad.
our father tried to help Derek.
the guy's a screw-up, Char.
he's not. He's cute and amazing and... amazing.
and I know I said that twice, but it just shows how deep my feelings are.
but to say that our dad is somehow using Derek...
Mads, it's possible.
there's no way he could have known what car I drove in L. A. unless he'd been there.
we thought that someone had broken in.
okay, so what now? Our dad's a burglar?
look, I'm just thinking out loud.
why don't you think to yourself?
come on. Let's go. We're gonna be late.
I heard a "we" in there.
thought you were alone in L. A. Was there some girl?
Yeah, many, many girls.
are you sure you can dance in those things?
you need to fight! You need to fight this!
Why?
everything Sutton just said was true!
her family, her friends, they will believe her!
I don't stand a chance against her.
Ethan, I'm leaving. I'm gonna go back to Vegas or wherever.
all right, then I'll come with you!
No! - Damn it, Emma!
Ethan, this is over!
how do you not get that?
you have a life here, a brother, a job.
I don't care about any of that! I want you!
it doesn't matter.
I love you!
Ethan, what we had was incredible and magical.
you and me were not meant to happen.
I can't let you just walk out of my life.
okay? I mean it.
I can't let you do this.
I'm doing it.
so, this is either Emma or it's Sutton.
or it's Sutton pretending to be Emma.
or it's Emma pretending to be Sutton.
it's me, goofball; the real Emma.
I know Sutton stayed with you.
Yeah. Look, it thought about calling and warning you, but I kinda figured whatever need to happen should happen.
well, hell hath no fury like a twin scorned.
I'm coming home, Lex.
she's gonna expose me to the family, show that I'm an impostor.
basically, hurt them just to hurt me.
God, that sucks!
I got a pretty good sense of Sutton when she was here, and... I don't know.
I know what you were looking for when you went over there: a sister and a family.
it was just a silly dream.
only if you run away from it.
Lex, I really appreciate the encouragement, but...
look, I just really and truly believe that Sutton is a crazy force of nature.
but I also think that the only way she's gonna accept you is if you stand up to her.
Yeah, I tried that.
got ugly, did it?
way ugly.
well, nothing good ever happens without a fight, right?
Emma, maybe what you're looking for is there, not here.
crazy, look at this place.
poor guy, he doesn't get out much.
love the bracelet.
Oh, thanks. Just a little gift from my squeeze.
Hey, that's between us.
so, why is Sutton not here yet?
always fashionably late.
and look who's obnoxiously early.
I'll take care of this.
this nasty crashing habit really needs to stop.
who says I wasn't invited?
I'd be happy to say it.
well, for your information, Sutton invited me.
called me yesterday and said it was time we all made peace.
she never told me that.
God, I hope that wasn't the reason.
come on, guys. Let's go check out that obscene pile of gifts.
rember last year when she actually registered?
guys, Thayer, Justin, glad you decided to join us.
well, I couldn't let Laurel down, now could I?
Justin, you know, the other day, you said some things...
I want to apologize.
in my life I have trouble finding adults that I can trust as much as my mother and father.
they tend to suspect people of things.
do you suspect me of anything?
no. No, not at all.
Justin, is Dr. Mercer giving you a hard time?
no, ma'am.
and if you guys don't mind, I think that Laurel is looking for me.
I think she is.
you two guys okay?
honestly, I don't know. There's just something strange.
you feel it, too, right?
no. When I look at Justin, I see a boy madly in love with Laurel.
and yes, it scares me, but it's so wonderful to see how happy she is.
we finally have things with dad under control, and you have to start again with all these suspicions.
all dad wants is for us to be together.
just a real family. And honestly, that's all I want to.
okay. Look, it's one thing to want that, and it's another thing to bury your heads in the sand.
I'll be right back.
who are you looking for, Emma or Sutton?
Emma's not coming.
I figured Sutton would already be here.
so you know she's in Phoenix?
we saw her at the cabin.
now I'm pretty sure she's coming here to drop her last bomb.
and I'm assuming you want to stop her.
somebody's got to.
you're here! - Finally!
we were worried. - Happy birthday.
happy birthday. - Thank you.
why are you all wet? Is it raing outside?
Yeah.
you're wearing a different dress, sweetie? Was it 'cause I was fussing too much?
I get it. You don't like it.
no, I loved it. I... it was... the seam had a tear.
excuse me.
there's the birthday girl. Come on, I know it's your birthday, but we got a schedule here - dancing, cake, come on.
wait, are you okay?
Yeah. Just a crazy day.
dad, excuse me. I'm sorry.
it's me. It's me.
you didn't leave?
you were right. I need to stand up for myself.
I don't get it. Why isn't she here? She left before us.
I have no idea where she is.
look, Emma, what you said at the cabin...
do you love me? - You know I do.
then it doesn't matter.
it doesn't matter because whatever happens tonight or tomorrow, or the next day, we will go down fighting.
you and me. Together.
Ethan. I love you.
there you are.
happy birthday.
okay, everybody, where's the birthday girl? - Thank you.
time to dance. - You look beautiful.
and everybody gets a spin with Sutton!
lucky me.
mind if I have the first dance?
Yeah.
you're awful late.
punch?
did you get Sutton's gift?
sure did. It's on the table with the rest of them.
so how long were you in L. A.spying on me?
there is no way you could've known what I was driving.
you got me. I was snooping on Mads' phone.
I saw a picture of you in front of some old clunker, and I just assumed it was yours. Was I wrong?
is everything okay, T?
cause I get the feeling there's something you're not talking to me about.
I'm not... I'm not prying, I'm just... I'm concerned.
I'm sorry.
I just... I guess I just keeping listening to the wrong people.
all right, everyone!
everyone, if I could have your attention, please!
if you could have your attention, please.
here we go!
happy birthday to you
happy birthday to you
happy birthday, dear Sutton
happy birthday to you.
speech!
this has been such an amazing night.
and... now I've gotten what I so desperately wanted, always.
this place and you guys...
it's really been a dream come true.
and now it's time to tell you what I could never tell you before the truth about who I really am.
the truth is...
and that truth is...
I love you.
each and every one.
excuse me.
Sutton, is that you?
Sutton. What are doing out here?
even though they called it "the Wilde estate,
it was pretty peaceful on our first full day there.
keep them quiet. shh.
not so much rattling.
and Steve wanted us to love it.
wake up, Hey, bring the coffee.
but my mom and I were already up.
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.
we had been in town, where she was enrolling me In my new school.
cool. - When they open the door,
I want them to see the ham.
Steve. - Oh, Emmy. You're up.
Hi. Hey, guys, Emmy's up.
no need to be quiet anymore.
what is all of this?
well, I just wanted to welcome you - To your beautiful, new, serene- - Oh, god!
ham!
Lunt! - My bad!
Steve, this is all very sweet.
but you know that there are only two of us, right,
and one of us is 12?
which is why we have the 12-and-under waffle trolley,
for which you just barely qualify.
there's a waffle trolley?
there's a waffle trolley.
look, the child is starving.
Yes, she is.
we walked five miles because I couldn't find my car.
that's because it's gone, and in its place...
a new car.
my car is gone?
don't worry. I recycled.
and the metal cube it was crushed into Is now a coffee table.
where is that new car?
man, is that quiet.
Migo, where's the car?
this is it, boss. It's a volt.
I thought she'd like it because it's electric!
and plus, it's very sporty, no?
I said to get a real car,
not some giant electric toy car.
I'm sorry, we'll get you a real one.
puddle, you can have this thing.
Yay!
no, Steve, she can't have a car. She's 12.
boo. - Don't complain.
it got you into the waffle trolley.
and, Steve, you can't go around Giving me huge gifts like-- So, really, you just plug it in?
is that how that works? - You can plug it Into a household
this is a three-hour charge. - It's the wave of the future.
no, no, no, Steve, wait, listen.
I appreciate everything you're doing here.
it is--it's thoughtful. It's generous.
well, it was until Mr. Fat fingers Couldn't hold on to a ham long enough To get it up into a tree.
Steve, it's an eight-pound ham!
you'll throw out your back!
ham!
Oh, great, it's my one nice shirt.
Yeah, yeah.
it's your one nice-- Really nice shirt.
Oh, it's not my only shirt.
the rest of my clothes are in the backseat of my
Oh. You need new clothes?
well, now that we've had a delicious breakfast,
and it's time to get dressed for the day,
I thought that we should review some new options.
now, remember, these are sized For the models.
so we'll obviously alter them For your particular needs.
I know it's kind of lame,
but we couldn't get any actual models To get up this early.
I'm going to assume this was very well-intentioned,
but this is exactly The kind of thing
I don't want my daughter exposed to
fashion and pop culture and women being objectified.
Oh, well, after dolores,
the next few aren't technically women.
don't worry. The outfits will work on you.
of course, you'd look good in anything.
heck, you'd look good in nothing.
Steve, the fact that you think I'd want a fashion show
points out how very little you know about-- Now that is cute.
Yeah, picture it without the kitchen gloves.
no, that's what makes it fun.
right?
no, what am I doing?
what is this doing to puddle?
you know what? She's a great kid,
and she's not used to all of this opulence.
she is very happy with very little.
I had to do something, or I'd seen my last waffle.
he doesn't know any better, mom.
I don't.
he wants to change... - I do.
but just doesn't know how. - I don't.
I'm not worried About Steve, okay?
I'm worried about you.
me? - Her?
me? I'm fine.
I don't care about this stuff.
steve could give those clothes To the homeless or something, right?
sure. Look, Emmy, I'm not saying that my life works.
it doesn't, but I want it to.
I think that there's a real opportunity here for both of us.
and I want to use it.
I don't want to end up Some shallow cad who just uses lame lines On women like
you didn't think it was sexy When I said that you'd look good in nothing?
Oh, that was supposed to be sexy.
okay, you're right.
I mean, I moved in here because you asked me
to help you become a better person,
to lead a more responsible life.
and if you're serious...
I am.
then I guess now is as good time as any to start.
you know what we could do?
we could take all of that breakfast food,
we could go down to the shelter, and we could feed everybody.
Yeah. I don't care about fancy waffles.
or ten different kinds of syrups.
there were syrups?
you didn't try the s-- migo!
Yeah, boss.
can you get that waffle trolley Back in here, please?
on it.
drama NameSeason X Episode X
steve set to work To show my mother he could be the man She wanted him to be.
you're disappointed.
Oh, please.
I can wear escada anytime.
I'm more worried about you.
every time you try To have any kind of fun,
that woman is just going to tinkle all over
Hey, Hey, Hey, - Well, she's plain as Maine,
and you were only trying to help.
Hey, he's overreacting, right?
I mean, change can be good.
maybe I do need to change.
Oh, you definitely need to change.
your life has very little purpose.
I just don't think you're going to succeed.
Hey, my life has a purpose.
it's winning over Emmy.
I mean, let's face it,
I've spent a lot of time as a playboy partyer.
I don't remember one truly happy moment.
that doesn't mean he didn't have them.
he's got a sword!
you know, I'm actually looking forward To living with less.
so I should cancel The big, giant party this weekend?
well, no, obviously we can't do that,
not with fa'ad living next door.
steve and fa'ad had always competed Over who threw the best parties.
it started when fa'ad wanted to throw a party But had nothing to celebrate.
so Steve threw an even more pointless one
about the onset of daylight standard time.
fa'ad countered with a daylight savings party.
and finally,
steve threw a party That celebrated having nothing to celebrate.
no, the "unnecessoiree" has become the most meaningful Meaningless party of the year.
of course. It's the deepest shallow thing you do.
but it's just going to prove to Emmy that you can't change.
well, what am I supposed to do? I can't cancel it, especially since fa'ad Has started throwing his party on the same night.
Yeah, fa'ad figured, "what could be more unnecessary - Than another 'unnecessoiree' on the same night?" - ah!
so if fa'ad finds out that I'm canceling my party, - He will swoop in on my guest list like-- - like one of my falcons? Ka-ah!
does anybody have a dead mouse on them, by any chance?
no matter.
so sorry to overhear That your party won't be happening, Steve.
but, uh, I have to admit,
I assumed as much
what, with that family of environmentalists
living in your tree house like so many falcons. Ka-ah!
Ugh. Ever since they found that ham,
they've been un-trainable.
in an event,
I want you to know That you're welcome to be a guest at my, I suppose,
now slightly more necessary "unnecessoiree.
I have a very large property.
Emmy never needs to know.
and I'm sure the woman goes to sleep at the crack of 10: 00,
which means that she'll be long gone By the time my first guest arrives.
no, no. My party will be a huge, happy success.
yes...
unless one of us was unlucky enough to say something stupid.
Yes, but something stupid Is the last thing either of us would say.
and you'll never tell Emmy.
Yes. Of course...
the last thing you said was, "you'll never tell Emmy.
so here's hoping that's not the stupid last thing.
don't, okay?
don't tell Emmy about my party.
may god tear my eyes out if I do.
wait, don't you mean Allah?
whatever. A-ha!
in the jungle,
we would've called this "ata oka," or bad omen,
but Steve just went back to thinking About where to put the party tent.
steve set to work On what he was hoping would be a secret party.
what are these tents for?
well, I guess I can tell you.
kind of throwing a big party.
but, Steve, you said you'd be less extravagant.
go buy these giant tents?
Oh, no. I didn't buy them.
they come free with Whitney Houston.
by the way, I'm gonna need help lying to your mom.
you know how I'm not really very good at lying to your mom.
it's gonna get pretty intense.
what's gonna be intense?
Whitney Houston and the V. I.P. Room.
man, do you get up early.
you're having a party, And, what, you were going to try to keep it from me?
no. I just know how much you don't like "fun.
I like fun.
no, I'm just talking about how you're "not fun.
I am fun.
stop doing the quotes. God, I'm fun.
I hate it when people say I'm not fun, because I am fun.
remember those parties I used to throw In the tree house in high school?
that was fun.
those were parties?
we just have a different definition. - You know what? Listen
I was a kid.
you can't expect a kid to have fun.
this is the woman who's raising me.
anyway, I was a little 15-year-old nerd.
I am not the same person today.
and I'm not the same Super-cool, rocking-it-out, Party--oh,
I guess I still kind of am.
look, you're gonna hate this party, okay?
there's just way too much excess and waste.
I'll just cancel it.
don't cancel it.
just do it without all the excess and waste.
well, those two things-- they're kind of Like the backbone of the "unnecessoiree.
you can help him, right, mom?
that was my first mistake.
if he wants me to, sure.
of course he does, right, Steve?
this was my second mistake.
sure. Yeah.
I just want the people wasted, not the food.
you can have a very fun party without everyone getting wasted.
that's like your joke about your one nice shirt...
that turned out not to be a joke.
here's what we do-- we take what you already have.
we just scale it down.
great. Yes. I love that. We scale it down.
so this is what we have so far.
obviously we can just add anything to it as we go.
just keep looking.
Steve, add anything to it?
I mean, this is a bowl of cristal.
isn't that kind of pricey?
it is,
which is why I didn't want to fill the actual pool with it
three days before the party-- that would be wasteful.
see, your mom's having a positive effect on me already.
this is supposed to be the actual pool?
no, no, I scaled it down, like you asked me to.
can I play with one With one of your dolls?
Oh, no, no, no, Those aren't gonna be dolls.
believe me, after the party,
you're not gonna want to go anywhere near her.
here's what I'm thinking, - a lot of this already feels Too big. - Small.
it's big. - It's small.
and it's big. - It's very small.
it's big. - Small.
small? - Big.
impersonal.
it is big.
I'll tell you what we do.
we do the shopping ourselves.
okay, great.
we find a discount store. - If they even have them.
we buy in bulk. We get everybody's favorite stuff.
let's do this. - Let's do it.
okay. - Okay.
my god, discount stores?
why don't we just slather everything and everyone In mayonnaise?
do you think she'd go for that?
Yeah, that sounds great.
now we're having a party!
I'd never seen anything Like the place we went to.
I think we were all a little overwhelmed.
Oh, my god.
this place is as big as a village. - House.
this is so cool.
can I get one of these?
Yeah, I don't think you can get one of anything in this place.
check it out. They got a five-gallon vat of mustard here That costs as much as those little packets Migo used to get me from Yankee stadium.
like horses.
okay, Steve, look, focus,
we're here for the party.
now, I say we do swizzlers,
because they're cheap, and everybody loves them.
so we've taken care of that.
wait, no, no, that's it?
no, I think my friends are going to expect A little bit more than that.
no, if people aren't going to be loosened up,
how can we have the couple that has the one big fight
and then makes a big scene at the end of the party? I mean, that's-- don't you think that-- We both think that's fun, right?
Yeah. But if I would've known that,
I would've made some Of my famous Amazonian jungle hooch.
don't have the right worms.
you know what? They have a whole wall of champagne.
and I'm sure it's fairly priced.
well, that's a great call.
Yes, let's get a wall full of champagne.
I was thinking, like, one or two bottles.
I was afraid that that's what you're thinking.
okay, I'm a little worried that we're kind of going-- What's the word?
- "underboard" with this thing.
I mean, we want people to have fun at the party, right?
okay, I get it.
you don't think I'm fun.
and you know what? I might not be fun.
so why don't you do the party the way you want it,
and I will get off your back?
no, no, no, I want you on my back.
heck, I want you on your back.
no, what I'm saying is the swizzlers are great.
let's get some mustard.
how about a pallet of chips?
don't give me that look, migo.
he asked me to do this.
I know, but a man can only change so much.
and, yes, I overcharged him for a thing or two.
but I care about him,
and I don't want to see anybody get hurt, that's all.
are you kidding me?
these chips are a dollar a bag!
God, you're going to ruin everything!
well, I'm a little worried for your party, my friend.
if this is the best that you can do,
I worry that the reputations
Oh, I don't have the energy for this charade.
it's brilliant.
it'll make my party seem As worthless as one of your American college degrees.
I'm actually quite optimistic about my party.
I think that-- oh, I don't have the energy For this charade.
my party's gonna be worse Than your dumpster full of stillborn foals.
stillborn foa-- Oh, I don't have the energy for this charade.
Hey, does it seem like we're unusually tired today?
it has come up a lot.
nevertheless, You've painted a forest red, and you're bringing in A huge wild animal death chamber of some sort.
that's not a forest.
it's just a plastic drum Filled with something so inexpensive,
it can't even call itself licorice.
there's a step below licorice? - Apparently.
well, why not build it into a forest?
it's not a forest.
it's--it's not a scale model.
this is the sum total of the extravagance of my party.
but what of the giant cocaine-covered orgy dome?
that is something Called the "hostess snowball.
so the hostess goes in there and-- - It's not a place.
none of this is a place.
it's just--it's just food.
Steve, Steve! Steve! you're ruining it! - It's food!
you're ruining the world! - No, it's just food!
no, not the orgy dome! - No, it's pennies!
it doesn't matter!
well, if it is pennies,
then what about the giant dirigible head of
Oh, my, is that me?
that's a balloon from a child's movie, you fool.
you can get a trillion of them for a dime at this garbage store That Emmy took me to.
well, I wanted your party to fail,
but not so badly that nobody would come To one of our parties ever again.
Steve, you have to cancel this party.
what? No, you can't.
Steve, my mom finally thinks you can change.
Oh, I can change.
I can change everything on this table Into so much...
I can change everything on this table Into so much...
why are we so tired? - I don't know.
perhaps it was your trip to the store.
Yes, and all your recent hawk attacks.
Steve, you can't give up on it now.
you were the guy that was able to get People to celebrate having nothing to celebrate.
why don't you try to convince people that it's fun...
to not have fun.
Yes.
what the child seems to be saying
is that even though the food at the party might be awful...
the irony will be so delicious That the party will be a huge success.
now I'm getting worried that I may be going overboard
with my giant walk-in snowball And team of snowball hostesses.
you already stole that idea?
I texted my guy as soon as I saw it.
but now I'm thinking Perhaps I'll just serve a bowl of raisinets.
ha ha! - No.
don't, okay?
I'm really starting to like my party theme.
please don't steal it.
I won't.
and so everything was set.
steve was going to have the most necessary Unnecessary party
that anyone's ever had fun not having fun at.
I am going to serve raisinets. Ha ha! Aah!
hawk attack.
on the night of the party,
steve was finding out that convincing people
not having fun is not only ironic, but fun,
was ironically not fun.
what's with this party?
steve usually has the best of everything.
do you get it?
irony. Do you get it?
serving the worst of the best.
do you get it?
Oh, oh! - Do you get it?
so how's it going?
I think they're getting it.
I don't know.
that's the thing about irony.
it can be so...
subtle.
but she can't know.
great. - Great.
great party. - Really great.
great. Great.
the only thing your friends are not getting into Is the nonalcoholic beer.
that's 'cause so few of us are nonalcoholics.
Hey, you know what? Since we're having so much fun,
what do you say we crank it up a notch?
what do you mean?
I could still hire a band or Whitney Houston.
that won't be excessive.
she'll never deliver.
or we could get Jake busey to drive your volt Into the pool or something.
I think Jake lives upstairs.
I actually think we've had enough fun.
I think it's about time to put the icing on the cake.
Oh, good, so that's not the icing that we're using
my slideshow.
and that. Yes.
and don't you think it would be better
to start with the funny cake instead of the funny slideshow?
funny? Oh, no, no, It's not funny.
it's about my life in the Amazon-- The hardships, the struggles of the people.
let's put some meat on this bone.
irony is I've been trying to do that Since the day you got here.
Hello, Steven.
how are you finding your party?
because I can't. I shouldn't joke.
