the moon is bright. Oh yes, it is bright.
the moon is brighter than ever.
my wretched moon is bright. The reflection from Chunhyang's room is bright.
when was young l was known as " Bright Moon " of Namwon,
Wolmae Wolmae but am bright no more as my face grew old.
as one day, two days and several days pass, the young lovers' shyness disappears, and they grow fondly intimate. One day, as they hug and roll around, they enJoy the 'Love Song.'
come here, ride my back and we'll play. Come here, ride my back and we'll play.
love, love, love, my love. What a love, my beloved.
yes... my love. Oh... my love.
what would you like to eat? What would you like to eat?
a poked round watermelon poured with sweet white honey.
take the seeds out and taste a Juicy red piece. Savor it all in one big bite.
no don't want any.
then what would you like to eat? What would you like to eat?
a short, thick, and oval sweet cucumber, eggplant, or melon?
no don't want any.
then what would you like to eat? What do you like to eat?
would you like cherries or grapes? A taffy or tangerine candy my dear?
then my love...
what would you like to eat? What do you want to eat?
should Master Lee eat a sour apricot?
no don't want any. Oh, my love.
how did they find out? Who's the bastard that told them?
when the morning cock cried ! e governor suddenly came and demanded your whereabouts
forgive me had no choice.
since your father knows already don't try to lie to him.
tell him you won't leave anymore and you'll concentrate on the exam.
my love, my treasure, my Joy.
Oh yes... you're my beloved.
when you die, become a flower.
a peach flower that blossoms in the spring.
when die l'll become a tiger butterfly.
on a beautiful spring day, if dance around you, then recognize it is me.
lf the flower withers the butterflies don't visit anymore
seek for Butterfly, Bird, and Flower
so don't want to be a flower.
then there's another after you die.
you become the Bell of Chongno, and l'll be the hammer that hits it.
ln the night, l'll hit it 28 times, ln the day, l'll hit it 33 times.
when hit you, recognize it is me.
don't want to be a bell.
then there's another after you die.
you'll be the Yin, such as the 'earth', 'shade,' 'wife', and 'woman'.
l'll be the Yang, such as the 'sky', 'sun', 'light', husband', and 'man'.
son' become a word 'woman' and 'like'
we will live happily forever when we become 'one'.
hey Hyangdan. - Oh my gosh! You're bad.
master Lee.
master Lee!
what are you doing here?
the governor is looking for you. You have to go.
what for?
everybody is saying something good has happened.
where have you been lately?
were you too busy to study and hear the good news?
what sort of news father?
l've been appointed to the King's cabinet.
l'll finish up here so take your mother to Seoul ahead of me.
master Lee is here.
my son-in-law is home!
but why are you here so early?
well, l'm glad.
l Just sowed an autumn Jacket for you.
come up and try it on.
why did you walk here without PangJa?
why do you look so worried?
did your father scold you? Please say something.
l don't smell any alcohol.
... no fever.
what's wrong?
my father has been appointed as a minister in Seoul.
what great news.
that's a high rank in the government. But why aren't you happy?
l have to leave for Seoul tomorrow.
are you worried won't follow you?
a woman follows her husband wherever he goes.
there's nothing in Namwon if you're away.
my mother said if people discover our marriage, l'll be disowned and forbidden to take the state exam.
so she insists don't mention our marriage to my father.
are you saying we must separate?
only for a little while. All can do is come back for you later.
Oh my husband!
ls what you said a quirk, a Joke, a mistake, or nonsense?
watching me kill myself...
ls that what you want?
when we met the first time, what did you say?
we swore to the mountains and the ocean with the sun and the moon as our witnesses...
until the mulberry field becomes the sea or the sea becomes the mulberry field, we will never part.
not even a year has past, and you're saying farewell?
there is the cloud you swore on.
speak to me. Speak to me.
you begged me to be your wife, but now you ruined my life!
lt's Just a small quarrel. Go back to your work.
master Lee is going to Seoul.
what?
Oh, my god! This isn't happening! This is going to kill us all.
all of us is going to have to kill ourselves!
go kill yourself! He might take your body with him.
what did always tell you?
l always told you to meet some one in your own league l told you that would make us both happy.
you were so arrogant and different. This is what you get.
mater Lee! Look at me and talk.
was my daughter ugly or bad-mouthed, or vulgar?
what is the reason for your departure?
you can't do that to us. You can't betray us like this.
lf you still want to go then you're going to have kill us all.
you're going to have to bury us first or we won't let you go.
mother, l'm taking Chunhyang. l have an idea.
there will be a palanquin for the spirit tablet. l'll hide the tablet in my sleeve.
and Chunhyang can hide in the palanquin.
no one will suspect that Chunhyang is in there.
what the hell are you talking about?
how can Chunhyang fit into that small palanquin?
mother, he's frustrated, too. Please, leave me and him.
since Master Lee has to leave tomorrow l want to talk to him and cry on his shoulder all night long.
how can your heart be so benign?
my husband, take this drink. While you travel to Seoul, think of my love for you when you see the blue river.
our enemy is not a person the enemy is the class that divides us.
Chunhyang, take this mirror.
my love is as pure as the mirror's reflection. Cherish it and think of me when you use it.
take this, my husband.
my unchangeable love is the same as the color of a Jade.
think of me when you see it.
after Namwon there's Osu and lmsil, and then ChunJu which is famous for its fans.
after Yusan, which is known for its fur and leather, there's fine honey and ginseng in KongJu.
then there's Chunan, which is famous for its carps.
then Suwon and Kwachon which is 32 km from Seoul.
bandits in Seoul are so territorial, country people start to shiver when they pass Kwachon.
Chunhyang... When pass the exam, l'll send a royal palanquin for you. So wait until that day.
a royal palanquin is only ridden by high- ranking officials.
do you think this day will come before become an old hag?
when you get there, write to me and let me know how you are.
don't worry. No matter how far l am from you, l'll keep in touch.
ln a legend, Seo Hwangmo in YoJi pond sent a blue bird thousands of miles to deliver her letters.
l don't have the blue bird, but there will be someone to take my letters to you.
meanwhile his mother prepares to leave.
double palanquins...
single palanquins...
horses and soldiers are busy.
nervous PangJa dashes with Mongryong's horse.
ring... ring... ring... ring...
he arrives at Chunhyang's home.
master Lee there's big trouble!
master Lee! Master Lee! There's big trouble!
your mother asked about you, and gave her an excuse. We must hurry.
Mongryong has no choice, but to mount the horse's back.
farewell Chunhyang.
farewell mother-in-law.
farewell Hyangdan.
Chunhyang is speechless.
on barefoot, runs, runs, runs...
she grabs the bridle with one hand, and with the other, she grabs Mongryong's leg.
Oh my husband!
Oh my husband, please take me!
PangJa pulls the bridle, and whips the horse.
lt bolts like a flying tiger.
green mountains and blue rivers he passes it one by one.
like the mandarin duck that lost her lover,
Chunhyang is heart- broken.
as she sees her husband leave, she sees this much of him and that much of him, like a distant moon, like a distant star, and then like a butterfly...
l long to go. long to go.
l long to follow my lover, for one thousand miles, for even ten thousand miles.
where the wind rests, where the clouds rest, where all animals rest, even a wild falcon, where they all rest at Dongsul's high ridge.
but will cross it over to follow my love.
the Jiknya star in the heavens, even when the Milky Way blocks it, the Gyunwoo star can always see it once a year.
the place where my beloved stays, what milky way is blocking him, that makes me see him no more?
l want to die, and become a spring swallow, so can fly above my beloved's roof and build my nest under the eaves.
l'll meet him in the middle of the night, and make love to him till dawn.
while she sobbed every night, the next governor moved on to NaJu city after three years.
so Governor Byun from Seoul takes his place.
the new governor is on his way.
the new governor is on his way.
he rides in a luxurious palanquin, with screens raised like a bird's wings.
lugged horses follow the palanquin.
two tall officials with a daunting mien guard the palanquin.
out of the South Gate of Seoul he looked around the scenery.
beds of blooming flowers, birds singing the willows are green.
he crossed Han River and passed through Sungbang Field,
climbed over Mamtae Ridge and had lunch in Kwachon Town.
after Chungchung Province he arrived at Cholla Province, and paid his bids to his lord. The next day when he departed, he slept in lmshil Town.
at Ohri Gate, all the Six Chief Officials wait to greet him.
the Chief Administrator, f of the Census, the Chief Librarian, who's good at fortune- te the Military Chief, Astrology Chief and the Servants Chief.
they announce his arrival and he enters with an arrogant air.
scores of soldiers and officers stand in a row.
fifty servants bow to the governor.
sixty soldiers bow in two rows, shouting like wild geese.
and thirty courtesans bow in pairs.
stand in a row by twos
governor have an appeal!
l'm distressed! l'm still being taxed for my dead son!
crazy fool.
you idiot! You failed your duties!
as chief of your convoy, please forgive me governor for that sudden disruption.
chief Penal Official! - Yes, governor.
flog this fool ten times!
a new governor usually decrees the penalty and not overdo it. But he goes wild on his first day.
he's trying to show us he's the boss. We'll see about that, right?
when he leaves he'll realize he's Just a flee.
listen to this. He demanded to see the courtesans first before us.
that's unheard of...
yes am present.
like the brightest lunar night in August... Miss Autumn Moon!
yes am present.
governor. This girl has an exquisite style when she does the drum dance.
like the sweet sounds of a paulownia harp... Miss Sweet Harp!
yes am present.
she's the best harp player in Namwon.
like her favorite Moonlight on Namwon temple... Miss Love Moon!
she is a great poet and great performer
like a Milky Way in a legend of crow and magpie bridge... Miss Blooming Light
yes am present.
be it song or dance she's good at everything.
look here! You're calling them too slowly.
call them all at once.
miss String Sound! - Yes - Miss Pine Fidelity! Miss Deep Cloud! - Yes
miss Happy Moon! Miss Precious Orchid! Miss Sweet Lotus! Miss Heartful Ballad
hurry up! Hurry up!
miss Traveling Scent! - Yes am present.
miss Spring Morning!
that's all the courtesans on the register, governor.
look here Census Chief. - Yes, sir.
l've heard a pretty courtesan named Chunhyang lives here. Why isn't she here?
well, she is... sort of...
since ordered all the courtesans to appear how dare she not present herself today!
l'm humble to say it but about Chunhyang
she's actually the daughter of a courtesan and noble official. And heard she's married to the ex- governor's son.
so then... Did he take her to Seoul?
that is... she's keeping her chastity for her husband.
chastity?
a courtesan's daughter... The nobles would die of laughter if they heard this.
Hey, Chief Penal Official! - Yes, sir.
bring her to me now!
the soldiers are on their way.
away the soldiers go.
wearing animal fur hats threaded with dark blue silk, it displays " fast " and they take fast strides.
she's caught! Who is caught? Who is caught?
Chunhyang is caught!
Oh yes! The bitch will pay!
so proud for marrying a noble, she hissed at us, and turned away.
for she's too arrogant, this is good, yes so good.
they follow their order and...
their hats are pulled up and...
they take faster strides and...
they arrive in the forest and...
Chunhyang! Come out
madam, two soldiers are looking for Chunhyang.
Oh no forgot about the courtesan roll call...
welcome. Please, come in.
lt's been a long time.
the new governor demands to see Chunhyang.
since haven't kept my promise to buy you a drink, were you disappointed?
lt would be a lie if wasn't.
l'm sorry was so busy...
Chunhyang, come out!
we're good friends so don't let it get to you, okay?
please have a drink later.
stop it.
hey Kim! We scored.
Chunhyang. When the new governor headed west Pyongyang for two years, he awarded his courtesans a lot of money.
also, as the Governor of Unsan he gave his courtesans much more.
so be nice to him, okay?
Chunhyang. We'll take care of you so don't worry and come with us.
look after her, okay?
Chunhyang has arrived!
Chunhyang is here, my lord.
you're very pretty. Yes, indeed.
l chose Namwon among many other places to see you for myself.
but... Are you really married to the old governor's son?
Yes, sir.
but how can a young woman like you be alone? You must have another man who cares for you?
please tell me.
because l'm married to the old governor's son, l'm devoted to no other man except for my husband.
you're well-intended. But he'll probably marry a noble girl when he passes the exam.
and he'll forget all about you.
you will serve me from now on. So go clean yourself up and wait for me.
l'm not listed as a courtesan and lived my life as a fair lady.
that gives you no reason to do as you please.
by law and custom it's natural to serve your new governor.
stop your nonsense and get ready for him.
lf my husband never returns, l'll be chaste until die. So please reconsider.
a chaste courtesan's daughter is ridiculous.
my mother would faint if she heard this.
be it your mother or l, fidelity is the same. But does class make us different?
what?
a governor is loyal to one king. A wife is loyal to one husband.
but would you fall on your knees and serve two kings, governor?
how dare you! You will die for that! Drag her outside!
we've got her outside my lord!
lf your mother is a courtesan then you're a courtesan by law.
as a lowly courtesan you disobeyed my orders.
so you deserve to die!
did steal food?
did disobey my mother or cheat my fellow brethren?
lf not, then why are you punishing me?
you must be ignorant of our laws.
then tell me what law l've broken.
chief Penal Official! - Yes, sir.
tell her every sin she's committed.
Yes, sir.
listen carefully.
one who commits high treason,
hold on, Pablo, honey. Don't die now.
you're with me, Pablo. Nobody's gonna hurt you.
you're gonna be OK.
please, Pablo.
there's internal hemorrhaging. Notify the ER!
let us take care of everything.
he's going to the ER.
he's here!
what are you doing?
let go! He's going to kill my brother!
Pablo!
Pablo!
let me go, shit! Pablo! He'll kill my brother!
please, Pablo, please.
what?
we just got in. You have to come here and read the will.
buenos AIRES AUGUST 12, 2001
I will not take a plane and fly another 2, 000 miles!
it's your job as a lawyer...
I don't have time to argue.
talk to whoever you have to talk to.
if you don't have an office in Buenos Aires, that's your problem.
Yes, sure.
goodbye.
weren't you a little rude? - No.
give them an inch and they'll take a yard, and the rest...
hello. - Hello.
we're Gabriel de Luca's children.
Pablo and Malena.
I'm Daniel Lerhmann.
the last time I saw you two Pablo was barely 2 weeks old and this small.
Malena...
always so serious and so quiet.
now she can't keep her mouth shut.
where can we talk? We're in a hurry and wanted to sign the papers ASAP and ask if he could be cremated here.
of course, of course.
please come with me.
there he is.
you said over the phone we'd only have to sign papers, not see him.
sorry.
I assumed you'd want to see your father before you made any decisions.
can't we just sign the papers?
hold on, Malena. Hold on.
is he suffering?
his brain is no longer functioning.
that machine's maintaining his vital signs but...
he's clinically dead.
would you come with me for a moment, please?
will one signature do?
I know Pablo and I can imagine what's coming.
please, if you don't mind...
sorry.
if you decide you don't want the machine connected any longer, we'll need at least two signatures.
look, I know how this sounds, but Pablo didn't know my father.
I understand he might. But, I'm not interested...
I just came here to sign and pick up his will.
yes?
mom. Everything's fine.
pablo's fine.
remember it was Pablo who wanted to come, not me.
come home?
how? Do I just grab Pablo and stick him on the plane?
mom, please! We'll see the will and that'll be it.
holy BIBLE
dad.
it's your son, Pablo.
squeeze my hand if you want to say something.
even if it's just a little.
are you all right?
fine. Fucking great... fucking great.
how long have you known him?
my whole life.
we did the medical internship together at the hospital in Tierra del Fuego.
I remember the day when he came here.
he'd known about the tumor for a month and hadn't said a word to anybody.
the jerk drove 2, 000 miles.
72 years old with a brain tumor.
when he got here, he parked his car, came up here all on his own, sat down on this bed...
and when he saw me he said, "Buddy...
it beat me.
take care of me.
listen, Pablo.
this isn't your father.
your father died some time ago.
you have to remember the good things about him...
with this.
this is your father.
Pablo, where are you going?
what did I just say? We'll have to sort out the papers.
shit, Malena!
nice, huh?
what is this supposed to be? - Get in.
come on, Malena. Get in.
smell it?
smell what?
this car smells of Dad.
and look...
Pablo...
you have to sign here.
look at the photo, please.
how can someone screw you up even after he's dead?
I was born 2 weeks early.
mom said I wouldn't keep still.
I was born in that house.
I want to go there.
that's not a good idea.
it's a great idea.
we'll take this car and go south. What's 2, 000 miles?
we could do it in 2 days. - There's no time.
when did we last see each other?
like brother and sister? - Don't be a pain. No.
I know that if you could you would disconnect that machine yourself...
but you know what?
they need two signatures and I won't disconnect my dad until I know more about him.
I want more than one photo.
take it or leave it.
okay, we'll go wherever you want. But just sign first.
no, we go and then I sign.
if you're going to be an asshole, we'll forget about the signature, the will...and just go home.
I'll sign.
don't you feel like shit?
I can't start this trip feeling like this.
we'll have a great time.
a fucking great time, you'll see.
are you going to be in a bad mood the whole trip?
that fucking civil servant.
you've been arguing with her on the phone all day.
she won't send the birth certificate?
well, let's go get it. The attorney won't move a finger?
we go there and show them what a hot attorney you are!
clerk. - Okay, clerk.
but a real hot clerk!
Pablo!
what a hotel you've chosen! I'll choose the next.
the APPEARED
keep a lookout.
hello.
lost something?
I'll give you a hand.
what are you reading?
I don't know... This is weird.
I think it's called a book.
ha, ha. You bust me up.
hotel ATLANTIDA ROOM 206
we should figure out where we're sleeping tonight?
see?
I told you it was this way. - Where have you brought me?
to an authentic place.
I bet it's cheap too.
Hi. - Hi.
I want a double room.
double room with a bathroom is 80 pesos.
if you pay cash, you get a 10% discount and a musical key ring.
okay. - Okay?
we've run out of Gardel's, we only have this one with the national anthem.
don't tire yourself out.
which room did you get?
what does it matter? Just one.
room 207? No. We want another.
I'm tired and I want to take a shower. What does it matter?
it does matter. Excuse me.
can you change it?
I'm going up. You do what you like.
pinochet ARRIVED lN CHILE...
that's the way!
after all we deserve those assholes.
mom called. I don't feel like calling back.
why didn't Mom want me to come?
why do you say that?
she may not have been too happy but... - Please!
she almost laid down on the runway to stop the plane.
why does she never speak of Dad?
why do you think?
you think it's easy to emigrate with a little girl and a newborn baby?
just like that.
people don't do things like that.
just stop and think.
did Dad used to hit you or something?
I wish he had. Then I'd have a reason to hate him.
I used to think he hit her, that he was a bastard.
but no...
he never did anything to her.
I don't know...
I guess they stopped loving each other, so they split up.
dad was always at the hospital, working.
I thought...
I'd disappointed him some way, that he was mad at me. I was only 7 years old, damn it!
so I tried to be Little Miss Perfect.
but he never said a thing.
well, yes...
once...
I asked him what I'd done wrong and he said I hadn't done anything wrong.
he just said...
what you did wrong was not being born a boy.
a boy.
he wanted a son.
so that's why girls turn you on.
screw you!
Malena. Listen.
you know what happened here 20 years ago? - No.
on July 23, 1980, someone was murdered in the room next door.
scary, huh?
Pablo, don't start!
the rooms must all be the same.
there was a couple with a little girl.
at 3 AM a man breaks in.
he has an iron bar and a cattle prod.
know what that is?
they still use them here to electrocute cattle.
220 volts to stun them, then they finish them off.
enough already! Okay?
the first to wake up is the mother.
the guy hits her with the bar, the girl starts crying.
the father gets up to fight but...
the guy stuns him with the cattle prod.
listen to this part.
"3: 27 AM."
the son of a bitch wrote it down minute by minute!
shocks should always be applied to the nerve centers.
in this case the victim receives a strong discharge to the neck which produces a double effect:
the trachea contracts, impeding oxygen intake, and the vertebral column is numbed, clearly limiting his chances of escape.
shit!
so the guy drags the father to the bathtub and drowns him.
l hold his head under the water and feel the veins in his neck bursting.
his lungs contract fighting for air. Incredible how stubborn the human body can be when it comes to survival.
are you okay?
where did you get that?
it's just a joke. It's nothing.
what the hell is this?
where did you get that book?
you'd rather not know. Never mind.
I knew you wouldn't like it. - Give me that.
I'm going to get some supper. You relax.
give it to me. I don't want to get angry.
Pablo.
Malena.
I told you I threw it away, okay?
shit.
I didn't know you'd get like that, I'm sorry.
look...
the killer kills her friend, her boyfriend, her mother and the dog. Look at her. There she is.
the last thing I'd do is run around showing my tits.
and they're small too.
it's always the same in horror films.
the girl never has big tits.
if they have big tits, that's all you look at.
so it's goodbye story.
and with a remote control you can rewind it.
Oh, Pablo, you couldn't be dumber even if you tried.
I do try. I have for years.
I'm glad you're here.
I know I say silly things...
but it's because I'm glad to see you.
and I love you and all that.
I love you too.
great.
Pablo.
Pablo.
wake up. There's someone...
what, Malena? - There.
there's someone there.
what the hell do you mean?
listen.
call reception.
don't hurt my dad!
did you talk to anyone?
a girl. There's a girl.
nothing will happen to her.
she'll get away.
what are you saying? - I don't know, Malena...
just like it said in the book.
what book?
look, what's happening is that there's some son-of-a-bitch in that room...
I don't know what's going on, but I don't give a shit.
let's go.
shit, I forgot something!
I'll be right back.
so you'd thrown it away?
leave it, Malena. I don't feel like arguing now.
what are you up to?
so you want to argue now, do you?
what's your problem with the book if it's all lies.
so what happened there?
I don't know.
what happened to the mother and daughter?
you read that thing. What happened to them?
I don't know.
they ran away. They ran out of the motel.
what is it?
what are you doing?
we're going back for them. We get them in the car and that's it.
Pablo!
hello.
it says he stops around here.
50 miles away.
I think he had the man's body in the trunk.
Damn! There is no signal.
let's call the police.
he buried him around here, in an abandoned factory.
what are you doing?
we have to do something, right?
we must help these people.
we have to go to that factory.
I'm not going anywhere.
we have to call the police.
I don't know what's up...
but this can't be coincidence.
this all happened 20 years ago and some bastard's copying it, step by step and exactly at the same hour.
you know that's not possible.
somebody killed that guy.
you heard it just like me.
then he picked them up on the road.
shall I read it?
the child and the woman got away.
I haven't even had time to regret my clumsiness.
they just appeared on the road.
they come to me like lsaac came to Abraham to be sacrificed.
shall I go on?
no. - So you won't do anything?
if nothing happened, you won't mind going to that place.
you're a real son-of-a-bitch.
I'll take a look. Are you coming?
no way, I'm not moving.
look, if this were a movie like the one we saw on TV, you'd be topless by now.
and what we just saw...
yes?
would be...
ghosts?
you said it, not me.
I don't believe in that stuff.
I believe in bad vibrations. This place has bad vibrations.
did you steal that from the minibar?
look, Malena...
I'm going in there.
if they cut my head off, don't you worry.
need anything? A blanket?
the flashlight. - You're not going anywhere.
give it here. - I won't.
give it to me.
look.
I can see fine with this.
I don't care what you do, but I just have to say one thing.
if you scream, I'll kill you. You hear me?
if anything happens to you...
I'll kill you.
Malena!
Malena!
Pablo!
Pablo!
help me!
please don't go.
Where's my little girl?
what'll happen to her?
he's coming! Please help me.
please, I don't want to die. Help me!
please!
are you okay?
Malena.
are you going to tell me what happened in there?
Malena.
I'm talking to you, Malena.
say something.
shall we go on crying?
or call mommy?
you fucking baby!
come on, you spoiled brat.
leave me alone, you son-of-a-bitch!
it's all right now.
he took her away in front of me.
she was pregnant.
I'm scared, Pablo.
I'm really scared.
don't worry. As soon as we reach the next town we'll go to the police.
let's see, he gets to the motel and waits 'til nightfall.
at 3 AM he goes up to the room and attacks the husband.
here he buries the father.
but where does he take the girl and the mother?
the girl... dead...
the son-of-a-bitch.
God!
I'm going to the restroom.
Hey, that's not necessary.
don't.
ten minutes.
Hello?
Hello?
I'll get you out of there.
Where's that son of a bitch?
mommy.
I'll be back, I promise.
Malena, start the car.
start the car.
what have you done?
start the car, dammit!
where did you find her? - Can't you see?
come on.
shit!
you're always the same.
always sticking your nose...
you just kidnapped a little girl.
I hadn't thought of that...
since kids travel in car trunks now.
shut up, okay?
couldn't you have called for help?
what do you think the police are for?
you committed a crime. - I saved the kid's life.
sure. - Fuck that son-of-a-bitch!
so what do we do with the girl?
fuck.
I've had enough. Shit.
fucking kid!
put your foot down!
son-of-a-bitch!
faster, dammit! - I'm trying.
go there, where there are people.
that bar.
Malena, start the car!
fucking start the car! - It won't start!
forget it. Let's go.
get out!
open up!
open the door! Please!
please!
pull.
it says "pull" on the door.
take it easy, okay?
there's blood on you.
let's get breakfast.
breakfast? We have to call the police.
hello. - Can I have a coffee with milk?
weak but really hot, please.
and something to eat. You, Malena?
coffee. - And the little girl?
are you okay?
anything else?
some cereal for the girl, please.
right. - Thank you.
that's it, I'm calling the police.
we just saved the girl.
fuck the police.
you want to call them?
Yes. - Fucking great.
do you have the nerve to tell them what happened?
son-of-a-bitch.
Hello? I want to report an incident.
Yes, I'll wait.
Hello? Look, someone's following us.
they wrecked our car, tried to force us off the road.
no, we're not hurt but...
it's hard to explain.
can't you send someone?
two of us...three. With a little girl that my brother...
forget it. I don't really know where I am so don't come...
I'll ring some other time.
spectacular.
I couldn't have done that so well.
come on...
just a spoonful.
come on, you have to eat just a little. If not, you won't grow big and strong.
call an ambulance, please.
what? - Call an ambulance please!
maybe there's still a chance.
are you all right?
don't just stand there! Call someone, dammit!
what's the matter, are you joking? - Don't you see?
what happened in there is not real. - I don't even want to talk about it.
nobody is gonna help us.
I just want to go back to Barcelona.
I don't care about the will, the house, anything...
I can't take anymore.
I want to get away.
what will you do?
I don't know.
do something for those people.
those people are dead and nobody gives a shit.
you don't give a shit! You're just so selfish!
so go. That's what you always do.
is that what you want? Go but stop winding me up.
Malena.
stay here with me, okay?
we'll take the ferry tomorrow.
promise nothing else will happen.
I promise.
well, the starter motor's perfect now.
the car's old, but it's still strong.
I can't do anything about the door.
no spare parts. - That's okay.
as long as it goes.
you know what? I like doing things right, that's all.
the spare parts truck doesn't come this way.
they were building a highway but that got spoiled.
how did it get spoiled?
how did it get spoiled?
same as always. - Pablo.
they had to knock down an old factory and they started digging.
you start finding skeletons, a dead body buried 20 years ago and police and journalists come swarming.
so in the end the highway went to shit.
where was the dead body?
come here.
there.
375 miles away at the foundry.
they mentioned an investigation in the papers.
talked about the military, this and that...
where can I get a copy of that paper? If you want, I can...
look, it's 380 pesos for the repair.
if you want a copy of the paper, come with me.
put your money away.
how you doing, Pelegrini?
fine.
our Spanish friend wants to see some of your old newspapers.
would he like a propeller for a sailboat?
a real bargain. Seventy pesos...
it just needs a little fixing.
want a propeller? - No, just the newspapers.
fifty. That's my final offer.
fifty. That's a gift.
I'd never given much thought to how I would die.
but dying in the place of someone I love... seems like a good way to go.
so, I can't bring myself to regret the decision to leave home.
I would miss Phoenix,
I'd miss the heat,
I would miss my loving, erratic, harebrained mother and her new husband.
guys, come on! I love you both, we got a plane to catch.
but they wanna go on the road, So I'm gonna spend some time with my dad
and this will be a good thing... I think.
in the state of Washington, Under a near constant cover of clouds and rain, There's a small town named Forks.
population: 3120 people.
this is where I'm moving
my dad's Charlie.
he's the Chief of Police.
your hair's longer.
I cut since last time I saw you.
I guess it grew a lot again.
I used to spend two weeks here almost every summer, but it's been years...
I cleared some shelves up in the bathroom.
Oh, right...
one bathroom.
it's a pretty good work lamp.
the Sears lady picked up the bed stuff.
you like purple, right?
purple's cool.
Thanks.
okay.
one of the best things about Charlie... he doesn't hover.
I heard you guys coming all the way down the road. Good to see you.
Bella, you remember Billy Black...
Yeah.
you're looking good.
I'm still dancing.
Charlie here hasn't shut up about it since you told him you were coming.
alright, keep exaggerating... I'll roll you into the mud -Until I ram you in the ankles.
Yeah, bring it!
Hi, I'm Jacob.
we used to make mud pies when we were little.
right, I remember.
are they always like this?
it's getting worse with old age.
so, what do you think?
what?
your homecoming present.
this?
just bought it off Billy, here. -Yep.
I totally rebuilt the engine for you.
come on!
Oh My Gosh!
this is perfect!
you must be joking!
sorry.
I told you she'd love it.
I'm down with the kids.
Oh, yeah dude. You're the bomb.
okay, -you gotta double pump the clutch when you shift but... besides that, you should be good.
that's this one?
Yeah, right there.
alright.
you want a ride to school or something?
I go to school on the reservation.
Oh, right.
that's too bad. It would've been good to know one person.
my first day in a new school.
it's March, the middle of the semester.
great.
nice ride.
Thanks.
you're Isabella Swan, the new girl.
Hi! I'm Eric, the eyes and ears of this place.
anything you need? Tour guide, lunch date...
a shoulder to cry on...
I'm really kind of a more 'suffer in silence' type -Good headline for your feature.
I'm on the paper and you're news baby, -front page.
please don't...
Whoa! Relax...
no feature.
cool? -Thanks. cool -I'm sorry.
I told them not to let me play.
no, no... That's...
you're Isabella, right?
just Bella.
Yeah, hey! I'm Mike... Newton.
nice to meet you.
she's got a great spike, huh?
I'm Jessica, by the way...
Hey, you're from Arizona, right?
Yeah.
aren't people from Arizona supposed to be like... Really tan?
Yeah, maybe that's why they kicked me out.
you're good.
that's so funny... a Master Piece.
we're gonna have like this crazy pyramid fall from the sky.
hey Mikey! You met my home girl, Bella.
Oh, your home girl?
Yeah.
my girl!
Oh, Tyler...
Oh my God, -it's like first grade all over again.
you're the shiny new toy.
smile!
okay...
sorry, I needed the candid for the feature...
feature's dead, Angela.
don't bring it up again.
it's okay, I just...
I got your back, baby...
I guess we'll just turn another editorial on teen drinking...
you can always go for... the eating disorders... speedo padding on the swim team...
actually, that's a good one.
Yeah, right. That's exactly what I thought.
we're talking Olympic size.
there's no way, he's so skinny. It doesn't make sense...
totally -Who are they?
the Cullens.
they're, um... they moved down here from Alaska a few years ago.
they kind of keep to themselves.
Yeah, 'cause they're all together...
like together together.
the blond girl, that's Rosalie, -and the big dark-haired guy, Emmett...
they're like a thing.
I'm not even sure that's legal.
Jess, they're not actually related.
Yeah, but they live together... It's weird.
and... Okay, -the little dark-haired girl is Alice...
she's really weird.
and... She's with Jasper, the blonde one, who looks like he's in pain.
Dr. Cullen is like this foster dadlmatchmaker...
maybe he'll adopt me.
who's he?
he's totally gorgeous, obviously.
but apparently nobody here is good enough for him.
like I care... You know.
so... Yeah...
seriously, don't waste your time...
I wasn't planning on it.
Mr. Molina? -Hey, Mike.
Oh, yes... Ms. Swan.
Hi, your pass?
thank you. -Welcome to class.
here's your stuff, okay?
and...
I got a seat for you right here, it's the last one so... just tag along until you catch up.
alright guys, today we're gonna be observing the behavior of Planaria, -a.k.a. flatworms...
there must be something open...
physics? Biochem?
every class is full, my dear.
I just checked in here.
I'm afraid you'll have to stay in Biology.
fine, I'll just... accept to endure it.
I just can't get over how grown up you are.
and so gorgeous.
Hey, Bella!
you remember me?
I played Santa one year...
Yeah, Waylon... She hasn't had a Christmas here since she was four.
I bet I made an impression, didn't I?
you always do... bad crack Santa.
Hey! Kids love those little bottles though.
let the girl eat her Garden Burger, Waylon.
berry Cobbler, remember?
your dad still has it...
every Thursday.
thank you, that will be great.
hey baby! So listen, -if Phil's training goes well, -we could be moving to Florida.
mom, where's your cel?
okay, don't laugh.
I didn't lose my power cord, it ran away...
screaming.
I literally repel technology now.
I miss you.
Oh, Baby! I miss you too.
but tell me more about your school... What are the kids like?
are there any cute guys?
are they being nice to you?
well... They're all very welcoming.
Uh-oh. Tell me all about it.
it doesn't even matter.
yes it does, honey!
I have homework to do.
I'll talk to you later.
okay, I love you.
love you too.
I planned to confront him... and demand to know what his problem was.
but he never showed.
and the next day... another no-show.
more days passed...
and things were getting a little... strange.
are you alright?
Yeah, I'm good.
ice doesn't really help the uncoordinated.
yeah... That's why I had some new tires put on the truck.
the old ones were getting really bold.
well, I'll probably be late for dinner.
gotta head down to Mason County.
a security guard at the Grisham mill got killed by some kind of animal.
an animal?
you're not in Phoenix anymore, Bells.
anyway, I figured I'd lend a hand.
be careful.
always am.
and thanks for the tires.
Yeah.
prom Committee is a chick thing but, -I got it covered for the paper anyway, -and they need a guy to help choose the music, so... I need your playlist.
Hey! Listen, I was wondering... um, Did you have a date to the...
what's up, Arizona! Huh?
you're liking the rain, girl?
you gotta get used to it, girl.
hey Mike, you're real cute man. -Oh, no...
hello.
I'm sorry I didn't get the chance to introduce myself last week.
I'm Edward Cullen...
you're Bella?
Yes.
onion root tip cells!
that's what's on your slides right now. Okay?
so separate and label them into the phases of Mitosis.
and the first partners to get it right are gonna win... the golden onion!
ladies first...
you were gone...
Yeah. Um, I was out of town for a couple of days. Personal reasons.
prophase.
you mind if I... look?
it's prophase.
like I said.
so... You're enjoying the rain?
what?
you're asking me about the weather?
yeah...
I guess I am.
well, I don't really like the rain...
any cold, -wet thing...
and I'm really...
what?
nothing.
it's... Anaphase. -You mind if I check?
sure.
anaphase.
like I said.
if you hate the cold and the rain so much, -why did you move to wettest place in the continental U. S?
it's complicated.
I'm sure I can keep up.
um, my mom remarried and...
so, you don't like the guy...?
no, that's not... Phil's really nice.
it's Metaphase. You wanna check it?
no, I believe you.
why didn't you move with your mother and Phil?
well, Phil's a minor league baseball player.
and he travels a lot.
my mom stayed home with me but I knew it didn't make her happy so...
I figured I'd stay with my dad for a while...
and now you're unhappy.
no...
I'm sorry, I'm just trying to figure you out.
you're very difficult for me to read.
Hey, did you get contacts?
no.
your eyes were black the last time I saw you and now... they're like golden-brown.
Yeah, I know. It's the... Um, -it's the fluorescence.
Bella, I'm so sorry... I panicked.
Bella! I've got 911 on the phone now.
are you okay?
you and I are gonna talk.
you alright? -I'm fine dad, calm down.
I'm sorry Bella, I tried to stop.
I know, it's okay.
no, as sure as hell it's not okay.
dad, it wasn't his fault.
you could've been killed. You understand that?
Yes. But I wasn't, so...
you can kiss your license goodbye.
I heard the Chief's daughter was in...
Oh, Dr. Cullen.
I got this one, Jackie.
well, Bella... Looks like it's a quiet spill. How do you feel?
good.
look here...
you might experience some post-traumatic stress or... disorientation but... your vitals are good.
no signs of any head trauma.
I think you'll be just fine.
I'm so sorry Bella, I'm really...
it would have been a lot worse if Edward wasn't there. He knocked me out of the way.
Edward? Your boy?
Yeah, it was amazing.
I mean, he got to me so fast... He was nowhere near me.
sounds like you were very lucky.
I need to sign some paperwork...
you should probably call your mom.
did you tell her?
she's probably just... freaking out.
...what happened.
what was I supposed to do? Let her die?
this isn't just about you. It's about all of us.
I think we should talk this in my office...
can I talk to you for a minute?
what?
how did you get over to me so fast?
I was standing right next to you, Bella.
no, -you were next to your car... Across the lot.
no, I wasn't.
Yes, you were!
Bella, you hit your head... I think you're confused.
I know what I saw.
what exactly was that?
you... You stopped the van.
you pushed it away with your hand.
well, nobody's gonna believe you, so...
I wasn't gonna tell anybody.
I just need to know the truth...
can't you just thank me and get over it?
thank you.
you're not gonna let this go, are you?
no.
well, then I hope you enjoy disappointment.
that was the first night I dreamt with Edward Cullen.
I need everybody's permission slips, so...
let's go!
look at you, huh?
you're alive!
I know, Yeah... False alarm, I guess.
um, now I wanted to ask you, you know...
if... It's like a month away but...
do you wanna go to Prom...?
so... What do you think?
about what?
do you wanna go...?
to Prom...?
with me?
Oh! I... Prom... dancing... not such a good idea for me.
I have something that weekend, anyway.
I'm going to Jacksonville that weekend.
you can't go another weekend?
non-refundable ticket...
you should ask Jessica.
I know she wants to go with you.
hey guys! Come on!
we gotta go, we gotta go! Green is what?
good! Let's go!
guys, come on!
other bus... Other bus... Let's go!
eggshells, carrot-tops...
compost is cool! Now stuff it in there...
yes sir! Yes sir! -Very good, very good.
now I'm gonna make a steaming cup of compost-tea.
give me that...
Yeah, this is recycling in its most basic form, guys... Don't drink it! It's for the plants...
what's in Jacksonville?
how did you know about that?
I... You didn't answer my question.
well, you don't answer any of mine, so...
I mean, you don't even say 'Hi' to me.
Hi.
are you gonna tell me how you stopped the van?
yeah... I had an adrenaline rush.
it's very common.
you can Google-it.
Floridians...
that's what's in Jacksonville.
can you at least watch where you walk?!
look... I'm sorry I'm being rude all the time.
I just think it's the best way.
Bella! Guess who's just asked me to Prom.
um, yeah... I actually thought Mike was gonna ask you...
um, it's not gonna be weird though, right?
no, Zero weirdness.
you guys are great together.
I know, right?
Bella, look.
it's a worm... It's a worm...
Bella... We shouldn't be friends.
I mean, why didn't you just let the van crush me...
and save yourself all this... regret?
you think I regret saving you?
I can see that you do... I just... don't know why.
you don't know anything.
Hi! Um... Are you gonna be riding with us?
no, our bus is full.
your mom called. Again.
well, that's your fault, you shouldn't have told her about the almost-accident.
are you finished?
Yeah.
I suppose you're right. She always did know how to worry.
she seems different...
she seems happy.
Phil sounds like an alright guy...
Yeah, he is...
alright...
Hey! La Push, baby... Are you in?
should I know what that means?
la Push Beach down the Quileute Rez. We're all going tomorrow.
Yeah, there's a big fun coming in.
and I don't just surf the Internet.
Eric, you stood up once...
and it was a foam board.
but there's whale watching too. Come with us.
la Push, baby...
it's... La Push.
I'll go if you stop saying that, okay?
seriously dude... It's creepy, man.
edible art?
Thanks.
you know, your mood swings are kind of giving me a whiplash.
I only said it'd be better for you if we weren't friends, not that I didn't want to be.
what does that mean?
it means, if you're smart, you'd stay away from me.
well, let's say for argument sake that I'm not smart.
will you tell me truth?
no, probably not.
I'd rather hear your theories.
I have considered... Radioactive spiders and Kryptonite.
that's all super-hero stuff, right?
what if I'm not the hero?
what if I'm... the bad guy?
you're not.
I can see what you're trying to put off.
but I can see that it's just to keep people away from you.
that's a mask.
why don't we just... hang out?
everybody is going to the beach.
come...
I mean, have fun.
which beach?
la Push.
is there something wrong with that beach?
it's just a little crowded.
its freezing...
you gotta go out, folks...
I don't know if it's worth it anymore we're all the way out here...
you guys are babies.
so, I keep thinking that Eric's gonna ask me to the Prom...
and he just... doesn't.
you should ask him.
I am?
Yes.
can you help me out?
Yeah.
hi Jacob! Guys, this is Jacob.
Hey, Guys. How you doing?
Hi. -Hey.
what are you, like, stalking me?
you're on my rez, remember?
are you surfing?
definitely not.
you guys should keep Bella company. Um, her date bailed.
what date?
she invited Edward.
to be polite, that's it.
I think it's nice she invited him. Nobody ever does.
Yeah, 'cause Cullen's a freak.
you got that right!
you guys know him?
the Cullens don't come here.
what did your friends mean about...
you know, 'The Cullens don't come here'?
you caught that, huh?
I'm not really supposed to say anything about it.
Hey, I can keep a secret.
um, really it's just like an old scary story...
well, I want to know.
okay, did you know that Quileutes are supposedly descendants from wolves?
what?
like wolves... Real wolves?
yeah... That's a legend of our tribe.
okay... So, what's the story about the Cullens?
well, they're supposedly descendants from this, like... enemy clan.
my great-grandfather, the chief, -But they claimed to be something different, so... We made a treaty with them.
if they promised to say off Quileute lands, -then we wouldn't expose what they really were to...
the pale faces.
I thought they just moved here... or just moved back.
what are they really?
it's just a story, Bella.
come on, let's go.
Hello?
girl?
girl!
hello.
nice jacket.
who are you?
it's always the same inane questions...
who are you?'
what do you want?'
why are you doing this?'
let's not play with our food.
he's not here.
whenever the weather's nice the Cullens disappear.
what? They just ditch?
no, Dr. and Mrs. Cullen yank them out for hiking and camping and stuff.
I tried that on my parents... Not even close.
guys! I'm going to the Prom with Eric.
I just asked him... I took control.
I told you that would happen.
are you sure you have to go out of town?
Oh, yeah. It's a weird family thing.
okay, we should go shopping to Port Angeles before all the good dresses get cleaned out.
port Angeles?
you mind if I come?
Yeah! I need your opinion...
I like this one...
that's cool.
but I don't know about the one-shoulder thing...
I like this one.
Yeah, I like the knitting.
Jess, what do you think? Lavender?
is that good? Is that my color?
I like it. I like that dusty-rose one too.
okay, I like this one... It makes my boobs look good.
Hey! Nice!
that is uncomfortable.
Oh, it's disgusting...
Bella, what do you think?
looks great.
you said that about the last five dresses though.
I thought they were pretty good.
not really into this, are you?
I, actually, really just wanna go to this bookstore...
meet you guys at the restaurant?
are you sure?
Yeah, see you in a minute.
okay. -Okay.
she's right though... It looks awesome.
here you go...
good night.
thank you.
we saw you at the dress shop.
Hey, where are you running to?
there she is...
how are you guys doing?
what's up, girl?
Whoa! Where are you going?
where are you going?
hang out with us.
what's the problem?
you're pretty. -Don't touch me.
seriously, you should...
don't touch me!
get in the car.
that was a very dangerous... move.
I should go back there and rip those guy's heads off.
no, you shouldn't.
you don't know the vile, repulsive things they're thinking.
and you do?
it was not hard to guess.
can you talk about something else...
and distract me so I won't turn around?
can you just put your seatbelt on?
put your own seatbelt on.
Hey! Guys, I'm sorry. I just...
where were you? We left you messages.
we waited but we were starving, so we...
I'm sorry I kept Bella from dinner.
we just ran into each other and got talking.
no, we totally understand, I mean...
that happens, right?
um, we were just leaving so...
Bella, you wanna...
I think I should make sure Bella gets something to eat...
if you'd like.
I'll drive you home myself.
that's so... thoughtful.
it's really thoughtful, yeah.
Yeah, I should eat something.
okay, so... I'll see you tomorrow.
see you... -Okay.
one Mushroom Ravioli.
Thanks.
Yeah, no problem.
so... Are you sure there isn't anything I can get for you?
no, no. Thank you.
let me know...
you're really not gonna eat?
no, I'm on a... special diet.
you gotta give me some answers.
yes... No...
to get to the other side...
I don't want to know what the square root of Pi is.
you knew that?
how did you know where I was?
I didn't.
alright...
don't leave...
did you... follow me?
I feel very... protective of you.
so you followed me.
I was trying to keep a distance unless you needed my help and then... I heard what those low-lives were thinking...
wait... You say you heard what they were thinking?
so what... You read minds...
I can read every mind in this room...
apart from yours.
money... Sex...
money... Sex...
cat.
and then you... Nothing.
it's very frustrating.
there's something wrong with me?
I tell you I can read minds and you think there's something wrong with you.
what is it?
I don't have... the strength... to stay away from you anymore.
then don't.
okay, I think I'm warm enough now.
your hand is so cold.
Whoa! What is going on?
my dad's still here. Can you pull in?
it's my father's car in there.
what is he doing here?
Carlisle, what's going on?
Waylon Forge was found in a boat out near his place.
I just examined the body.
he died?
how?
animal attack.
was it the same one that got that security guard down at Mason?
most likely.
it must be getting closer to town then...
you should go inside.
Waylon was your father's friend.
okay...
um, I'll see you later.
hey...
Hey.
dad, I'm really sorry.
not one gone in thirty years.
don't worry, we're gonna find this thing.
in the meantime, -I want you to carry this with you.
let's go home.
you're impossibly fast...
and strong.
your skin is pale white and ice cold.
your eyes change color...
and sometimes you speak like... like you're from a different time.
you never eat or drink anything...
you don't go out in the sunlight.
how old are you?
seventeen.
how long have you been seventeen?
a while.
I know what you are.
say it... out loud.
say it!
vampire.
are you afraid?
no.
then ask me the most basic question:
what do we eat?
you won't hurt me.
where are we going?
up the mountain, out of the cloud bag.
you need to see what I look like in the sunlight.
this is why we don't show ourselves in sunlight.
people would know we're different.
this is what I am.
it's like diamonds...
you're beautiful.
Beautiful...? This is the skin of a killer, Bella.
I'm a killer.
I don't believe that.
that's because you believe the lie... the camouflage.
I'm the world's most dangerous predator.
everything about me invites you in... my voice, my face... Even my smell.
as if I would need any of that.
as if you could outrun me!
as if you could fight me off.
I'm designed to kill.
I don't care.
I've killed people before.
it doesn't matter.
I wanted to kill you.
I've never wanted a human's blood so much in my life.
I trust you.
don't.
I'm here, I trust you.
my family, we're different from others of our kind.
we only hunt animals...
we've learned to control our thirst.
as to you... Your scent... Is like a drug to me.
like my own personal brand of heroin.
then, why did you hate me so much when we met?
I did. Only for making me want you so badly.
I still don't know if I can control myself.
I know you can.
I can't read your mind, -you have to tell me what you're thinking.
now I'm afraid.
good.
I'm not afraid of you...
I'm only afraid of losing you...
like you're going to disappear.
you don't know how long I've waited for you.
and so the lion fell in love with the lamb...
what a stupid lamb.
what a sick, masochistic lion.
about three things I was absolutely positive:
first, Edward was a vampire.
second, there was a part of him, and I didn't know how dominant that part might be, that thirsted for my blood.
and third, I was unconditionally and irrevocably in love with him.
Monte Carlo? That's our Prom theme?
Uhu, gambling... Tuxedos...
and Bond... James Bond.
Oh... My... God...
you know, everybody's staring...
not that guy...
no, he just looked.
I'm breaking all the rules now anyway...
since I'm going to hell.
so... Does a person have to be dying... to become like you?
no, that's just Carlisle.
he'd never do this to someone who had another choice.
so, how long have you been like this?
since 1918...
that's when Carlisle found me...dying of Spanish Influenza.
what was it like?
the venom was excruciating...
but what Carlisle did was much harder.
not many of us have the restraint to do that.
but didn't he just have to... bite?
not exactly.
when we taste... human blood...
a sort of frenzy begins.
it's almost impossible to stop.
but Carlisle did.
first with me...
and then with his wife, Esme.
so, is Carlisle the real reason that you don't... kill people?
no, that's not the only reason...
I don't want to be a monster.
my family, we think of ourselves as vegetarians...
cause we only survive on the blood of animals.
it's like a human only living on toffee.
it keeps you strong but you're never fully satisfied.
it wouldn't be like drinking your blood, for instance...
was it other vampires that killed Waylon?
Yeah, -there are others out there...
we run into them from time to time.
can the rest of your family read people's minds like you can?
no, no. That's just me.
but Alice can see the future.
I bet she saw me coming.
Alice's vision is subjective...
I mean, the future can always change.
can you act human?
I mean, I've got neighbors.
I'm gonna take you to my place tomorrow.
thanks...
wait, with your family?
Yeah.
what if they don't like me?
so you're worried... Not because you'll be in a house full of vampires but... because you think they won't approve of you?
I'm glad I missed you.
what is it?
a complication.
I'll pick you up tomorrow.
Hey! Come to visit your truck?
looks good...
got that dent out... -Yeah.
actually, we came to visit your flat-screen.
first Mariners game of the season.
Plus, Jacob here keeps bugging me about seeing you again.
great, dad... Thanks.
just keeping it real, son.
pale Ale.
well done, Chief...
Harry Clearwater's homemade fish fry.
good.
any luck with that Waylon case?
well, I don't think it was an animal that killed him.
I never thought it was...
you spread the word out at the rez, huh?
keep the kids out of the woods...
will do.
don't want no one else getting hurt, do we?
don't want no one else getting hurt, do we?
this is incredible.
it's so white and open, you know.
what did you expect...
coffins and dungeons and moats?
no, not the moats.
not the moats...
this is the one place we don't have to hide.
I told them not to do this.
is she even Italian?
her name is Bella.
I'm sure she'll love it no matter what.
get a whiff of that...
here comes the human...
Bella! We're making Italiano for you.
Oh!
Bella, this is Esme. My mother for all intents and purposes.
you've given us an excuse to use the kitchen for the first time.
I hope you're hungry.
Yeah, absolutely...
she already ate.
perfect!
Yeah, it's just...
I know you guys don't eat...
of course, it's very considerate of you.
just ignore Rosalie. I do.
Yeah, let's just keep pretending like this isn't dangerous for all of us.
I would never tell anybody anything...
she knows that.
Yeah, well, the problem is...
you two have become public now, so...
Emmett! Emmett! -No, she should know.
the entire family will be implicated if this ends badly.
badly as in...
I become the meal.
Hi, Bella!
I'm Alice.
Hi.
Oh, you do smell good.
Alice, what are you...?
it's ok. Bella and I are gonna be great friends.
sorry, Jasper's our newest vegetarian.
it's a little difficult for him.
it's a pleasure to meet you.
it's okay, Jasper. You won't hurt her.
alright...
I'm gonna take you on a tour of the rest of the house.
I'll see you soon...
okay.
cute...
I think that went well.
clean this up.
now!
graduation caps?
Yeah, -it's a private joke.
we matriculate a lot.
that's kind of miserable. I mean, repeating High School over and over...
sure but the younger we start out in a new place, -the longer we can stay there.
come on...
um, yeah... This is my room.
no bed?
no, -I don't sleep.
ever?
no.
okay...
you have so much music.
what were you listening to?
it's Debussy.
Yeah.
Clair de Lune is great.
what?
I can't dance.
well, I can always make you.
I'm not scared of you.
well, you really shouldn't have said that.
you better hold on tight, spider monkey.
do you trust me?
in theory.
then close your eyes.
what?
this isn't real.
this kind of stuff just doesn't exist.
it does in my world.
Whoa! Hold on.
it's human.
Arizona! Yo, what's happening? So... You and Cullen, huh?
that's...
I don't like it, -I mean... He looks at you like you're something to eat -Here's your veggie plate...
I'm sorry I'm late. Biology Projects.
I ordered you the Spam Salad.
I hope that's okay.
you should order one for yourself next time.
Cup-egg on a steak...
Hey, I'm as healthy as a horse.
so, Chief... Boys wanna know, -Did you find anything down by Creek Silver today?
Yeah, We found a bare human footprint.
but it looks like whatever that is, it's headed to east.
so, Ketsap's County sheriff is gonna take over from here.
okay...
okay?
I just hope they catch them fast.
looks like your friends are flagging you.
it's okay. If you wanna go, join them.
I was gonna try to leave early anyway.
me too.
Bella, Friday night... Go out.
looks like the Newton boy's got a big smile for you.
Yeah, he's a good buddy.
better than any of these other yahoos in town.
anybody you're interested?
dad, we're gonna talk about boys?
I guess not.
I just feel like I leave alone too much...
you should be around people.
I don't mind being alone...
I guess I'm kind of like my dad in that way.
so, how's all the baseball stuff going?
Oh, Phil's working so hard.
you know... Spring training.
we're looking for a house to rent in case thinks become more permanent.
you'd like Jacksonville, baby.
yeah?
I'm really liking Forks.
What?!
forks is getting to me.
could a guy have anything to do with that?
yeah...
I knew it! Tell me everything. What is he? A jock?
Indie? I bet he's smart. Is he smart?
mom, can I talk to you later?
come on, we gotta talk boys! Are you being safe?
how did you get in here?
the window.
do you do that a lot?
just the past couple months.
I like watching you sleep...
it's, um...
kind of fascinating to me.
um, I just want to try one thing...
stay very still.
don't move...
stop!
I'm sorry...
I'm stronger than I thought.
yeah... I wish I could say the same.
I can never lose control with you.
Hey, don't go...
Hey, I got you another one.
Thanks.
I have a date with Edward Cullen.
he's a little old for you, isn't he?
no... He's a junior, I'm a junior.
I thought you liked the Cullens.
I thought you didn't like any of the boys in town.
edward doesn't live in town...
technically.
he's right outside.
he is?
Yeah, he wanted to meet you... Officially.
alright...
bring him in.
could you be nice?
he is important.
chief Swan... I want to formally introduce myself. I'm Edward Cullen.
Hi, Edward.
Bella won't be out too late tonight.
she's just gonna play baseball with my family.
baseball?
yes sir, that's the plan.
Bella's gonna play baseball?
well, good luck with that...
I'll take good care of her, I promise.
hey... You still got that pepper spray?
Yeah, dad.
since when do vampires like baseball?
well, it's the American pastime.
And...There's a thunderstorm coming. It's the only time we can play.
you'll see why.
I'm glad you're here... We need an umpire.
she thinks we cheat.
I know you cheat.
call them as you see them, Bella.
okay.
it's time...
okay, now I see why you need the thunder.
that's gonna be a homerun, right?
Edward's very fast.
you're out.
out! Whoo!
babe, come on! It's just a game.
nice, kid...
my monkey-man...
stop!
they were leaving, then they heard us.
let's go.
it's too late.
get your hair up.
like that would help. I could smell her from across the field.
I shouldn't have brought you here. I'm so sorry...
what?
just be quiet and stand behind me.
I believe this belongs to you.
thank you.
I'm Laurent...
and this is Victoria...
and James.
I'm Carlisle...
this is my family.
hello.
I'm afraid your hunting activities have caused something of a mess for us.
our apologies.
we didn't realize the territory had been claimed.
Yes, well... We maintain a permanent residence nearby.
Really?
well, we won't be a problem anymore.
we were just passing through.
the humans were tracking us but we lead them east.
you should be safe.
excellent.
so...
could you use three more players?
Oh, come on. Just one game.
sure, -why not?
three of us were leaving...
you can take their place.
you go first.
I'm the one with the wicked curve-ball.
well, I think we can handle that.
we shall see...
you brought a snack.
you're human?
the girl is with us.
I think it best if you leave.
I can see the game is over.
we'll go now.
get Bella out of here... Go.
okay, I've got it! I've got it! I'm alright.
what? Now James is coming after me?
listen to me, James is a tracker.
the hunt is his obsession. I read his mind.
my reaction at the field set him off.
I just made this his most exciting game ever.
he's never gonna stop.
what should we do? -We have to kill him.
rip him apart and burn the pieces.
where are we going?
away from Forks...
we'll get a ferry to Vancouver.
I have to go home, now! You should take me home.
you can't go home.
he's just gonna trace your scent there... It's the first place he's gonna look.
but my dad is there...
it doesn't matter!
Yes, it does! He could get killed because of us.
just let me get you out of here first, alright?
it's my dad! We have to go back.
we'll figure how to lead the tracker away somehow... I don't know!
but we have to do something.
Edward, I said leave me alone!
Bella, don't do this, please...
it's over, get out!
hey... Hey hey!
Bella, what's going on?
I just gotta get out of here.
I'm leaving... Now!
what am I gonna say to him?
I can't hurt him.
Bella, what's going on? -You'll just have to.
I'll be down at the truck.
did he hurt you?
no.
break up with you or something?
no, I... I broke up with him.
I thought you liked him.
Yeah, that's just why I have to leave.
I don't want this, I have to go home.
home...? Your mom is not even in Phoenix.
she'll come home. I'll call her from the road.
you don't have to drive home right now.
you can sleep on it.
if you still feel like going in the morning, I'll take you to the airport.
no, I want to drive, it will give more time to think.
if I get really tired, I'll pull into a motel... I promise.
look, Bella...I know I'm not that much fun to be around...
but I can change that...
we can do more stuff together.
like what? Like watch baseball on the flatscreen?
eat at the dinner every night? Steak and Cobbler?
dad, that's you... That's not me.
Bella, come on. I just... got you back.
Yeah, you know... If I don't get out now, -I'm just gonna be just stuck here like mom.
your father's gonna forgive you.
why don't you let me drive?
he won't.
you should have seen his face...
I told him the same thing that my mom told him when she was leaving him.
it was the only way he'd let you go.
just don't worry about him now. He's safe. The tracker's following us.
it's just Emmett.
Alice is in the car behind us.
wait!
he came to warn us... About James.
this isn't my fight and...
but he's got unparalleled senses, absolutely lethal.
I've never seen anything like him in my three hundred years.
and the woman, Victoria... Don't underestimate her.
I've had to fight our kind before. We're not easy to kill.
but not impossible.
we'll rip him apart and burn the pieces.
I don't relish the thought of killing another creature.
even a sadistic one like James.
what if he kills one of us first?
I'm gonna run Bella south and then lead the tracker away from here.
no, Edward. James knows you'd never leave Bella. He'll follow you.
I'll go with Bella. Jasper and I will drive her south.
I'll keep her safe, Edward.
can you keep your thoughts to yourself?
Yes.
could you put these on so...
Why? What is she to me?
Rosalie...Bella is with Edward. She is part of this family now.
and we protect our family.
if anything happens, I just...
nothing's gonna happen.
there's seven of us against two of them.
and when everything's done, I'm gonna come back and get you.
Yeah.
Bella, you are my life now.
Hey, mom. It's me again.
um, you must have let your phone die or something...
I'm not in Forks but everything's okay and I'll explain it later.
rose, among the three.
that's good.
what is it? What did you see?
he figured it out.
the tracker. He just changed course.
where will it take him, Alice?
Mirrors... A room full of mirrors.
edward said the visions weren't always certain.
she sees the course people are on while they're on it.
if they change their minds, the vision changes.
so, the course that the tracker's on now is gonna lead him to... A ballet studio?
you've been here?
I took lessons as a kid.
the school I went to had an arch just like that.
was your school here in Phoenix?
Yeah.
Edward, you okay?
we've lost the tracker. The woman's still in the area.
Rosalie and Esme have gone back to Forks to protect your father.
I'm coming to get you.
then you and I are gonna go somewhere...
alone.
and the others will keep hunting.
I'll do whatever it takes to make you safe again.
Hey, mom! I'm glad you got my message.
what are you doing home?
Bella! Bella, Bella?! Where are you?
calm down, everything's fine.
I'll explain everything later... Mom, are you alright?
forks High School doesn't protect the student's privacy very well.
it was just too easy for Victoria to find your previous address.
it's a nice house you have here.
I was prepared to wait for you.
but then mom came home after she received...
it all worked out quite well.
-Don't touch her! Don't.!
you can still save her.
but you're gonna have to get away from your friends.
can you handle that?
where should I meet you?
how about your old ballet studio?
and I'd know if you bring anyone along...
poor mommy would pay the price for that mistake.
I'd never given much thought to how I would die...
but dying in the place of someone I love, seems like a good way to go.
I can't bring myself to regret the decisions that brought me face to face with dead.
they also brought me to Edward.
mom.
Bella? -Mom!
that's my favorite part.
you were a stubborn child, weren't you?
she's not even here...
sorry... But you really made it too easy.
so... To make things more entertaining, -we are gonna make a little film of our time together.
I borrowed this from your house. I hope you don't mind.
okay...
and... Action!
that will break Edward's little heart.
edward has nothing to do with this!
he does... His rage will leave for more interesting sporthings...
than this feeble attempt to protect you.
and let's continue.
beautiful... Very visually dynamic.
I chose my stage well.
it's too bad he didn't have the strength to turn you.
instead he kept you this fragile little human.
it's cruel, really.
tell him to avenge you.
tell him to avenge you! Tell him!
Edward, don't!
tell him!
you're alone... 'cause you're faster than the others...
but not stronger.
I'm strong enough to kill you.
I'm sorry.
Bella, Bella! It's okay.
son...
enough! Remember who you are.
Bella needs you.
Oh God.
Carlisle! The blood...
your brothers will take care of it.
start the fire with the floor boards.
Alice! -Alice, go. Alice!
her femoral artery has been savaged. She's losing too much blood.
no, no, my hand... Is burning!
it's the venom.
you have to make a choice to prevent the change happen.
no...
No!
it's gonna happen, Edward. I've seen it.
it doesn't have to be that way.
she'd still have what she has.
make me a tourniquet with your belt.
Carlisle, what's my other option?
tie it above my hands.
go.
to try to suck the venom out.
you know I won't be able to stop.
then find the will... To stop.
but choose. She only has minutes left.
I can't make you go away, Bella.
but I'll make it go away.
Edward, stop!
the blood is clean, you're killing her.
Edward, stop!
stop. Find the will.
dead is peaceful... Easy...
life is harder.
baby?
mom...
hey...
where is he? Where's... Where is Edward?
he's asleep.
he never leaves.
and your dad is down at the cafeteria.
what happened?
well, when you fell you broke your leg.
and you lost a lot of blood.
you don't remember any of this, do you?
edward came down with his dad to try to convince to come back to Forks.
so you went over to their hotel and you tripped...
and fell down two flights of stairs...
and through a window!
Yeah, it sounds like me.
Oh, honey. I'm so sorry.
it's Phil.
he's so worried about you.
you're texting...?
finally, yeah.
I told him to stay down in Florida.
Oh, honey. You are gonna love Jacksonville. It's sunny everyday day.
and we found the cutest little house and you've got your own bathroom.
no, Mom. I still wanna live in Forks.
what?
I wanna live in Forks.
well, okay. We'll talk about it.
do you mind getting dad?
I have to talk to him. Apologize.
okay, baby.
I'll go get him.
and I'll go get a nurse, okay?
okay.
what happened? Where is James?
we took care of him.
and the woman, Victoria, she ran off.
I'm alive because of you.
no, you're in here because of me.
the worst part of it was...
I thought I wasn't gonna be able to stop.
you did stop.
Bella, you gotta go to Jacksonville, -so I can't hurt you anymore.
what?
no, no!
I don't even know what you're...? What are you talking about?
you want me to go away? I can't just leave you...
I know.
we can't be apart. You can't leave me.
I'm here.
okay. You just can't just say stuff like that to me. Ever.
where else am I gonna go?
Alice lent me the dress.
the cast is...
perfect.
I'll take care of her, Chief Swan.
Uhu. I've heard that before.
Hey, Bells. I put a new can of Pepper spray on your bag.
dad...
and, um...
you look beautiful.
Thanks.
see you.
Hey. Be right back.
Hey!
nice.
you too.
are you crashing the prom or something? Did you come with a date?
no.
my dad paid me to come talk to you.
twenty bucks.
let's hear it.
just don't get mad, okay?
he wants you to break up with your boyfriend.
he's just ... He said, -quote:
we'll be watching you.
okay. Well, tell him thanks. -Okay...
and to pay up. -Okay.
Oh, let me help you. -Jacob. Jacob.
I'll take it from here.
I guess I'll see you around, Bella.
I leave you alone for two minutes and the wolves descend.
I can't believe you're making me do this.
smile.
Wow! You are really trying to kill me.
prom is an important rite of passage.
I don't want you to miss anything.
you wanna go?
Yeah.
shall we?
you're serious?
Oh, why not?
see? You're dancing.
at Prom...
Edward, why did you save me?
if you just had let the venom spread...
I could be like you right now.
you don't know what you're saying.
you don't want this.
I want you. Always.
I'm not gonna end your life for you.
I'm dying... Already.
every second I get closer... Older.
that's the way it's supposed to be.
Alice said that she saw me like you. I heard her.
her visions change.
Yeah, but someday people decide.
I've decided.
is that what you dream about?
becoming a monster?
I dream about being with you forever.
forever...
are you ready right now?
Yes.
is it not enough just to have a long and happy life with me?
Yeah.
for now.
no one will surrender tonight.
I know what I want.
childhood is not from birth to a certain age.
at a certain age the child is grown and puts away childish things.
childhood is the kingdom where nobody dies.
Jake! Jacob!
Phil!
it's happening.
you just have to break them in.
I've been breaking them in for 3 days.
can I just go barefoot? - No!
absolutely not!
I'm thinking it's just a little much, you know?
the dress and the shoes...
all of this.
no, it's exactly enough.
tomorrow will be perfect.
where you want 'em, boss?
on either side of the aisle.
what aisle? - Does no one have vision?
you! Go home and gets lots of beauty sleep.
that's an order.
OK...
I'm just checking for cold feet.
mine are toasty warm.
it's not too late to change your mind.
you're having second thoughts?
you are?
I've waited a century to marry you, Ms. Swan.
But?
But?
I haven't told you everything about myself.
what? You're not a virgin?
you can't scare me away now.
a few years after Carlisle created me,
I rebelled against him.
I resented him for curbing my appetite.
for a while, I went off on my own.
I wanted to know how it felt to hunt.
to taste human blood, all the men I killed were monsters.
and so was I.
Edward, they were all murderers.
you've probably saved more lives than you've took.
Bella, that's what I've told myself but they were all human beings.
I looked into their eyes as they died and saw who I was.
and what I was capable of.
and what I'll be capable of.
why are you telling me this tonight?
do you really think this would change my mind about you?
I just wondered if it would change your mind about yourself.
and who you'll want see in the mirror a year from now.
I know I can do this.
let me tell you why, because you did.
you should give yourself some credit for that.
hopefully a year from now, I'll look in the mirror and see someone like you.
someone capable of courage, sacrifice, and love.
what is that? - Come on! Let's go
I'm late for my bachelor party.
send him out Bella, or we're coming in after him.
so this party, will there be strippers?
no, just a couple of mountain lions.
maybe a few bears.
don't worry Bella, we'll get him back in plenty of time.
OK go, before they break my house.
I'll meet you at the altar.
I'll be the one in white.
that's very convincing.
what did I say about beauty sleep?
sorry. Bad dream.
maybe it's wedding jitters.
do you need some help?
I can do her hair.
Really?
please. I'm not offended by your choice of groom.
just my blatant lack of respect for mortality, essentially.
weddings, they bring everyone together!
Hey, Phil, did you find our daughter?
are those graduation caps?
Hah! How creative!
or weird. - Alice? Bella?
in here, Mom.
Oh my gosh! You're so beautiful!
crap! My mascara.
Thanks!
Charlie, get in here!
you sure? I don't wanna ...
I know. I look hot.
we've thought you needed something blue and something old, besides your mother. - Ah, nice...
it was grandma Swan's. - But we added the sapphires.
it's beautiful you guys!
Wow. Thank you so much.
it's your first family heirloom.
pass it on to your daughter, and her daughter.
mom, I love it.
No! No smudging my masterpiece!
she's right.
thank you.
it's time for the dress!
do you want to see it? - I wanna see!
they've got to be related.
what a gene pool!
seriously.
you've got some drool.
so, do you think Bella will be showing?
Jess, she is not pregnant.
okay! Who else gets married at 18?
ready?
yeah...
just don't let me fall, Dad.
never.
ladies and gentlemen, we're gathered here on this glorious day to witness the union of Edward Cullen and Bella Swan.
please repeat after me.
I, Edward Cullen.
I, Edward Cullen.
take you, Bella Swan.
take you, Bella Swan.
to have and to hold.
to have and to hold.
for better or for worse.
for richer or for poorer.
in sickness and in health.
to love.
to cherish.
as long as we both shall live.
I do.
I do.
I love you.
I love you.
I just thought it would be bigger.
hi guys.
we were just saying how pretty everything is. We were all just saying.
thanks so much. You don't think it's too much?
No! Not at all.
hey man! Nice to see you.
I'm happy for you. - Thank you!
I hope you'll be happy, Bella.
thank you, Billy.
have you heard from him?
I'm sure Jake wishes you the best.
well, I plan on getting drunk.
they're serving some pretty fancy champagne. Sue, can I get you a glass?
sparkling is fine with her.
sounds great.
Bella!
Congratulations! - Thank you.
eleazar and Carmen, right?
and these are cousins from Alaska. Tanya and Kate.
we've heard so much about you!
welcome to the family.
thank you.
Irina.
come meet Bella.
I can't do this. - You've promised.
they've invited one...
Irina, he is our friend.
they killed Laurent.
he tried to kill Bella.
I don't believe that! He wanted to be like us.
to live in peace with humans, with me.
I'm sorry.
Irina!
let's not monopolize the bride.
Congratulations! - Thank you.
sorry.
what's a wedding without family drama?
excuse me. Is this on?
Hello!
I'd like to propose a toast, to my new sister.
Bella, I hope you've got enough sleep these last 18 years cause you won't be getting anymore for a while.
Bella was just like everybody else totally mesmerized by Edward or "The Hair" as I called him.
and then suddenly, Edward is all about Bella.
although she's not captain of the volleyball team.
I'm just kidding.
or the president of the Student Council.
edward will be a good husband.
I know this because... I'm a cop.
I know things.
like how to hunt somebody till the ends of the earth.
now that you're my sister...
you have to get over your aversion to fashion.
and I know how to use a gun.
skirts, heels, and handbags.
go to sleep, my love.
go to sleep.
when you wake, you'll see me.
I'd like to thank Renee and Charlie for bringing such a wonderful person into the world and into our lives.
we'll cherish and protect her forever.
it's an extraordinary thing to meet someone who you can bare your soul to.
they'll accept you for what you are.
I've been waiting what seems like a very long time to get beyond what I am.
with Bella, I feel like I can finally begin.
so I'd like to propose a toast to my beautiful bride.
no measure of time with you will be long enough, but let's start with forever.
another of your gifts has just arrived.
what?
come on...
what's a wedding present doing in here?
it's a little more private.
the best man didn't have time to get a tux.
Jacob!
Jacob.
Hey!
hey Bella. - Hey.
it was kind of you.
kind is my middle name.
I'll see if Rosalie wants to dance.
I'm sorry I'm late.
it doesn't matter.
everything is perfect now.
dance with me?
where have you been?
we were gonna put your face on a milk carton.
mostly northern Canada, I think.
it's weird to be back on two legs again, with clothes.
I fell out of practice with the whole human thing.
are you okay, being here?
Why? Afraid I'll trash your party?
you're not the only one.
you'd think I'd be used to telling you goodbye by now.
come on, you're not supposed to be the one crying, Bella.
everyone cries at weddings.
this is how I'll remember you.
pink cheeks.
two left feet.
heart beat.
so what, soon I'm gonna be dead to you?
no.
I'm sorry.
I'm trying to appreciate your last night as human.
it's not my last night.
what? I thought you...
I didn't really wanna spend my honeymoon writhing in pain.
what's the point?
it's not like you're gonna have a real honeymoon with him.
it will be as real as any other.
that's a sick joke.
you're joking?
what? While you're still human?
you can't be serious. Bella, tell me you're not that stupid.
I mean it's really none of your business.
no, you can't do this. - Jake...
listen to me, Bella. - Let me go!
jacob, calm down.
are you out of your mind? Huh? You'll kill her!
Jake, walk away.
enough, Jacob!
stay out of this, Sam.
you're not gonna start something that we'll have to finish.
she'll die! - She's not our concern anymore.
let's go, Seth!
I'm really stupid. - No, it's alright.
they probably miss us. Let's go back.
he won't tell you where he's taking you?
no, it's surprise.
well, wear a hat and use sunscreen.
take care. - I will.
OK.
I love you, Bella.
I love you!
so much.
thank you.
everything is packed and ready to go.
cool.
I'll go see him. - Yeah.
dad...
well...
it's gonna be strange, you're not living under my roof.
yeah...
it will be strange for me, too.
you know it'll always be your home, right?
I love you, Dad.
forever.
I love you too, Bella.
I always have and always will.
alright...
go on. Don't want to miss your plane wherever it's going.
OK...
goodbye.
ready?
Yeah, I'm ready.
we're not staying in Rio de Janeiro?
no, just passing through.
are we close?
that's Isle Esme.
it was a gift from Carlisle.
is this totally necessary?
I'm nothing if not traditional.
want to take a look around?
are you tired?
want a swim?
Yeah, sounds nice.
I need a few minutes as a human.
don't take it too long, Mrs. Cullen.
OK.
OK...
Alice!
don't be a coward.
you're so beautiful!
I promise that we'd try, but if this doesn't work...
I trust you.
it's OK.
Bella, you're hurt
what?
no, Bella. Look.
I can't tell you how sorry I am.
I'm not.
really, I'm not. I'm fine...
don't say you're fine.
just don't.
no, you don't!
don't ruin this.
I've already ruined it.
why can't see you how perfectly happy I am?
or was, five seconds ago.
now I'm sorta pissed off actually.
well, you should be angry with me.
we knew this was going to be tricky, right?
I think we did amazing.
it was amazing for me.
that's what you're worried about?
that I didn't enjoy myself?
I know it's not the same for you but for a human... I can't imagine it gets better.
last night was the best night of my existence.
it was the best.
you're not gonna touch me again, are you?
you know that's not what I meant.
let me make you breakfast.
I win.
Bella.
you having a nightmare?
no.
it was just a dream.
it was a really good dream.
then why are you crying?
I wanted it to be real.
tell me.
Bella, I can't.
please...
please...
maybe they'll say she was in a car crash or tripped and fell off a cliff.
at least, I'll get one thing out of it.
no you won't.
the Cullens are not a danger to the town or tribe.
he will kill her or change her.
and the treaty says... - I say, Jacob.
I say.
you know if you wanted things different, you should've become Alpha.
turning it down seemed like a good idea at the time.
Jake, you really think you could kill Bella if she comes back as a vampire?
no. He would make one of us do it, then hold a grudge against...
shut up, Leah.
would you just get over it?
it's not like you imprinted on her.
at least they seem happy.
Yeah. Some people are just lucky, I guess.
lucky?
none of them belong to themselves anymore.
and the sickest part is?
their genes tell them they're happy.
at least if you imprinted on someone, you'll finally forget Bella.
I mean, being any kind of happy is better than being miserable about someone you can't have.
Bella, these are our housekeepers, Gustavo and Kaure.
this is my wife, Bella.
nice to meet you.
guess, we should just leave them to it.
what was that about?
she's afraid of you.
Why?
because I have you here all alone.
wait, she knows about you?
she suspects.
she's native Ticuna.
they have legends of blood drinking demons who prey on beautiful women.
monster.
I've gone to the mainland to hunt, be back before you wake
you are late.
Bella.
don't come in here.
you don't need to see this.
in sickness and in health, remember?
it must have been the chicken.
will you grab my bag?
what is it?
how many days it has been since the wedding?
14, why?
will you tell me what's going on?
I'm late.
my period is late.
that's impossible.
can this happen?
Alice. - Bella, are you alright?
I'm not one hundred percent sure. - Why? What's wrong?
I just... - You just what?
Alice, what did you see? - Here's Carlisle.
Bella, what's going on?
I'm a little worried. Can vampires go into shock?
has anyone being harmed? - No.
I know it's impossible, but I think I'm pregnant.
Carlisle, I swear something just moved inside me.
is this even possible? - I don't know.
what is he saying?
the sooner she is here, the sooner we can find out what it is.
I need you to get to the mainland at once. - Yeah, I will.
well?
damn it...
Kaure is making sure that you're still alive.
what?
people have legends. She might have seen this before.
I will not let it hurt you.
Carlisle will get that thing out.
thing?
wait here while we load.
hello. - Rosalie.
Bella?
what's going on? - I need your help.
Hey, son.
what's going on?
Bella called him.
Hey, I haven't seen you in a while.
are you OK? - So you finally heard from Bella?
they've extended their trip.
it seems she caught a bug.
they wanna wait until she feels better before they travel.
she's sick...
Yeah, she told me not to worry, but she sounded...
I don't know, off.
she'll be okay, Charlie.
come on. Let's eat.
Jacob.
let it go...
is it true? - Hello, Jacob. How are you?
listen, just give it to me straight.
Jake, is that you?
she's here? - They came home 2 weeks ago.
Jake... I'm glad you came.
close enough. - What's your problem?
rose, it's okay.
you look terrible.
Yeah, it's nice to see you, too.
so are you going to tell me what's wrong with you?
rose, do you wanna help me up?
you did this!
I didn't know it was even possible.
what is it? - I'm not sure.
ultrasound and needles won't penetrate the embryo sack.
I can't see it either, and I can't see Bella's future anymore.
we've been researching legends, but there isn't much to go on.
what we do know is that it's strong and fast growing.
why haven't you done anything?!
take it out of her!
this is none of your business, dog!
Rose!
all this fighting isn't good for Bella. - The fetus isn't good for Bella.
say the word, Alice. "Baby." It's just a little baby.
possibly.
Carlisle, you've got to do something.
no.
it's not his decision, it's not any of yours.
jacob, I need to talk to you.
I always knew you would destroy her.
she thinks Carlisle can turn her at the last minute.
as he did with me and Esme.
can he? - The probability is slight.
if her heart fails...
look, Jacob, I need you to do something for me.
for her?
you have a connection with her that I'll never understand.
maybe you could talk to her, change her mind.
you could keep her alive.
and if I can't?
if she dies, you'll get what you've always wanted...
to kill me.
rose, I'm fine. Really.
so Edward sent you to come talk to me?
sort of...
though I can't figure out why he thinks you'd listen to me, I mean you never have before.
since when are you and Blondie BFF's?
rose understands what I want.
what are you thinking, Bella?
seriously.
I know this seems a scary thing, but it's not.
it's like this miracle or something.
I can feel him.
so it's a bouncing baby boy.
I'm sorry, I don't know. I should've brought blue balloons.
it's just a guess.
when I picture him I see a boy.
we'll see!
you won't. - Jake, I can do this.
I'm strong enough. - Come on!
you can spout that crap to your bloodsucker , but you don't fool me.
I can see what that thing is doing to you.
it's a killer, Bella! - You're wrong.
when you die, what was the point?
of me loving you, you loving him.
how's that right for anyone?
because I sure don't see it.
listen to me, Bella...
please.
just don't do this...
live, okay?
please.
Jake, everything will be okay.
Jake, don't go.
I know how this ends.
and I'm not sticking around to watch.
Jake, I can do this...
this is none of your business, dog!
Jake, don't go...
you did this...
everything is going to be okay...
the fetus isn't good for Bella.
I know how this ends.
...It's killing you.
Jake!!
is it true, Jacob?
it's growing fast.
it's unnatural!
dangerous!
monstrosity! Abomination!
on our land. We can't allow it!!
we have to protect the tribe!
what they've bred won't be able to control its thirst.
every human will be in danger.
we're ready. - We're underway!
now we must destroy it before it's born.
you mean, kill Bella?
her choice affects us all.
Bella's human. Our protection applies to her.
she's dying anyway!
we have real enemies to fight tonight.
tonight?
and you will fight with us, Jake.
I will not!
I am the grandson of Ephraim Black!
I'm the grandson of a chief!
I wasn't born to follow you or anyone else.
don't worry. They're not following us.
what do you think you're doing here?
I left Sam's pack. - Go home, Seth.
I won't stand behind him. - Oh, yes, you will!
I'm not kidding. Get out of here.
is that an order?
you gonna make me bow down, too?
I'm not ordering anyone.
I'm just going off on my own here, okay?
great!
and I've got your back. - No, you don't!
if Sam comes after Bella, are you really ready to fight your own brother?
your sister?
if it's the right thing to do.
whatever.
I'm gonna go give the Cullen's the heads up.
do what you want.
how cool is this?!
a two man pack!
two against the world. - You're getting on my nerves, Seth.
I'll shut up.
can do.
get ready.
they're coming for Bella.
they're not going to touch her.
agreed.
man, I can smell them all the way out here.
what the hell are you doing here?
I'm not going to let my little brother get himself killed.
go away, Leah! I'll take care of myself.
that you think so proves that you need a babysitter.
will both of you shut up?
Sam send you? - Sam doesn't even know I left.
I think he's just figured it out.
Jake...
I know what his plan is.
Sam's lost the element of surprise and he doesn't wanna take you on outnumbered.
so he's not gonna come at you head on.
he's got the place surrounded and he'll wait for an opportunity.
he won't get through without a fight.
no fights.
we won't be the ones to break the treaty. - The treaty is void.
at least in Sam's mind. - Not in ours.
Carlisle, no one's hunted for weeks.
we'll make do.
you've done us a great service, Jacob.
thank you.
I know they're out there somewhere, but I can't hear them anymore.
it's so quiet.
I've stopped hearing them, too, the second I decided to leave.
it's nice.
you know you can't stay here. - But I don't have any place...
I can't trust you with the Cullen's.
you hate them too much.
you don't even like me. - I don't have to.
I just have to follow you.
look, Seth doesn't want you here.
neither do I.
being unwanted isn't exactly a new thing to me.
look, I'll stay out of your way.
I'll do whatever you want, except go back to Sam's pack and be the pathetic ex-girlfriend he can't get away from.
you don't know how many times I wished I could imprint on someone.
anyone... just to break the connection.
alright...
I'm gonna do a perimeter around.
got my flank?
her rib is cracked, but they're no splinters.
it hasn't punctured anything.
yet... - Edward.
it's breaking her bones now.
it's crushing you from the inside out.
Carlisle, tell her what you told me.
tell her.
Carlisle, tell me.
it's alright.
the fetus isn't compatible with your body.
it's too strong.
it won't allow you to get the nutrition you need.
it's starving you by the hour, I can't stop it and I can't slow it down.
at this rate, your heart will give out before you can deliver.
then I'll hold on as long as I can and ... - Bella...
there are some conditions even venom can't overcome.
do you understand?
I'm sorry.
Edward, I'm sorry.
I can't live without you.
you won't. You'll have a part of me.
he'll need you.
do you honestly think I could love or even tolerate it, if it killed you?
it's not his fault.
you have to accept what it is. - Because you've given me no choice!
Bella, we're supposed to be partners, remember?
but you've decided this on your own.
you've decided to leave me.
don't see it that way. - Well I have no other way to see it.
cause it's me who'll lose you.
and I don't choose that.
I don't choose that.
are you cold?
I got it.
don't do that.
what?
smile like I'm your favorite person in the world.
you're one of them.
it feels complete when you're here, Jake.
we need to find a way to get some food into her system.
if only I could see the fetus, - Baby.
maybe I could figure out what it wants.
I think you might be right.
jacob just had an idea.
it wasn't an idea, it was a snide comment.
what were you thinking?
that it's probably just looking for someone to sink its teeth into.
he's thirsty?
I know the feeling.
if it's craving, it's not gonna want animal blood.
I have some Type O negative laid aside for Bella.
walk with me?
wait! Wait! Wait! You're going to make her drink that?
it's the fastest way to test the theory.
only if you're comfortable with it.
I'll try anything.
just hold on... I think I'm going to be sick.
it'll make it a little easier to take.
it tastes... good.
your pulse is already getting stronger.
it's working.
you sound better. - I am.
I feel much better.
this whole thing must have put a kink in the honeymoon, huh?
you could say that...
otherwise married life treating you OK?
edward still walks on water and all that?
Yeah, I mean it is different now.
the important thing is that you're better and that you're coming home soon. Right?
okay, Dad, I don't want you to freak out but... I'm going to a medical center in Switzerland.
What?! You're not going to Switzerland!
you said you were better! - I am.
no Bella, I'm getting on a plane.
No! It's really more of a ...a spa.
and I'm sure I'll be better before you got there.
I... uh... I don't know
dad, don't come.
picture me healthy.
like I'm sitting on the couch with you, eating pizza or something.
you want me to visualize?
they say it helps.
just picture me like that.
like I was.
it'll make me feel better.
dad, I gotta go. OK?
Bella...
I love you. - Bella...
sorry I've been so angry.
I would be too.
I've left you alone in this.
marriage.
they say the first year is the hardest.
what was that? - What?
I thought I've just heard.
just say something else...
like what?
Edward, what's going on?
he likes the sound of your voice.
you can hear him?
mind.
he likes my voice as well.
what?
what do you hear?
so strange...
I thought he was like me, but he's not, he's like you.
good and pure.
he's happy.
of course you are.
of course you're happy. How can you not be?
I love you so much!
what do you hear now?
he loves you, Bella.
Oh my gosh!
Jacob.
so that's the last of it?
Bella can deliver as early as tomorrow
if she's going to have any chance at all she'll need more blood.
you need to feed.
you have to be at your strongest for her. We need to go tonight.
Carlisle, you're the enemy now.
Sam won't hesitate. You will be slaughtered.
Emmett will come with us.
that won't be enough. - We have no choice, Jacob.
if there's anything we can do to save her, we have to try.
you would risk your lives for her?
of course we would.
Bella's part of our family now.
Yeah.
I can see that.
this really is a family.
as strong as the one I was born into.
I know what I have to do.
Jake, they're coming!
I know. - We should phase, Jacob.
we can't protect ourselves like this.
they'll see us as a threat.
I wanna talk!
be easier if I could hear you, too.
this isn't your territory anymore.
how's your new family working out?
you done?
you coming home, Jake?
not until I finish this.
what do you mean?
I want Sam to take back Leah and Seth.
what? - No way!
be quiet.
I want them safe and I want this over.
I need Sam to wait until Bella's been separated from the problem.
you mean until she's dead? - Ease up, Paul.
then what?
tell Sam that when the moment comes, I'll be the one to destroy it.
Jake!
I'm the only one who can.
they trust me.
you've played us!
thank you.
they make it out alright? - Yeah.
good.
hey...
are you OK?
Yeah, it's not like I'm not one carrying a demon.
this is pretty important, Bella.
why don't you tell Jacob what you've decided to?
what now?
rose is trying to talk Bella out of her baby names.
she hates them.
well then I'm on your side no matter what you pick.
they are not that bad.
if it's a boy, E. J. Edward Jacob.
fine, that one isn't awful.
why don't you tell him the girl's name?
I was playing around with our mom's names.
Renee and Esme.
I was thinking Renesmee.
R-Renesmee?
too weird?
it's not too weird.
it's beautiful!
and it's unique.
it certainly fits the situation.
I like Renesmee.
he likes it.
rosalie, pass the morphine.
Carlisle said that the placenta must have detached.
he's coming as fast as he can. - We'll have to do it.
rose, let the morphine spread.
there's no time. He's dying.
get him out now!
look at me, Bella.
rosalie, don't!
Alice, get her out of here!
Rosalie!
save her! You gotta change her! - I can't! Not whilst he's still in there.
I gotta get him out first.
stay focused. Keep your heart beating.
he's suffocating!
it's Renesmee!
you're beautiful!
Bella?
Bella?!
Bella?!
jacob, take the baby.
keep that away from me.
Edward.
I'll take care of her.
I promise I'm okay, let me.
what's that?
my venom.
it supposed to be working.
I won't kill you... that would be too easy.
you deserve to live with this.
she didn't make it...
you're not dead...
come on!
come on!
no. It will work.
please, please...
come back to me please...
Bella, please.
I don't care what he's done.
he's still my son.
I'm sorry, Billy.
I just thought you should know.
Bella is dead.
it killed her.
let's go!
it's like gravity, our whole center shifts.
suddenly, it's not the earth holding you here.
you would do anything, be anything she needs.
a Friend.
a Brother.
a Protector.
Alice! Jasper!
you'll be fine.
we're outnumbered. - By a lot.
I won't let them hurt my family.
stop! It's over.
if you kill her, you kill me.
jacob imprinted.
they can't hurt her.
whomever a wolf imprints on can't be harmed.
it's their most absolute law.
she shouldn't be so still.
it's the morphine.
maybe it was too late. - No, Edward.
listen to her heart.
it's from Carlisle.
which is spelled with an "S" sweet Bianca.
he's added a new member to his coven.
increasing his power.
first it's the spelling and the grammar.
at least our dispute with the Cullens is over.
over?
goodness no...
our dispute goes far beyond the fate of a mere human.
and what might it be?
I thought you understood
they have something I want.
Paris, Two Thousand Ten.
faced with rampant crime in certain suburbs, or barrios, the government authorized the construction of an isolation wall around cities classified as high risk.
they ain't ready yet.
OK. They're ready. Help yourself. Go on.
I must have an effect on you fags, huh?
I step outtake my car, and you're already hot to trot.
we don't want no shit here, K Two.
whaddya talking about. It's just a friendly visit that's all it is.
sniff... Smells good here too
Merguez?
delicious!
want some?
so... is your boss around?
we ain't seen him today.
that's okay. I don't mind waiting.
C'mon relax. Go on, search me. I ain't armed clean as a choir boy.
look, we don't want no shit. You better go back.
what's with you guys? We can't communicate for once we're together, and y'get all nervous and shy.
so get movin', will ya?
we don't feel like talkin' The boss ain't here.
we told ya. If you want, we'll tell him you were.
that's really nice of you
anyone got a piece of paper? I'll leave him a number.
no, I'll write it on the wall. Won't get lost that way.
nothing on the wall.
Oh I forgot. This is Mister Clean's apartment building.
real fancy guy your boss is, huh?
Yeah, it hurts you to see a building still standing in this shithouse of a city.
I think it's great.
it makes the city more lively.
so, where do I write the number?
gimme your hand.
gimme your hand,
I said. If I was gonna cut you, I'd a done it a long time ago.
look at him, armed to the teeth, and he's scared of a pen.
don't worry man about it. I'm not gonna press hard.
why do you wanna see Leito?
he's got some stuff I want.
things that belong to me.
there you go. Now, you got a good reason not to wash.
now that was a nice friendly visit.
why don't we shake on it, huh?
what's your name?
Tarik.
Tarik, let's shake. That's better. Don't be afraid.
this is worth a picture. I wish I had my camera.
right guys? Smile, come on.
it's okay. They're with me.
so you feel like talkin' all of a sudden, but it's too late.
you go up the stairs. I'll take the elevator
for once, it's not broken.
call downstairs, the elevator's coming.
you could do it yourself, you know.
Tarik, who's comin' up?
Tarik!
fuckin' thing never works right.
hey move it, we got visitors.
look, if I don't watch the end, I won't be able to follow tomorrow.
Tarik, would you say somethin'?
Tarik!
Tarik. - The picture's gone. Hurry, fix the antenna!
Hey, I ain't your nigger.
you do it man.
Tarik, will you answer me!
you're too worked up man. It's probably the food being delivered.
that's bullshit. Since when do they deliver an hour early, huh?
you're such a pessimist.
Leito's apartment, you wouldn't know the number huh?
it's fourteen.
Thanks.
son of a bitch! There ain't no numbers on the doors!
get 'em all opened!
I'm lookin' for Leito.
it's not here, I swear!
then tell me where it is, asshole!
down the hall and left. He got his name on the door.
you're coming with me.
I don't trust signs.
go right...
left...
the third door.
What're ya tryin' to do, get me killed?
alive, remember? Taha wants him alive.
move over...
on three, huh?
catch the bastard!
get it open!
come on!
the roof, hurry!
the stupid fuck!
there he is!
stop me if I'm wrong.
you get ripped off twenty kilos of power.
at nine, you know who did it, and you go to get it back.
how many were ya?
ten, twelve.
ten, twelve huh?
and about noon, seven of you come back empty-handed.
anything else?
well, we coulda iced the guy, but you wanted him alive so...
that's fantastic. Before long, it'll be my fault.
that's not what I wanted to say. He's like... a...
like a bar of soap, he's...
Oh, is that so?
well, yeah.
let's see, fifty a gram, twenty kilos.
don't bother counting. It's a million, in euros.
that's very expensive soap, huh?
so, which one of you has a suggestion for me so he doesn't slip away again?
me! Me, I uhh I got an idea.
K Two, that's great. Go on.
well, since it was Leito who dumped all the dope, then he's gotta give us the cash for it.
that's just common sense.
I asked you for an idea.
wait, hold on!
go on.
his sister Lola.
Leito's sister works at the supermarket. If we've got her, he won't stay in hiding for long.
that's what I call an idea. Go and get her.
we'll be right out.
come on, the boss wants to see you.
the boss is waiting, I said. You heard, so get off your ass...
he never comes in on Tuesdays.
I'm not talkin' about that scumbag. I mean my boss and yours Taha.
taha can go fuck himself.
let's me go!
let's me go.
what the fuck is wrong with everyone today?
hey K Two, is she my birthday present?
I'd love a piece of her. She looks just my size!
watch your hands.
Hey, we gotta search her. Huh?
we already did. She's clean.
C'mon, share the wealth. Leave us her panties.
when I come back, I'll bite your balls off!
I got other plans for you mouth.
you'll like it a lot more.
that's for openers, slimeball!
hands off her I said. She's for Taha.
and you cut that shit out, okay?
it's me.
K Two is here.
I know your face. Show me the girl.
okay, bring her up here.
make sure he knows we got his sister.
spread the news.
I wish I could see the cocksucker when they tell him what happened.
you're lookin' at him now, you son of a bitch.
why don't I cut you now and that'll be the end of it.
cut me and there's a pack of wild dogs that're gonna be out a master, and that might not be too cool. What're you after?
you see Taha, that's the difference between us two.
you never know what's in my head, but I know all the shit going on in yours.
I'm always a step ahead because I know what you're thinking.
hold it, K Two. It's okay.
stay nice and calm. We're just talkin'.
Yeah, just talkin'.
look, tell me what the fuck you want.
stop busting my balls and let's get this over with.
two things.
Yeah, go on.
Y'leave my building alone. No dealing for five hundred meters around it.
yeah okay. What else?
that's easy. Your life for my sister's.
I let you go.
I walk out with her, and if none of your guys move, we got a deal.
y'know, you shoulda gone into business.
yes or no?
okay, it's a deal.
I got your word?
she ain't enough?
give the order.
K two, let her go.
you heard me. Wait downstairs.
K Two, will ya stop your fuckin' thinking and do what I'm tellin' ya to do?
get down now or you'll never get up again!
look, I kept my word. She's free, so now let go of me.
patience, Taha.
y'think you're gonna get outta here in one piece?
y'think every here is your buddy huh?
listen,
I got a deal with this guy, okay?
I said that he and his sister could go.
and so make sure nobody moves, and everything'll be cool.
hey you...
open your mouth.
chew it, pig! C'mon, eat me!
she's my kinda girl.
you can't have her. Go on.
move it!
let's go!
okay, let's go.
clear the way. C'mon, move it. This way. Faster.
Hey, get rid of this fuckin' thing. Hurry. Move it.
go on! Go on, move!
stop your vehicle. Stop your vehicle.
okay, hold it. We brought you a customer.
we want the inspector.
make way for us. We're comin' in.
son of a bitch.
Hey, can't you settle your scores someplace else, 'cause we're closing up here.
it's Taha. Taha Ben Mamoud.
doesn't the name mean something to you?
I know him, but I told you we're closing up by order of the government.
so if you can't show me some proof, I can't do anything.
five kilos of heroin taken from off his desk, with two wit nesses.
how's that?
there are too many of them outside. We're outnumbered.
okay okay, since you insist, but first your weapons.
hand 'em over, and you men, keep your eye on Taha.
Oh, poor na? Ve Leito.
I'll bet you really think it's gonna change something, don't you?
maybe not much, but you gotta start somewhere.
now we're gonna eliminate the paperwork, okay?
you go into the cell, and you go pick up your dope and clear out.
don't that for Chrissake!
if you let him go, it'll be worse than before.
it won't be worse 'cause we're getting out.
when the shit falls, we'll be far away.
you won't be here, but it's still gonna go on, and you're the ones who're supposed to stop it.
I'll bet that you still believe that.
the barbed wire and the walls, did you forget that?
they're gonna put a lid on it and blow it all up.
that's what they'll do to make the shit disappear.
as for you, be grateful you're here 'cause there are some guys outside ready to make dead meat out of you.
why the hell are you still here?
like you said, there are a lotta guys out there all ready to do what I tell'em to.
stop that shit, Taha. You're free. Y'got your dope.
what the hell more do y'want?
the girl.
No! No!
now get out.
No!
I'm warning you, touch me and you'll...
Lola! Lola!
don't worry. I'll take good care of her.
gentlemen, it's always a pleasure to do business with you.
so long.
no, no!
take her to my office, tie her up, and give her two grams.
that'll calm her down.
okay, okay, let's get back to work now.
I didn't have any choice, kid.
I've been in this area for fifteen years.
I'm retired as of tonight, and I'd like to take advantage of it.
it was her or me. I'm sorry.
you shoulda chose my sister. You're already dead.
six Months Later
Digame Pedro, what you got against my car?
my name's not Pedro.
who gives a fuck your name's not Pedro? I'm talkin' about my car, cojone.
what if I crashed your head in every time I wanted you to keep quiet?
Hey, it's only a car.
no, it's not only a car. It's my car, maricon.
I just had it overhauled, and it cost a fortune.
so I suggest you show some fucking respect for my car or you'll find yourself under the wheels.
Comprende?
forget it Carlos. He didn't do it on purpose.
C'mon, what the fuck's the matter with that guy, huh?
I'm sick of these kids who don't respect anything.
anybody can close a door without slamming it.
it's okay, he's gonna take good care of your car from now on. Right Pedro?
my name's not Pedro.
what's more, the door's got a squeak.
the garage takes a fortune and gives me back the car with a squeaky fucking door!
I'll get rid of the squeaking, Carlos. I promise you.
we gotta recruit better, Benito. It's getting bad.
remind me to talk to Frank.
okay.
I'm tired of getting all these Portuguese guys.
sawdust in the head. Campesinos.
I'll talk to Frank about it. Don't worry.
I want men with an education, damn it.
hire good prospects as soon as they get outta school.
guys who wanna use their brains instead of hanging out all day.
benito, there are six million unemployed in this fuckin' country.
two or three shouldn't be so fuckin' hard to find.
Yeah, Frank'll get us some good men, that's for sure.
well, what're ya standin' there for?
very good.
place your bets.
twenty seven.
you won't forget me Carlos?
no problem Mr. Keijman.
end of the week, as usual, huh?
Hijo de puta. He's got balls that asshole, huh?
Remindin' me about his kickback with all the money he owes us.
people got no education nowadays, Benito.
get downstairs!
Hola. Que tal?
everything okay, Sammy?
no, things are pretty terrible.
Oh yeah? What's wrong now?
everyone you see is a cop.
one there, and two there.
they've already spent an hour choosing a can of corn.
they're perverts.
perverts? What're they doing in the food section?
you got here at one ten, and outside, look what's happening now.
what's that?
perverts, and I don't think they're gonna spend hours looking for corn.
anything else suspicious?
Yeah, most of our regular players didn't show up tonight, and it just happens to be the day we transfer our money.
Yeah, and so you're saying...
...that a real big transfer can be very tempting.
all you have to do is put the cops onto the deal, and you get ten percent of the money with no risk.
how d'you know that anyway?
cause I've already been offered it.
you must've been tempted.
how can you be sure it was a real cop who approached you?
you're pretty clever, huh?
it's the only way to stay alive.
that's for sure.
you went to school, right?
economics.
bachelor's degree.
Yeah, I was right. Y'see the difference?
so somebody's tryin' to rob us, huh?
and rob us big time.
didn't I tell you that that Pedro guy was pretty fuckin' weird?
Hijo de puta.
his name wasn't Pedro.
who cares what his name was? I ain't puttin' up any monument huh?
okay, grab all the money and let's go.
no one's goin' anywhere. Sacks down, hands up, huh?
benito, what're ya doing?
I'm not Benito anymore. The name's Damien.
first Attack Division Carlos Montoya. You're under arrest, you hear?
benito, you've gotta...
you have the right to remain silent.
whatever you say can be used against you.
any threatening gesture or false movement will be considered as a refusal to cooperate thus putting my agents in a position of self defense. Clear?
what does all that shit mean?
it means one false move, and I paint the place red, Capito?
yeah yeah. And how do ya think you're gonna get outta here in one piece?
we're gonna stick around here some more.
Sammy, you and your friends clear out.
why the hell did ya let them go?
because you're the big one.
chameleon in place. Are you guys all set?
we are Chameleon. Here it comes.
what do we do now?
what are you asking me for?
you went to school.
C'mon, enough of that.
what's goin' on?
you okay? Nothing broken?
no no, I'm okay.
glad to hear it.
chameleon to carrier. The delivery's ready.
commencing operation.
okay, c'mon out of there Sir, please.
what now Einstein?
step on it. It's getting hot over here.
the wire damn it.
Hey, you better send me some ammo and quick.
they didn't take the money. Go on, shut the door.
go on, they're waiting for you.
what a great sense of timing you guys go.
okay guys, go go go go. Come on!
this way. This way please, everyone.
just keep moving. C'mon. - Come on, come on man. Easy does it.
good job.
captain.
you're the fuckin' biggest son of a bitch I ever met, you scumbag!
that's the first compliment I've had all day.
when I think I trusted you like a brother.
a brother?
you mean like washing your car for six months before giving me a real job?
Oh, that door of yours, the one that squeaks?
it doesn't squeak anymore.
it's Captain Tomasso, Colonel.
thank you. Show him in.
hello Damien.
I'd have much preferred simply to congratulate you for last night's operation.
unfortunately however, we have a real emergency. Sit down.
I'd rather stand if it's okay with you.
as you like.
you know Mr. Kruger, the Secretary of State for Defense, and Mr. Corsini, his assistant.
they need a man of courage for an extremely delicate mission.
Mr. Kruger, I'll let you explain the situation.
it happened yesterday. In the afternoon, we were transferring material in an armored vehicle when we had what you might call a little incident.
no no no no no no!
I don't want your dirty sponge. It'll scratch the windows.
shit!
the good news is that the vehicle had a lot of tracers in it, so we know exactly where it's located, and we're asking you to get it back.
where is it?
what's inside of the truck?
what is this shit anyway.
an experimental scatter type bomb, sometimes known as a clean bomb.
it's a prototype based on neutron technology.
medium range, about eight kilometers.
the waves are of short duration and are absorbed very fast.
the risk of polluting the atmosphere is close toi zero.
you're worried they'll move the bomb.
is that it? It wouldn't be so clean in the center of town, would it?
Yes, and that's one of our primary concerns.
what's more, the bomb is equipped with a timing mechanism set for twenty four hours.
unfortunately, it was triggered accidentally, and that was exactly an hour ago.
Y'mean that in twenty three hours, it'll...
it'll explode.
K TWO. - Yeah?
Y'got twenty four hours to sell this mother.
can't be done. Too short.
captain, we're not asking for your advice on this.
we're trying to explain your mission to you.
Colonel, you know the way I function.
I study the terrain for weeks and weeks.
then it takes me months to infiltrate.
Damien, there are two million people there, and maybe half are the scum of the earth, but the other half are entitled to our assistance.
so you're gonna change how you operate, unless you don't care anymore about saving innocent people.
but accepting a mission that's a lost cause is totally crazy.
you want me to defuse a bomb in the worst barrio,
where I've never even been. Couldn't be more attractive.
as far as the site goes, we've found you a local guide.
plus I've gotta work with someone.
he's a young man who was born there, and he knows the barrio like a book, so he'll save a lot of precious time.
and the guy, did you force him to do it, or is he a volunteer?
he doesn't know yet. We're counting on you to convince him.
leito, transfer.
where to?
shut up.
prisoner 712, in the van.
let me go! Let me go, godammit!
come on, get up!
prisoner 713 in the van.
fuck, he bit me, the asshole!
you okay?
never better.
the fucker thought I'd let him kick the shit outta me without doin' anything.
I'm gettin' outta here.
you think playing around with the lock is really gonna open the door?
you say that because y'don't know who I am yet. The name's Phantoman.
and Phantoman doesn't plan spending eight years locked up.
What'd they get you for?
I blew away five guys, buy they weren't the right ones. The guy I wanted got away.
What'd ya want him for?
he murdered my father and my two brothers.
and it hurts to know this guy is still breathing.
so soon as I'm outta here I head for Barrio Thirteen and finish the bastard off for good.
does he live there?
Yeah, and he's gonna die there.
what's the guy's name?
Taha. Y'know him?
you're not missing much.
I made the big mistake of trying to do some business with the guy.
he lives in a kind of hangar with an army protecting him.
and he struts around the place. Him and his human vegetable.
what human vegetable?
a junky. He keeps her on a leash like a dog or something.
Lola's her name, I think
I'll be back in two minutes flat.
Hey, there's a space here in front.
can I drop you somewhere?
barrio Thirteen'll be fine.
you got it.
Damien.
Leito.
okay, they've left the prison.
the plan's going according to schedule.
are they still together?
Yes, they're in the front of the van. It shouldn't be hard to spot them.
excellent. Congratulations Colonel.
I wouldn't claim victory so quickly.
it's much easier to get out of prison than it is to enter Barrio Thirteen.
and that is when we'll see how good a guide your Leito is,
because without him, Damien's going to be out of luck.
your captain can take care of himself.
I'm gonna need your help because I don't know the way.
any idea how we can sneak in discreetly?
Yeah. Go straight.
Hey, cut that shit out. What're ya doing?
I won't lose you this way.
take those fucking things off me!
you wanna get inside?
Yeah.
then from now on asshole, I'm Phantoman, and you're gonna do whatever I want.
now floor it, huh?
what do I do now?
go on, straight ahead.
okay, turn right, now.
turn right I said!
Hey, I heard you the first time, but the wheel won't turn.
okay, stop the car.
the brakes are gone too!
then stop it against another car, but go easy.
I didn't say to smash the car.
okay sorry, I did the best I could, but no one's stopping you from getting a new driver.
now let me go, huh?
what's wrong? You should feel at home, man.
What're you talkin' about?
you're a cop, and a cop who thinks I'm an idiot doesn't live long.
C'mon Leito, let me go, y'hear?
this is where you wanted me to take you.
okay, so you're here.
now take out your police manual and look at the page that says, "I'm up shit's creek
leito, I'm not a cop for Chrissakes.
Yeah, I wonder why you did that. Somebody needed me to be set free.
but whatever the deal, count me out.
even if it's to save your sister?
she doesn't need anyone except her brother.
[Man narrating] It was easier in the past.
a man knew what it was to be a man.
you stood up for things that were wrong.
you had the right to do so.
you were expected to do so.
the way you lived, the training you put yourself through, prepared you for the inevitable confrontations, ones that could end in dismemberment or even death.
then something happened.
we passed laws of decency.
lawyers became our shepherds.
and what was once a fairly easy thing to understand became muddled in the bureaucracy of what we call being civilized.
a man could no longer stand up to the wrongs that were around him.
he had to go through courts and lawyers and trudge through miles of red tape.
women demanded equality, and she got it.
not by getting everything the man had, but by the man being castrated in the form of order.
I don't care what you say.
that's not progress.
it's not evolution.
it's a disease, and it needs someone that understands what's at stake.
someone who can stand up like a real man Today.
right now.
before lunch.
number one for the office mascot.
number two for Miss Congeniality.
number three for "the early bird gets the worm.
four for the master brownnoser.
number five for the ungrateful backstabber.
and last but not least, number six...
number six...
just do it.
you can do it.
just do it.
Maconel
Shelby wants this by Friday, okay?
and make sure there's nothing missing this time.
friday, Maconel. [rapping on computer]
make it happen.
it's all about timing.
nothing worthwhile is done without it.
my time will come.
Bob?
um, my husband's brother's family's coming into town next weekend and I was just kind of wondering maybe if there's any possibility you could do your yard?
I'll see what I can do.
that'd be great. Thanks.
[Male voice] Chickened out again, didn't you?
I didn't chicken out.
I just didn't think the timing was right.
[Male voice] Oh, right. Yeah. Uh-huh.
the timing again.
Hey, buddy, I think I've heard that one before.
you should be happy I didn't do it today.
cause if I did, who'd be here to feed you, huh?
Hey, who cares about food, as long as those goddamn bastards die, right?
huh? They die.
fuck 'em.
Hey. Hey, that's mine.
[Man on radio] Now, what exactly is your fear about these chickens?
[Man #2 on radio] Well, the fear exactly of bird flu and the diseases.
and then-- Pow! I mean, we could all die.
well, I think that's just a bit extreme.
check.
love the hula girl.
how's that recount coming?
you said Friday. That's tomorrow.
tomorrow morning. I'd like to see it before then.
Why? You won't be able to tell if I missed anything.
look, I am not going through this with you again.
come on, Harper, I wanna get a table with a view.
I already reserved one.
cool. Hey, what's this?
Hey, that's mine. Put it down.
come on. What's it do?
give it back. Put it down.
maybe it turns on his brain. Give it back.
give it back. That's mine!
what's the button do? Blow up the entire world!
give it back. Give it back.
let it go.
fine, take your stupid toy. Hey.
I need that list done by 5 P. M. sharp.
I'll let you have the honors today.
Hey, hula man.
hope you didn't break her heart too.
check.
Yeah, you're sorry. Sorry you got caught.
I thought you were somebody else.
Oh, so I'm not the only one you're harassing.
I'm not harass
I have to deliver these.
I catch you looking at me like that again,
I'm taking it upstairs.
you know, they have rules to protect women from men like you!
Mr. Harper?
Maconel!
you are so lucky you didn't go home.
I wasn't going home.
then where were you?
I told you I wanted that list by 5.
that's why I brought them up to your office, but you weren't there.
of course I wasn't there.
I was down here looking for you.
I thought you wanted me to deliver them.
you thought.
you thought?
give me this.
you didn't staple it?
I used a paper clip.
well, that was really smart, wasn't it?
Hey, Harp. Shelby wants you in on this conference call.
okay.
staple those together and wait in your cube until I get back.
we're not done with this.
there comes a time in order to save the herd.
one for the office mascot.
number two for Miss Congeniality.
number three for "the early bird gets the worm.
four for the master brownnoser.
number five for the ungrateful backstabber.
and last but not least, number six...
number six...
just do it.
just do it.
just do it.
Oh, shit.
Maconel!
I told that drone not to leave.
Hey, anybody seen Maconel?
Coleman?
Maconel.
Ralf, look at what you did.
Yeah.
how did it feel?
satisfying.
Christ. Coleman?
shit. Shit.
I think that's your cue to leave.
[Scoffs] You don't kill this many people and simply walk away.
no trial. [gun clicks]
no trial.
Oh, my God, it's Vanessa.
Vanessa?
I thought it was that Paula bitch.
it's a common mistake.
I liked Vanessa.
she has a good smile.
great smile.
she's alive. Vanessa's still alive.
Hey. Whoa. What are you doing?
how do you know she's in misery?
believe me, it is better this way.
wait. Don't you need that last bullet for yourself?
don't be telling me how to do this, Maconel.
it's only because you're lamer than I am,
I haven't blown you away at this point.
excuse me, but in as much as we may have the same feelings about these people,
I'm not half as lame as you are.
Oh, no?
then you tell me what you'd call a man who's stupid enough to piss off a maniac with a fucking loaded gun.
I'd call him a maniac...
with his own fucking loaded gun.
that was six.
Vanessa.
it's okay.
you're gonna make it.
let me see that smile.
come on.
come on, you can do it.
there you go.
it really does light up a room.
it's okay. [whimpering]
they're coming. They're coming. It's okay.
it's okay.
it's okay. [whimpers]
but it's not apparent if they were targeted specifically or if they were just at the wrong place at the wrong time.
since the gunman, Ralf Coleman, died at the scene, we may never know.
Jessica Light reports from the gunman's neighborhood in Crestview.
Jessica? Hi, I'm Jessica Light.
I'm here on a typical day in a typical suburban neighborhood hearing the same typical question after one of these tragic events.
how could this have happened here?
so tell me, what was Ralf Coleman like?
he always seemed like such a nice guy.
Yeah, he pretty much kept to himself.
he was such a quiet man.
[Woman on TV] Tragic as this event is, we're hearing that it could have been even worse if it weren't for the actions of one man, a man who was apparently unafraid to stand up to a violent world and just say, "No, I'm not taking it anymore.
[Fish] Timing not right again?
for your information,
I did pull the trigger today.
[Fish] No shit.
then what are you doing here...
alive?
it's a long story.
well, where the hell are we going?
talk to me. Some other time.
well, at least tell us
those fucking bastards are dead.
all right. [fish cheering]
so when are you leaving for Fiji?
well, not for-- We have two weeks next month.
Oh, wonderful. Yeah.
how'd your wife
Yeah, we're bringing a nanny, so, I mean...
Hello, Mr. Maconel. My name is Derrick Miles.
I wonder if I might ask you a few questions about what happened at IDT.
I'm with The Herald. How did you get my name?
you're an honest-to-God hero.
look, do you think we could continue this conversation inside?
[tires screeching] No.
[men chattering] Please, you'd make it so much easier on yourself if you just tell your story to one person.
it's called an exclusive.
you're not coming into my house.
please, Mr. Maconel, let me in before these vultures [Man] Mr. Maconel, please, sir!
go away!
go away!
[Man] We're here from Channel 5 News...
[Knocking on door] [Woman] Mr. Maconel!
welcome to our world, Bob.
chicken farmer
[Man #2 on TV] Ernesto. [grunts]
[Man on TV] Ernesto. Ernesto Williams.
okay, and can I call you chicken farmer?
Oh, fish.
there went our 15 minutes.
Bob?
you know how I was telling you my company was coming in?
is my lawn bothering you again?
no, no, no, no, no.
actually, I was wondering, since we're having a small
Christmas barbeque this weekend, that maybe you'd like to stop by.
it'd be nice to get to know our new neighbor.
I've lived here five years.
Oh, my, how time flies.
[Man] There he is. There's the man.
[Woman] Our champ.
[Man] Way to go, Bob.
well done, Maconel.
Hey, there he is! Hey, Bob.
no, Mr. Maconel.
you don't work here anymore.
come on.
have I been fired?
no. Come on.
where are we going?
all the way.
you know, I just think it's so great what you did.
now maniacs will think twice before going crazy.
he's waiting for you, Mr. Maconel.
it's right through those doors.
Oh, you can go right in, Mr. Maconel.
right through those doors.
there he is. Come on in, Bob.
I am so glad to finally meet you.
can-- Can I get you anything?
something to drink? A Pepsi or something?
Oh, Bob, this is Maurice Gregory.
I brought Maurice in to help the employees
Maurice is a good man and a gifted psychiatrist.
psychiatrist? Grief counselor.
here, have a seat.
have my seat. [chuckles]
sit down, sit down.
a lot of people asked about you at the eulogy.
Yeah, I'm sorry. I wanted to
Hey, hey, hey, hey. You don't have to explain yourself.
no, I'm sure this has been a little bit overwhelming to you.
it has.
but you've gotta understand,
it takes a very rare individual to keep his head and then take action in the face of certain death.
I'm a veteran.
I've had my scrapes, let me tell you.
but I knew who my enemy was.
I knew what I was getting into on the way in.
these days...
it can come from anywhere...
at any time...
from anyone.
that's true.
forgive my morbid curiosity, but did you actually see it happen?
I saw...
bodies hit the floor.
Jesus.
how did you manage to not get shot?
well, I was...
I was-- I dropped a paper clip, so I was already on the floor.
Oh, my God.
can you imagine that? A paper clip saved his life.
but then you saw your fellow workers dying right in front of your eyes.
it must have made you feel terrible.
that was a really stupid thing to say.
of course you felt terrible.
what am I thinking? What else are you gonna feel?
but then you pulled it together.
right?
and you, um...
and, uh...
and, well, here we are.
all right, enough of this depressing conversation.
I'm sure that you and Maurice will hash out that nightmare later.
right now I want you to come with me. Come on.
Bob, come on.
I pride myself on recognizing potential, and as tragic as this event has been, it's opened my eyes to a real talent that's been going to waste right beneath my nose.
I'm glad I met you. Me?
Yeah. I know, I know.
you feel wasted, unchallenged, like you've got good ideas but no one will listen, right?
come on, be honest with me.
it has been a long time since anybody asked me what I thought.
Yeah, well, those days are over,
welcome to your new think tank.
so, tell me, Bob.
what are you thinking now?
I'm thinking how I requested a window for years, and they said they didn't have any left.
Yeah, well, a few became available last week.
that's right.
this is the office of one of the victims.
my personal assistant. Vanessa Parks?
Vanessa died?
no, no.
but she won't be coming back.
[click tongue] Did you know her?
just her smile. [helicopter approaching]
Yeah, she could light up a room with that.
did you go to visit her at Saint Michael's?
no.
no?
Bob.
Why? Because you saved her life.
my God, man, the woman is probably desperate to thank you.
she doesn't even know my name.
I'm not suggesting it, Bob.
I'm telling you.
go visit her today.
during work hours?
you're gonna pay me to think?
it's a crazy world.
Oh, oh, oh, Bob.
when you, uh-- When you go see Vanessa,
I want you to take this with you and give it to her personally.
it's just some final work papers.
Oh, wait, Bob.
why don't you take your company car?
christ Almighty, it's Maconel.
you sly dog, playing possum all these years.
certainly had me fooled.
you know, I heard you were back, but I didn't see you in the pit.
I'm upstairs now.
and rightfully so.
all right, now the big question.
come on, Bob. How many?
two, three? Five.
five!
pay up, sucker.
Hey, last time I doubt this man's drive.
Oh, Bob.
you should join our foursome.
we could use somebody with your killer instinct on the back nine. Oh, man.
Cooper's guys would shit if we brought him out.
Yeah. [bell dings]
Hey, uh, happy hour this evening.
Barney's.
it's right across the street.
lose the briefcase, Bob. You're an executive now.
I'd like to visit Vanessa Parks.
that poor girl.
your name?
Bob Maconel.
Bob Maconel?
the Bob Maconel? Yeah.
honey, you gotta learn to speak up.
my husband thinks you should run for mayor.
Hey, Thelma! Thelma, answer my phones.
I gotta take Bob Maconel here to visit Vanessa.
we were so proud to see you. It's wonderful what
it's this way-- It's wonderful what you did.
in fact, we have your picture hanging in the cafeteria.
and of course, everybody wants you to sign it.
how is she?
you haven't heard?
only that she isn't coming back to work.
that bullet was right in her spine.
after the swelling went down and they removed it, the nerves never got back together again.
what are you saying? She's
[Whispers] Paralyzed.
how much? Like, her legs?
Vanessa?
there's a visitor here to see you.
no, no.
honey, it's Bob Maconel.
it's the hula man.
be right outside.
so, you're the man that saved me.
I guess so.
I've been wanting so much to meet you.
can you come here?
[Whispers] Closer.
closer.
[Whispers] Closer.
son of a bitch!
I was a goddess.
now look at me! I can't move!
I can't dance!
I certainly can't fuck now, can I?
you should have let Coleman finish the job!
you should have let me die!
fuck You! [sobbing]
I should have died.
you should have let him kill me.
fuck!
I hate you!
Hey, Maconel. [rapping on window]
just in time. We're going to Barney's.
come on. Put it in park and shake a leg.
it's happy hour. I don't want to be happy.
nonsense. Everybody wants to be happy.
I have to punch in my time card.
what, are you nuts? Executives don't have time cards.
come on. I don't drink.
great. It saves more for the rest of us! Right.
doesn't drink, my ass.
that was six.
Bob...
I gotta admit...
that day...
I about shit my pants when I saw Coleman raise that gun at me.
clich? as it sounds, my whole life flashed before my eyes, and I can't say I'm proud of much of it.
but you-- God.
you.
you're standing there cool as ice...
staring that guy down one-on-one.
it's amazing.
it's fucking amazing.
Yeah, but there's
there's one question that's been stuck in my brain.
if you had a gun, why did you wait till the shooting stopped to use it?
Hey, forget it.
you know, the important thing is...
that I didn't get my ass blown off that day, and I know I probably have you to thank for it.
uh, another round here.
Ugh, no six.
Oh, shit. There he is.
the Mind Fucker. [laughing]
I need to go home.
Oh, hey, Bob. You okay?
man, he's fucked up!
uh, somebody ought to drive him home.
Yeah, well, I'm in the other direction.
I'll take him home.
[Paula] Now, I hope you didn't take what I said last week too seriously.
I mean, a girl's got to protect herself from getting stuck with a loser.
you know, a guy with no future, no balls.
it's not you, Bob.
I mean, everyone knows that you've got a great future.
now, as for the balls...
you've certainly proven it.
Ugh. You've got a great big set of those.
I'd be more than honored if you'd like to take another look down my blouse.
actually...
Oh, fuck!
fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!
[Man] Hey, nice tits!
[honking] Fuck you, asshole! Fuck!
[Fish] Hello? Hey, Shithead.
get up.
wake up!
christ Almighty.
the master lives.
now, could you feed us before we all die?
you'd better hurry,
stripes is rolling for the third time.
you happen to see the lady that brought me here?
don't work that way, Bob. [grunting]
you don't see it, we don't see it. Remember?
[Clears throat] Nice tits, though.
Bob.
there he is.
my best drinkin' buddy.
so, uh, Bob, was it hot, huh?
was she everything she thinks she is?
I honestly can't say.
okay, a gentleman. [chuckling]
okay. We're going to have to work on that.
have you seen her? No.
not yet, but, uh,
I did see Mr. Shelby. He's looking for you, some important assignment you were supposed to take care of?
[Whispering] Yes.
I got to go.
Hey, Bob.
Bob?
I need to see Vanessa Parks.
Oh, that poor girl, are you a relative? No.
well, only relatives are allowed in during non-visiting hours.
I'm Bob Maconel.
Oh, I don't believe you're here
I know I upset her before
I've been trying to get a hold of you. What?
Vanessa. She wanted to see you again.
[Woman on intercom] Dr. Steven Chang to Cardio-Path Lab, Dr. Steven Chang...
can you close the door, please?
certainly was fast.
actually, I was coming to see you.
I was supposed to give this to you yesterday.
[Door closes] It's from Mr. Shelby.
I'm sure he would have delivered it himself, but uh, he's been real busy with everything that's happened.
I'm sure.
I could open it and read it to you.
no.
well, where would you like me to put it?
how about straight up his ass?
[sighing] I'm sorry, I
I didn't mean to snap at you.
it's okay. No, it's not.
I want to apologize for the way I treated you before.
it was completely unfair to blame you for my...
for my condition.
you risked your life to save me.
you had no idea I'd end up like this.
maybe you would've acted differently if you knew I'd never be able to use another body part again, or that I'd have to rely on people for the rest of my life to feed me and clothe me...
and diaper me.
you think you would have?
would have what?
acted differently.
Yes.
I knew it, I knew you were a compassionate man.
that's why you're the only one that I can ask this favor of.
I want you to finish what Coleman started.
Bob,
I don't want to live this way.
I can't live like this.
my spirit will die a million times every day.
if you have any feelings for me at all, you'll help me through it.
[Whispering] Please.
I can't do this anymore.
you're asking me to end your life?
it's already over.
I get released to home care Wednesday at five.
if I don't see you then, I-- I'll understand.
there you are. Mr. Shelby.
sit, sit, sit.
so, did you complete the assignment?
I delivered it to her personally.
excellent.
did she say anything when you told her it was from me?
no.
did she open it?
Vanessa's a quadriplegic.
she's completely paralyzed.
I know, I know. I'm sorry.
I'm, uh, just having so much trouble accepting this.
I had no idea that losing her would affect the company the way it has.
she did more than just brighten this place up.
she did the little things that nobody else will.
I feel a little bit lost without her.
well, if you...
need any help filling in the gaps, I can try.
you wouldn't mind?
it might help with my thinking.
all right, then.
I guess you could take this over, hah.
it's my wife's latest attempt to get published.
we need 50 copies of that by tomorrow to send out.
Oh, and um, when you finish with that, could you pick up these suits at Armine's?
they, um...
close at three.
Bob, Bob.
when are you coming to see me?
I have to get these copied.
uh, can I help you? I got it.
Hey, have you ever used this machine?
a copier's a copier.
ha, look,
I know you're the "big hero" around here, having shot the bad guy and all, but operating the 349 isn't as easy as pointing and pulling a trigger, you know what I'm saying, Bob?
these have to be perfect, they're for Mr. Shelby himself.
I'll be gentle.
I hear you've been looking for me.
quite a night, wasn't it, hm?
what happened? You don't remember?
[Chuckling] Well, I, uh,
I know now why you're such a quiet man.
Why?
because you don't have much to talk about...
down there.
[Giggling] Don't worry, baby.
[Whispering] It'll be our little secret.
it was supposed to be you.
Vanessa Parks is paralyzed because she looks like you.
what?
Coleman made a mistake.
you just dissed Paula Metzler.
you really are a bad-ass.
[Bob] She doesn't know how lucky she is.
[Woman on television] The F. B.I. is now saying sabotage was the cause of that airliner losing its wheel, which resulted in 12 deaths.
[Whispering] Finish what Coleman started.
the F. B.I. are also still piecing together the possible motive for Ralf Coleman's murderous rampage at ADD, but have so far made little progress.
they also refuse to link Coleman's actions to the recent discovery that his wife and daughter had died in an auto accident five years ago, [chanting] Finish what Coleman started.
saying it was too long ago to matter.
listen to them.
don't those fucking assholes know the world is a shitty place?
just ask Vanessa.
shut up!
that poor girl.
ready to leave?
how appropriate, my old company car.
yours?
what else did Shelby give you of mine?
your office.
I think your job.
well, whatever you do, don't sleep with him.
I won't.
okay, let me see how to do this.
all right? Yup.
that's it.
this one around my chest, here, there's this clip in the back.
all right.
you going to be all right, if I do this?
don't worry, I won't feel anything if you touch me.
uh, well, maybe
maybe not everything.
I will not blink again
okay, there you go.
you will be sure as I am That you and I are one
now what?
just get me out of here.
[Vanessa] I've been giving this a lot of thought, and I think I've figured out a way for you to do this without getting any blood on your hands.
the last thing I want is for you to get into any trouble over this.
legally or spiritually.
and I'm not taking any bullshit pills either.
I'm going out the same way I came in...
dramatically.
there's a station on the Red Line, one where the South Express doesn't stop.
the concrete in the waiting area is sloped, not very much, but it's smooth all the way down.
so, just position me at the top, and when we feel the train coming, just let me go, and gravity will take over.
what station?
Franklin Street.
the one by the Crown Superstore?
Yeah.
is it a busy station?
thank you.
watch out.
bye Bye.
up there.
I'm sorry, the lift is out of order.
Byebye.
don't move!
hurry, over there!
disappear! Over there!
isn't it ready yet?
I'm just fixing the whatnot...
it's all set now.
if I didn't promise your late father.
you wouldn't be here at all.
I'm sorry.
what's next?
the plane.
what? The yacht.
what?
Oh no, the glider.
get on with it then.
the glider...
hurry up!
bye Bye.
nice to see you again
welcome back.
have you had a nice trip in Hong Kong.
no, I haven't.
godfather is unhappy.
me too.
he is waiting for you. You'd better be careful.
thank you.
godfather Atonio
go and play with your mom.
my child.
I'm sorry. My dear godfather.
what have you done?
what are you doing?
but this one...
whenever you have done something wrong, you have an explanation.
now you tell me who did it.
white Glove.
it's him? Where's he now?
he is in Venice.
I've always trusted you, child.
I am loyal to you too.
no matter what, you go to Hong Kong and get the diamonds back.
why me?
otherwise, you would die.
you can make use of my relationship with Hong Kong.
I can lose the diamonds.
but I can't lose the Italians' faces.
but I am British.
don't you understand,
british and Italians are family.
why I have never heard of that?
diamonds or your life.
morning, Sir.
sir, According to our information,
you forget, my Chinese is better than your English.
Hua, you carry on.
a robbery took place in Tsimshatsui Centre recently.
an invaluable consignment of diamonds was lost but was not reported.
here's the information we have.
this is Szeto, who deals in stolen goods.
this is the leader of an international smuggling syndicate.
an Italian by the name of Monterosso.
szeto didn't lose anything in the robbery, and the Italian didn't report any loss to the police either.
there's only a white glove left at the scene of the crime.
that's all the information we have.
all the information is supplied by the informer Squealie.
for obvious reasons, his true identity is kept top secret.
we all know him, it's Ming.
hush walls have ears.
this is the internationally renowned burglar.
white Glove, who specialized in diamonds and gold.
he has 7 passports, 8 different names, nine identities and two sexes.
it is indeed our honour, that he has graced us worth his presence, but unfortunately, also our dishonour.
so we must get the help of his arch enemies.
arch enemies?
Yes, he has two.
one is Peter Sellers, the Pink Panther.
but he is no longer with us.
the other is...
he is... Hey, you're in the way.
the U. S. super sleuth, Kodojak,
because of White Glove, he was downgraded from inspector to sergeant, and lost all his hair.
if he doesn't catch
white Glove in 3 months' time, he'll be dismissed from the force.
we'll bring Kodojak here, since he is most keen on getting White Glove.
we'll also be assigning superintendent Ho.
that tough lady, to assist Kodojak in the case.
marvelous idea!
hey you, got a light?
wow, it's a bird!
wonderful!
come on baby light my fire.
she's a little overdressed for that.
wait till you find out what's under it all.
you wanna look?
sure thing!
don't blink! Here, I got a light.
don't make me angry.
it's all his fault, sorry, lady.
let's go. It's all your fault.
let's get out of here.
never seen legs before?
no, I was just admiring your holster.
are you going to meet Kadojak?
I'm too busy for that. I'm here to look for Squealie, the informer.
you'll never find him in this crowd.
no Worry!
he'll hear me when I shout.
Squealie!
he's not here.
hold it right there. Gotta go!
gotta go.
hold it!
go to hell. Hold it.
come on down here.
there's nobody! Don't take it so seriously.
I'm covering for you. Got anything for me?
sure, 3 clues, 2 are good and one's bad.
give me the two good ones.
kodojak is arriving from the State today.
you've been assigned to work with him.
how come you know our stuff too?
I'm a professional informer.
what else?
there's a robbery at the Kowloon City jewellery shop.
how did you know it's today?
I picked the day for them, most propitious.
for robberies?
no, for catching the robbers.
let's have the bad one too.
your senior said you wouldn't be at the airport today, and told me to do my rounds here.
I never thought I'd run into you.
the plane has landed.
I have to go check out a case.
what case?
a big case, mind your own business.

just today.
how did you get through the border? Did you swim?
I flew.

none. No friends either.
there's only 1 person in Hong Kong who knows me.

the Governor.
he invited me here.
very smart!
you have the right to remain silent, anything you say, may be used against you in court. Right?

you...
don't you dare!
you hit me before I even touched you?
don't move!
good, very good.
great to see you in action, Kodojak.
nothing to it. She's even better.
naturally, Superintendent Ho has a reputation of efficiency, but she's a little slow with her gun, eh?
I've arranged for her to assist you on this case.
her! No thanks!
as cover, you two will pose as a married couple.
what? Him as my husband?
with his looks. I'd rather have a gorilla.
looking for trouble, bitch!
are the hotel rooms booked yet?
sure thing.
get a room next to mine for her with an adjoining door.
wishful thinking!
you're not scared of him, are you?
of course not!
I just don't like hotels, we'll stay at my place.
your place?
are you chicken?
why should I be?
don't think of me as a woman.
they all treat me like a man downtown.
don't you ever forget, we are only pretending to be married.
Oh, come on, I've seen it all before.
come out!
according to Squealie.
the diamond job was done by him, King Kong.
also known as Superman.
he has a partner Gigolo Joe, who's always surrounded by women.
he's tattooed with all their phone numbers.
after the job, they both disappeared.
king Kong lives on the 5th floor.
king Kong, Joe here.
use the code.
Oh sorry, Minnie Mouse calling Mickey, over.
Mickey hear, go ahead.
I've hid the diamonds...
the code! The code!
Oh sorry, I've hid the peanuts...
don't tell me. I talk in my sleep.
I know that. But I have to tell you.
Why?
because I just made it with Mad Max's sister.
you must be going mad. Max will come after you.
I know. That's why I have to tell you.
O. K. Where?
Oh no, I can't tell you where.
how will I know where to go then?
that's true. I'll whisper.
it's Seventh Heaven.
I can't hear you. Louder.
stupid!
seventh Heaven. Got that?
better get to Seventh Heaven quickly.
and give the diamonds to Mickey.
don't forget they're not diamonds. They're peanuts
it's him!
the White Glove. Chase him.
king Kong.
Oh no, it's her!
stay right there!
not that one, the other one!
be careful!
you want me dead?
better take some driving lessons first.
you bastard.

don't you dare go... I'll catch you.
hold it right there, King Kong.
stop, Police.
bitch.
bye Bye.
stop.
a table for how many?
I'll help myself, thank you.
I'm here.
the diamonds, no, I mean, the peanuts...
are very well hidden.
I've tattooed the clue on 2 different women.
go on, don't be so nervous.
why shouldn't I?
you know how in the movies, the informer usually gets killed, before he can finish talking.
don't worry, the one listening always lives.
get it out.
the diamonds,
yes?
can't you see I've been shot?
it's only the champagne. Get on with it.
let's go to the washroom.
alright, you can talk now.
hurry.
I put the diamonds... I mean, the peanuts, in Kowloon.
wait, hush.
why not?
it's ok! Say it.
I'm deaf, I can't hear anything.
he is dumb. He can't say anything.
what?

Yes, sir.

the same way the diamonds were stolen.
your turn, Danny!
don't be afraid, I'm right here.
I can't get it out.
the other way around.
Oh no, look behind you.
you'd be dead without my help.
thanks for your help.
how are you gonna pay me back.
wait till my lawyer arrives.
get me up first.
I'm investigating the diamond case recently.
I didn't do it.
I must have get the wrong person.
I admit it, I did it...
where are the diamonds?
I have no idea.
don't scare me, I have a weak heart.
I'm telling you the truth.
where are the diamonds?
my partner had them.
where is he now?
he's dead.
don't push me too far...
alright... I'll help you recover the diamonds.
you also have to find White Glove for me.
but you have to promise me one thing.
what?
don't press charges against me.
it's a deal.
how can I be sure?
I swear.
is the bomb ready?
it's ready.
take it up.
the bugging device?
it's being installed.
who did you send?
blabbermouth.
you can even hear his breathing a mile off.
not this time.
I can hardly stay here for another minute.
it's so dead.
have your dinner first.
the steak is awful.
it tastes like cotton wool.
you punk.
and Baldy is so lacking in manners!
and you ask me to live with him.
it's so stuffy here.
I feel suffocated.
see, not a sound to the end.
what about the bomb?
on it's way up.
even the door bell sounds bad.
what is it?
delivery.
must be my sister's. Just leave it.
put it down. Fine.
I can't stand it, going home.
I'll be at my place if you want me.
I live here.
me too.
you're home, sis...
don't look at him, come on in.
who is he?
him, you don't have to know him.
this one, no, don't bother.
sit down.
didn't you say you're leaving?
Yes, go on, scram.
why don't you stay a while?
japan was a lot of fun.
have you been there before?
sure.
on business?
Yes, on a job.
Yes, on a job
hush. I think he's really stuck on your sister.
I'll bet he doesn't even know his own name now.
what's your name?
I have no idea.
did you steal the diamonds?
I did.
where did you put them?
my partner hid them.
how can we recover them?
he put the clue on two different women.
how can I find them?
I needn't bother now that I've found you.
you heard it, Baldy.
I think he stole the diamonds.
are you lying?
no, I am not.
I'd lie to Baldy and that bitch but,
I'd never lie to you.
why are you holding my hand?
so what, we're both men.
you heard, he knows where the diamonds are.
I am assigning you to be responsible for his safety, before we find the diamonds.
Oh no, the bomb.
who delivered it?
I did.
go bring it back, quick.
there isn't enough time.
Why?
there's only time for the trip up.
he has to be kept alive. Go get the bomb.
aren't you gonna leave?
me, leave?!
it's much nicer here.
the steak is good but your sister is a little too much...
what did you say?
just a tiny weeny little bit.
even the door bell sounds good.
I'm really enjoying the stay.
wrong address.
dumb jerk.
heavy shoes?! On your way now please.
here it comes!
run for cover.
all the tattoos on Joe, are done by this guy.
let's hope he remembers.
please think carefully.
what did have he tattooed?
it's always a woman's name or telephone no.
he's got it all over his body.
did he bring any woman for a tattoo?
Yes, two of them.
and he wanted them done here.
what did he want tattooed?
how can I remember? They come, they go...
this clue's dead.
chance for locating the diamonds becomes small.
and chance for going into the jail becomes big.
you are too hasty.
we still have another clue.
and that is...?
he shouted Rose before he died.
I think that's the name of his girl friend.
hello there.
did you just come out from the tattoo place?
Yes.
then you must have a picture taken.
Why?
everybody does it after his tatto's done.
do you think...
it's right here, step this way.
rose?!
actually, we didn't come for the photo session.
then what do you want?
get out.
I came to pick up some photos for my friend.
and who may that be?
did anybody have a nude picture taken?
Burt did!
so you're friends of Burt Reynolds.
no, we're friends of Joe.
I don't know what you're talking about?
the guy with all the girl's telephones tattooed all over, and always talking nonsense.
I know, you mean Gigolo Joe.
that's right.
he only left a deposit and never come back.
the photos are vital to us.
I forgot where I put them.
I'm quite busy, you know...
please look for them...
let me do it.
keep watch for me, whistle if someone turns up.
you're in for it now...
what do you want? Money?
I'm married.

I am quite old.
I am not choosy.
I'm not so pretty.

she wouldn't recognize me then.
you better put one on too.
Oh no!
I'll give you the photos.
smart!
give it to me!
it's all here.
I found out.
one of the girls work at this taxicab place.
leave the talking to me.
Why?
you can only handle the older dames.
with younger ones, it's me or nothing.
I'm not so sure.
I was in a Body Building Contest once.
And?
I won, of course!
how many entrants were there?
just me, of course!
anyway, just keep your mouth shut.
listen, it's my case.
I get to talk to the girls.
Hey, it hurts.

you'll see that it says.
map.
a map. Right.
Joe also kept saying Kowloon.
so now, let's look at a Kowloon map.

I think the first one was defective.
the plus sign looks more like a division symbol, so I remain unconvinced.
third test today, mama bear.
your eggo is prego, no doubt about it.
it's really easy to tell.
is your nipples real brown?
Yeah, maybe your little boyfriend's got mutant sperms; knocked you up twice.
Silencio, old man!
look, I just drank my weight in SunnyD and I got to go pronto.
well, you know where the lavatory is.
and pay for that pee stick when you're done.
don't think it's yours just 'cause you marked it with your urine.
what's the prognosis, fertile Myrtle?
minus or plus?
I don't know. It's not seasoned yet.
take some of these.
no, there it is.
God, that little pink plus sign is so unholy.
that ain't no Etch A Sketch.
this is one doodle that can't be undid, home skillet.
~ I took the Polaroid down in my room ~
~ I'm pretty sure you have a new girlfriend ~
~ It's not as if I don't like you ~
~ It just makes me sad whenever I see it ~
~ 'Cause I like to be gone most of the time ~
~ And you like to be home most of the time ~
~ If I stay in one place, I lose my mind ~
~ I'm a pretty impossible lady to be with ~
~Joey never met a bike that he didn't want to ride ~
~ And I never met a Toby that I didn't like ~
~ Scotty liked all of the books that I recommended ~
~ Even if he didn't, I wouldn't be offended ~
~ I had a dream that I had to drive to Madison ~
~ To deliver a painting ~
~ For some silly reason ~
~ I took a wrong turn and ended up in Michigan... ~
yo, yo, yogiddy, yo.
I'm a suicide risk.
Juno?
no, it's Morgan Freeman.
do you have any bones that need collecting?
only the one in my pants.
I'm pregnant.
What?! Honest to blog?
Yeah. Yeah, it's Bleeker's.
it's probably just a food baby.
did you have a big lunch?
no, this is not a food baby, all right?
I've taken, like, three pregnancy tests, and I am for shiz up the spout.
how did you even generate enough pee for three pregnancy tests?
that's amazing.
I don't know. I drank, like, ten tons of SunnyD.
anyway, dude, I'm telling you I'm pregnant, and you're acting shockingly cavalier.
is this for real? Like, for real for real?
unfortunately, yes.
Oh, my God!
Oh, shit!
phuket, Thailand.
there we go.
that was kind of the emotion that I was searching for on the first take.
so, are you going to go to Havenbrook or Women Now?
cause you know you need a note from your parents for Havenbrook.
Yeah, I know, um...
no, I'm going to go to Women Now just 'cause they help out women now.
Hey, do you want me to call for you?
cause I called for Becky last year.
no, I can call myself.
Oh, but I do need your help with something.
it's, like, critically important.
you know, heavy lifting can really only help you at this point.
seriously.
so you were bored?
that's how this blessed miracle came to be?
no. No, no. The act was premeditated.
I mean, the sex, not the whole, like, let'sgetpregnant thing.
so, when did you decide that you were going to, uh, do Bleeker?
well, like... a year ago in Spanish class.
~ Besame mucho. ~
you love him.
it's... no, it's actually, it's really complicated, okay?
and I don't feel like talking about it in my fragile state.
so what was it like humping Bleek's bony bod?
magnificent.
~ 'Cause he gets up in the morning ~
~ And he goes to work at 9: 00 ~
~ And he comes back home at 5: 30 ~
~ Gets the same train every time ~
~ 'Cause his world is built on punctuality ~
~ It never fails ~
~ And he's, oh, so good ~
~ And he's, oh, so fine ~
~ And he's, oh, so healthy in his body and his mind ~
~ He's a wellrespected man about town ~
~ Doing the best things so conservatively. ~
Hey, Bleek.
wicked tiger.
he looks proud.
I swiped it from Miss Ransick's lawn.
wow, your shorts are, like, especially gold today.
my mom uses colorsafe bleach.
go, Carol.
I'll tell her.
when I see them all running like that with their things bouncing around in their shorts, I always picture them naked even if I don't want to.
all I see is pork swords.
I'm supposed to be running.
so guess what?
what? I don't know.
I'm pregnant.
what should we do... about...?
well, you know, I was just... I was thinking I'd just nip it in the bud before it gets worse.
cause they were talking about, in health class, how pregnancy, it can often lead to an infant.
typically, yeah, yeah.
that's what happens when our moms and teachers get pregnant.
so you're cool with that then?
Yeah, yeah, Wizard, I mean, you know, just, I guess do whatever you think you should do, you know?
well, I'm sorry I had sex with you.
I know it wasn't, like, your idea.
whose idea was it?
I'll see you at school, all right?
whose idea was it?
your book feel apart.
right.
must have looked at your face.
the funny thing is that Steve Rendazo secretly wants me.
jocks like him always want freaky girls girls with hornrimmed glasses, and vegan footwear, and Goth makeup...
girls who, like, play the cello and read McSweeney's and want to be childrens' librarians when they grow up.
Oh, yeah, jocks totally eat that shit up.
they just won't admit it because they're supposed to be into, like, the perfect cheerleaders, you know?
like Leah, who, incidentally, is into teachers.
me, too!
I love Woody Allen.
all right, all right.
all right, people, we're doing chromatography lab today.
so find your partners and break into groups of four.
well, there's nothing like experimenting.
um, I did the prep questions for this lab last night.
so you can just copy my answers if you...
Oh, I couldn't copy your work.
you copy my work every week.
true. I'm kind of a deadbeat lab partner, aren't I?
no, I don't mind.
I think you definitely bring something to the table.
charisma.
so who's ready for some chromomagnificence?
Yeah, I have a menstrual migraine, so I can't really look at bright lights today.
Amanda, I told you to go to the infirmary and lie down.
you never listen.
no, Josh, because I don't take orders, not from you and not from any man.
you've been acting like this ever since I got back from visiting my brother in Mankato.
I already told you, nothing happened.
well, I'm gonna set up the apparatus.
um, Juno, do you want to plug in the Bunsen burner?
it's my pleasure. I'm going to the infirmary.
good. Call me when you get off the rag.
fine. Call me when you learn how to love someone instead of cheat at your brother's college just because you had four Smirnoff Ices and a bottle of snow peak peach flavored Boone's.
good, Amanda, I'll be sure to do that.
I'll make a note of it.
I've actually heard that the snow peak peach flavor is the best flavor of Boone's.
isn't that right, Bleek?
Oprima el numero dos.
Hey, yeah, um,
II'm just calling to procure a hasty abortion.
what?
can you just hold on for a second?
I'm on my hamburger phone.
y... okay, yeah, now I can...
Yeah, it's just, like, really awkward to talk on.
um...
Yeah, yeah, I...
I need an abortion.
sixteen.
I'm gonna say it's been about, um... two months and four days since the sex.
mind you, that's just, like, a guesstimation.
sorry, how long have I been what?
Ugh, I hate it when adults use the term " sexually active. "
what does it even mean?
that I, like, deactivate someday?
or is this some sort of permanent state ofbeing?
I guess Bleeker went live that night we did it, I guess, and that's why he got that look on his face.
should've seen this octopus furnace at work.
I had to get on my Hazmat suit just to get into the thing.
my dad used to be in the army, but now he's just your average HVAC specialist.
he and my mom got divorced when I was, like, five and she lives on a Havasu reservation in Arizona with her new husband and three replacement kids.
Oh, and she inexplicably mails me a cactus every Valentine's Day.
and I'm like, " Thanks a heap, coyote ugly.
this cactusgram stings even worse than your abandonment. "
that's my stepmom, Bren.
she's completely obsessed with dogs, owns a nail salon and always smells like methyl methacrylate.
so, Juno, how was your little maneuver last night?
which maneuver, sir?
the one where I move an entire living room set from one lawn to the other or the one where I downed a 64-ounce blue Slushee in ten minutes.
Juno, did you by any chance barf in my urn?
mac, you know that nice urn by the front door, the one I got up in Stillwater?
Mmhmm.
there was some blue shit...
I mean, gunk, stuff in there this morning.
I would never barf in your urn, Brenda.
I mean, maybe LB did it.
liberty Bell, if you put one more BacO on that potato, I'm gonna kick your little monkey butt.
all babies want to get borned.
all babies want to get borned.
all babies want to get borned.
all...
Hey, SuChin.
Oh. Hi, Juno.
how are you?
you know, pretty solid.
um...
so, did you... did you write that paper for Worth's class yet?
no, not yet.
I tried to work on it a little last night, but I'm having trouble concentrating.
Oh, well, I'll sell you some of my Adderall, if you...
no, thanks.
I'm off pills.
it's a wise choice.
cause I knew this girl, she had this, like, crazy freakout 'cause she took too many behavioral meds at once.
and she just, like, ripped off her clothes and dove into the fountain at Ridgedale mall, and was like, " Bligh, I'm a kraken from the sea! "
I heard that was you.
well, it's good seeing you, SuChin.
your baby probably has a beating heart, you know.
it can feel pain.
and it has fingernails!
fingernails? Really?
welcome to Women Now, where women are trusted friends.
please put your hands where I can see them and surrender any bombs.
Hey, I'm here for the big show.
your name, please?
Juno MacGuff.
she thinks I'm using a fake name, like Gene Simmons or Mother Teresa.
I need you to fill these out, both sides, and don't skip the hairy details.
we need to know about every score and every sore.
would you like a free condom?
they're boysenberry.
no, I'm... I'm off sex right now.
my boyfriend uses them every time we have intercourse.
they make his junk smell like pie.
all babies want to get borned.
all babies want to...
God appreciates your miracle!
dude, what are you doing here?
I'm supposed to come get you at 4: 00.
couldn't do it, Leah.
it smelled like a dentist's office in there.
and there were these horrible magazines with water stains.
and then the friggin' receptionist is trying to get me to take these condoms that look like grape suckers.
and just babbling away about her friggin' boyfriend's pie balls.
Ooh, yum.
Oh, and then SuChin was there. Yeah.
and she was like, " Oh, hi. Babies have fingernails. "
fingernails.
that's gruesome. Do you think the baby could all like scratch your vag on the way out and then it would...?
I'm staying pregnant, Leah.
dude! You got to keep your voice down, okay?
my mom is inside.
she doesn't know that we're sexually active.
what does that even mean?
I've been thinking.
I was thinking I could, like, have this baby and give it to someone that, like, totally needs it.
you know, like, a woman with a bum ovary or a couple nice lesbos.
but then you're gonna get, like, huge.
and your chest is gonna milktate.
and you're gonna have to, like... tell people that you're pregnant.
Yeah, but maybe they'll, like, canonize me for being so selfless.
or maybe they'll, like, totally shit and be really, really mad and not let you graduate or go to Cabo for spring break.
I was gonna go to Gettysburg with Bleeker anyway.
you should look at adoption ads.
I see them all the time in the PennySaver.
they have ads for parents?
Yeah.
"Desperately seeking spawn "
right next to, like, terriers and iguanas and used fitness equipment and stuff.
it's... it's, like, totally legit.
Mm. " Wholesome, spiritually wealthy couple have found true love with each other. " Aw.
all that's missing is your bastard.
I want a parakeet.
Juno, you're totally not even listening to me.
no, I heard you.
I just, like, I don't want to give the baby to a family that describes themselves as " wholesome. "
Why? Well, I don't know,
I just want someone a little more edgier.
okay, what did you have in mind exactly?
I was thinking more like... graphic designer, mid30s, you know, with a cool Asian girlfriend who, like, dresses awesome and rocks out on the bass guitar.
but I don't want to be too particular.
okay.
uh, how about this?
educated, successful couple seeking "infant to join our family of five.
you will be compensated.
help us complete the circle of love. "
that sounds great.
they sound like a freakin' cult is what they sound like.
and, besides, they already have three kids.
you know, they're just like greedy little bitches.
Ooh, Juno.
how about this one?
they were Mark and Vanessa Loring, and they were beautiful even in black and white.
Hey, Paul, are you coming downstairs to eat?
uh, no, I don't think so.
you ran eight miles today, puppy.
I'm not hungry, oddly.
but it's breakfast for supper.
it's your favorite, Paul.
Yeah.
Juno MacGuff called while you were out running today.
you know how I feel about her.
Yeah, yeah, you mentioned it a couple times.
she's just... different.
I know.
so I'm not really sure how I'm gonna spit this out.
hon, did you get expelled?
no, the school would most likely contact you in the event of my expulsion.
well, I was just asking.
it seemed plausible.
what, do you need a large amount of money?
legal counsel?
I'm not... I'm not asking for anything.
except for maybe mercy.
like, it would be friggin' sweet if no one hit me.
well, what have you done, June bug?
did you hit someone with the Previa?
no.
dude, I think it's best to just tell them.
I'm pregnant.
Oh, God.
Yeah, but I'm gonna give it up for adoption.
and I already found the perfect couple.
they're gonna pay for the medical expenses and everything.
and... what, 30, er, odd weeks, we can just pretend that this never happened.
you're pregnant?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
and if it is any consolation,
I have heartburn that is radiating my kneecaps, and I haven't taken a dump since... Wednesday.
morning.
I didn't even know you were sexually active.
who is the kid?
the baby? I don't really know much about it other than... I mean, it has fingernails, allegedly. Nails? Really.
Yeah.
no, I don't, I mean, who is the father, Juno?
um...
it's... it's Paulie Bleeker.
Paulie Bleeker?
what?
I didn't think he had it in him.
I know, right?
right. This is no laughing matter.
no, it's not.
and you know, Paulie is actually great in, uh... Okay.
in chair.
you're thinking about adoption?
Yeah, yeah, and it, there's this couple they haven't had, you know, they've been trying to have a kid for, like, five years.
we found them in the PennySaver next to the exotic birds.
and they have a legitimate lawyer and I was gonna go meet with them next weekend.
june bug, that is a tough, tough thing to do.
it's probably tougher than you can understand right now.
Oh, I... I know.
and I... it's just that I'm not ready to be a mom.
damn skippy, you're not.
you don't even remember to give Liberty Bell her breathing meds.
that was once, and she did not die, if you recall.
honey, had you considered you know... the alternative?
no.
you're a little Viking.
first things first.
all right, we have to get you healthy.
you need prenatal vitamins.
incidentally, they do incredible things for your nails, so that's a plus.
Oh, and we need to schedule a doctor's appointment.
figure out where you're going to deliver.
Juno, I'm coming with you to meet this... adoption couple.
you're just a kid.
I don't want you to get ripped off by a couple of babystarved wing nuts.
Thanks, Dad.
boy, I thought you were the kind of girl who knew when to say when.
I don't really know what kind of girl I am.
just tell it to me straight, Bren.
you think this is my fault?
I think kids get bored and they have intercourse.
and I think June bug was a dummy about it, Mac.
I am not ready to be a Pop Pop.
you're not gonna be a Pop Pop.
somebody else is gonna find a precious blessing from Jesus in this garbage dump of a situation.
did you see that coming when she sat us down here?
Yeah, but I was hoping she was expelled or into hard drugs.
that was my first instinct, too, or a DWI.
anything but this.
and I'm gonna punch that Bleeker kid in the wiener next time I see him.
Mac. Come on.
you know it wasn't his idea.
Yeah.
Hi.
I'm Vanessa. You must beJuno.
Mr. MacGuff, hi.
Vanessa Loring.
it's, uh, Vanessa, right? Is that...
thanks for having me and my irresponsible child over to your house.
Oh, no, thank you. Thank you.
come on in.
can I take your coat or your hat?
Oh, yeah, sure. Thanks.
Oh, wicked pic in the PennySaver, by the way.
super classy, not like those people with the fake woods in the background.
honestly, who do they think they're fooling?
you found us in the PennySaver?
Hi. Mark Loring. I'm the husband.
how you doing?
mac MacGuff. Nice to meet you. Hi.
this is Gerta Rauss, our, um, attorney.
Gerta Rauss.
Hi. Nice to meet you.
and this, of course, is Juno.
like the city in Alaska.
no.
no?
hon? Shall we sit down, get to know one another?
well, I thought I'd get some drinks.
what would anyone like?
I have Pellegrino or vitamin water or... orange juice with...
I'll have a Maker's Mark, please. Up.
she's kidding.
june bug has a wonderful sense of humor, just one of her many genetic gifts.
I'll sit down.
so, Juno, first off, how far along are you?
I'm a junior.
no, I mean, in your pregnancy.
Oh, right.
um, well, actually my stepmom took me yesterday to the doctor, and they said I was 1 2 weeks.
that's great. That's marvelous.
so you're into your second trimester.
uh... yeah.
apparently. I'm due on May fourth.
great.
my girlfriends tell me that the first couple of months are the hardest.
I didn't notice it at all, actually.
uh, I'm more concerned about when they have to put that, like, elastic band, you know, in the front of my jeans.
I think pregnancy's beautiful.
Oh, you're lucky it's not you.
let's talk about how we're gonna do this thing.
what do you mean, don't I just have the thing, squeeze it on out and hand it over?
mark and Vanessa are willing to negotiate an open adoption.
uh, wait, what does that mean?
it means they'd send annual updates, photos, let Juno know how the baby is doing. as he, or she, grows up.
whoa, whoa. No, no, no, no, no.
I don't want photos or any kind of notification.
you know. I mean...
can't we just, like, kick this old school?
you know, like, I stick the baby in a basket send it your way, like Moses in the reeds?
technically, that would be kicking it Old Testament.
exactly. Right?
do you know what I mean?
like in the good old days, when it was quick and dirty.
well, then... we all agree?
a traditional closed adoption would be best for all involved.
shit. Yes.
just close 'er on up.
obviously we would compensate you for all your medical expenses.
are you looking for any other type of compensation?
excuse me?
what? No.
no, I don't want to, you know, sell the thing.
I just... I want...
I just want the baby to be with people who are gonna love it and be good parents, you know?
um...
I mean, I'm in high school.
dude, I'm just... I'm ill equipped.
well, you're doing a beautiful and a selfless thing for us.
Vanessa's wanted a baby ever since we got married.
I want to be a mommy so badly.
you don't say.
have you ever felt like you were just born to do something?
Yes.
heating and airconditioning.
there you go.
I was born to be a mother.
some of us are.
how about you, Mark? Are you, uh... looking forward to being a dad?
Mmm. Betcha.
Yeah.
every guy wants to be a father, wants to coach the soccer team and help out with the science fair... the volcano goes off... I don't know.
Yeah. All that.
maybe Gerta could take us through the preliminary documents that you've drawn up.
sweet. Yeah, uh, could I use the facilities first?
cause being pregnant makes me pee like Seabiscuit.
sure. The downstairs bathroom's being retiled, but if you go upstairs and then to the right and to the...
Oh, yeah. The room with the toilet.
is she all right?
Oh! It's you. Sorry.
sorry. I didn't expect to see you up here.
just came up to get something.
did your wife send you up here to spy on me?
no What? Do we come off as paranoid yuppies or something?
well, I... I stole a squirt of your wife's perfume.
Really? It's Clinique Happy.
get a whiff of those sparklin' top notes.
Oh, yeah. That supposed to make me feel... happy?
you should feel happy, homes.
I'm giving you and Vanessa the gift of life sweet, screaming, pooping life and you don't even have to be there when it comes out all covered in, um... Viscera. blood and guts.
is that a Les Paul?
Yes, it is.
Vanessa gave me my own room for all my stuff.
she gave you your own room in... in... in...in your whole house for your... for your stuff?
Wow. She's got you on a long leash there, Mark.
Oh, it's beautiful!
you know, I always loved Gibson more than Fender. Like, just...
what do you play?
um... I rock a Harmony.
Oh.
is it mahogany? Yeah.
and what happens if you crack the neck?
I mean, that must be, like, a bitch to...
tell me about it. I used to play in this real tight band when I lived in Chicago, and this one night we opened up for the Melvins, and I busted that thing right onstage. It cost me $800
just to get it fixed.
whoa. So... so when was that? Was that, like...?
93. Best time for rock 'n' roll.
Nuhuh!
77! Are you...?
What?! Punk, volume number one!
you're crazy.
you weren't there.
you couldn't understand the magic.
you weren't even alive!
what's that?
it's a Pilates machine.
what do you make with it?
you don't make anything.
it's for exercising.
Yeah, my wife ordered one of those, uh...
Tony Little " Gazelles " off the TV.
you know, from the guy with the ponytail?
guy just doesn't look right to me.
I'll be right back.
excuse me.
~ ...really want to ~
~ Really, really want to, and I do, too ~
~ I want to be... ~ Hi.
Hi.
you're playing music.
Juno wanted a little closer look at Kimber.
your guitar is named Kimber?
Yeah. That's cool. My ax is named Roosevelt, but after Franklin, not Ted.
Franklin he was the hot one with the polio?
Yeah. Um... hey, Gerta's downstairs.
we still have... we still have a lot of stuff to go over and do.
I got it. I got it.
you got it? Got it.
not to interrupt the jam session, but...
just look these over.
if you have any questions, call me at my office.
we would really appreciate if you would just, you know, keep us updated on any doctor's appointments or ultrasounds or anything of that nature, if it's not too much...
no. Right. For sure.
you want to know how your kid's acookin'. I get it.
you think you're really going to do this, then?
Yeah. Yeah. No. I... I like you guys. Yeah.
how sure would you say you are?
like... Would you say you're 80% sure, or 90% sure or...?
I'm going to say I'm about 1 04% sure.
Really?
here you go, sir.
no, seriously, if I could just have the thing, and give it to you now, I totally would.
but I'm guessing it looks, probably, like a sea monkey right now, and, you know, we should let it get a...
get a little... get a little cuter.
right? Yes. That's great.
keep it in the oven.
I think that's a great idea.
nice to meet you both.
you, too. Please drive carefully.
hopefully, we'll hear from you soon. Thank you.
thank you. All right. You take care.
all right. Byebye.
hmm?
honey...
come here.
~ I'm sticking with you ~
~ 'Cause I'm made out of glue ~
~ Anything that you might do ~
~ I'm gonna do, too... ~
Hey, man.
Hey, Vijay. How's it going?
did you hear? Juno MacGuff's pregnant.
Yeah.
like our moms and teachers. Yeah.
did you hear it's yours?
Yep.
what a trip, huh?
I don't really know too much about it.
you should grow a mustache.
I can't.
me neither.
but I'm going to stop wearing underpants.
raise my sperm count.
see ya.
~ 'Cause I'm made out of glue ~
~ Anything that you might do ~
~ I'm gonna do, too. ~
Juno, hey. Hey, Bleek.
me and some guys are going to go to the movies after school, and we're going to doughnut that flick with the guy who has 1 8 kids.
you want to come?
Oh, it... sounds awesome, but I got my ultrasound.
Oh, really?
can I, uh...
should I come, you think?
Aw, you... you can't waste those... those doughnut holes there.
I... But maybe I could, you know, drop by later.
okay. Cool.
later, Bleek.
see ya.
I'll save you a seat.
there's your baby.
Ah! Oh!
Oh, my God!
there's a hand.
Oh! Oh!
and an arm.
and there's the feet.
Oh!
would you look at that?
Whoa! Check out Baby Big Head!
dude, that thing is freaky looking.
excuse me I am a sacred vessel, all right? All you've got in your stomach is Taco Bell.
it's amazing that there's actually saps that cry at this.
what? I'm not made of stone.
well, there you have it.
would you like to know the sex?
Yes. No.
please, Juno. Please!
no. Definitely no. There's no sex.
planning to be surprised when you deliver.
well, no, I want Mark and Vanessa to be surprised, and if you told me, I'll just, like, ruin everything.
are Mark and Vanessa your friends at school?
no, no, no. They're the adoptive parents.
Oh. Well, thank goodness for that.
what's that supposed to mean?
I just see a lot of teenage mothers come through here.
it's obviously a poisonous environment to raise a baby in.
how do you know that I'm so poisonous, you know?
like, what if these adoptive parents turn out to be, like, evil molesters?
or, like, stage parents?
they could be utterly negligent.
maybe they'll do a far shittier job of raising a kid than my dumbass stepdaughter ever would.
have you considered that?
no. I guess not.
Yeah. What is your job title exactly?
I'm an ultrasound technician, ma'am.
well, I'm a nail technician, and I think we both ought to stick to what we know.
excuse me?
Oh, you think you're so special 'cause you get to play picture pages up there?
my fiveyearold daughter could do that, and let me tell you, she's not the brightest bulb in the tanning bed.
so why don't you go back to night school in Manteno and learn a real trade?
Bren, use a dick!
I love it!
~ Please don't ever ~
~ Ever say we'll part ~
~ You scold ~
~ And you are so bold ~
~ Yes, together, yeah ~
~ I'm going to treat you right ~
~ Yeah, I'm going to treat you right. ~
Juno. Wow! I didn't expect to see you here.
I... I have something really cool to show you guys.
is Vanessa here?
uh... nope.
actually, she's working late tonight.
she's trying to accrue as much time off as she can before the...
Oh, right. I hear these are quite the time suck.
Yeah. You want to come on in?
I'm just having a ginseng cooler.
would you like one?
what is it with you rich people and your herbinfused juices?
it's probably got something to do with those 44packs they come in.
they're not bad, though.
wait a second. Why aren't you at work?
I work mostly from home. I'm a composer.
no shit?
like Johann Brahms or...?
no. More commercial stuff.
like what?
commercials.
Oh. Yeah.
have you seen the ads for the Titanium Power men's deodorant?
~ Get more snatch by the baaatch. ~
right. Paid for this kitchen.
Whoa!
you're quite the sellout, Mark.
I mean, what would the Melvins say?
did you say you had something to show me?
behold, good sir, your future child.
Hey, look at that.
I think it looks like my friend Paulie.
is he also bald and amorphous?
no. He's the dad.
Oh. Wow.
can you tell if it's a boy or a girl?
um... I can't.
the doctor can.
but I kind of want it to be a surprise.
well, it can only go one of two ways.
that's what you think.
I mean, I drink tons of booze, so you might end up with one of those scary neuter babies that's born without junk.
junk, huh?
Yeah. You know, its parts.
I know what junk is. Yeah, right.
we definitely want it to have some junk. Please.
you don't need to worry about a thing.
my stepmom, Bren, makes me eat super healthy, you know?
I can't stand in front of the microwave, and no red M&Ms
I hope you're ready.
Ooh. Do you hear that?
what?
this is my favorite song.
this is Sonic Youth doing "Superstar " by the Carpenters.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I know the Carpenters.
chick drummer, freaky dude not unlike the White Stripes.
you haven't heard the Carpenters like this.
just listen.
~ Your guitar ~
~ It sounds so sweet and clear... ~
Yeah. Yeah, I like this.
what... what did you say your favorite band was?
didn't. It's a threeway tie between the Stooges, Patti Smith and the Runaways.
I am definitely making you some CDs, at least while my kid's in there.
~ Don't you remember you told me you love me, baby... ~
the Wizard of Gore?
that is Herschell Gordon Lewis.
he's the ultimate master of horror.
please! Dario Argento is so the ultimate master of horror.
Argento? He's... he's all right.
but Lewis is completely demented.
okay? We're talking about buckets of goo.
I mean, there's red corn syrup all over the place.
there's fake brains coming out the yinyang.
quite frankly, this looks a little stupid.
give me the tape.
ugh...
this is even better than Suspiria.
What'd I tell you?
you have decent taste in slasher movies.
here's to dovetailing interests.
have you guys thought of any names for the baby yet?
uh, sort of, yes.
Vanessa likes Madison for a girl.
Madison?
wait, hold on.
isn't that, like, a little... gay?
wow, pretentious much?
should everyone just have a mysterious name like Juno?
no... you see, my dad went through this huge obsession with Roman and Greek mythology.
so he decided to name me after Zeus' wife.
I got it.
Zeus, like, he had tons of lays, but I'm pretty sure Juno was his only wife.
and she was supposed to be, like, really beautiful, but really mean.
like Diana Ross.
that suits you.
thanks?
you are something else.
Ah...
there's Vanessa. You'd better go.
what? Why?
she hates when I sit around and I watch movies and I don't contribute.
no, I'll handle this.
I'm really good at defusing momtype rage.
no, no, Juno...
Hey, seriously... Hey, Mark, where are you?!
I got some stuff... Hey, Vanessa.
Juno. What's going on? Oh, nothing.
what are you doing here? What's wrong?
I went to the doctor today.
is something wrong with the baby?
the baby's great.
it's the right size and everything.
I even saw its phalanges today.
here.
it's a baby.
Oh... It's your baby.
kind of looks like it's waving, you know.
like it's saying...
Hey, Vanessa, will you be my mom? "
Oh, it kind of does.
right?
Juno was nice enough to bring that over for us today.
Yeah, I came as soon as I got that ultrasound goo off my pelvis.
it was crazy actually.
my stepmom verbally abused the ultrasound tech and we got escorted off the premises.
wow, what kind of swag did you score?
mall madness, huh?
it's just some stuff I picked up for the baby.
don't you usually get all that stuff at like a baby shower?
cause my stepmom she was pregnant with my little sister and she got a million gifts, you know?
but I wasn't jealous, 'cause they all super lame.
I doubt anyone's going to throw us a shower.
why wouldn't they throw you a baby shower?
I don't think people know...
how to feel about the situation because it's... not set in stone.
what isn't set?
no, no, no, no, no.
you don't think that I'm going to flake out on you?
no, I don't, Juno.
we went through a situation before where it didn't work out.
Yeah, cold feet.
Oh.
you should have gone to China.
you know, 'cause I hear they give away babies like free iPods.
you know, they pretty much just put them in those Tshirt guns and shoot them out at sporting events.
your parents are probably wondering where you are.
Nah. I mean, I'm already pregnant, so what other kind of shenanigans could I get into?
though, I should... I should probably bounce.
Hey, don't forget your bag.
Oh, bag.
thank you.
okay, take care.
where the hell have you been, June bug?
I just drove to St. Cloud to show Mark and Vanessa the ultrasound.
I ended up staying for a couple hours.
a couple hours?!
what are you going over there in the first place?
Oh, they just... you know, they wanted to know about the stuff and I said I'd keep them updated, so I did.
well, you could have mailed it to them.
why would you drive an hour out to EastJesus Nowhere?
~ Mmmm! ~ I just did.
you know, and while Mark and I were waiting for Vanessa, we, uh, we watched The Wizard of Gore and then he burnt me a couple CDs of this weird music.
so, it was cool. He's kind of cool.
Juno, you can't just drop in on them like that.
no, it... it was not a big deal.
he was totally cool with it.
you don't understand.
mark is a married man.
there are boundaries.
Oh, come on.
listen, Brenda...
now you're acting like you're the one who has to go through this.
like you're the one who has to get huge and shove a baby out of your vag for someone else.
and what does it even matter if he's married?
I can have friends that are married.
it doesn't work that way, kiddo.
you don't know squat about the dynamics of marriage.
you don't know anything about me.
I know enough.
we don't even have a dog.
Yeah, we don't have a dog because you're allergic to their saliva.
I have sacrificed a lot for you, Juno, and in a couple years, when you move out, I'm going to get Weimaraners.
Oh, dream big.
Oh, go fly a kite!
Hey, Juno.
what can I do for you?
uh, Bleeker home?
Bleeker's mom was possibly attractive once, but now she looks like a hobbit.
you know the fat one that was in The Goonies?
Hey, man.
don't concentrate so hard.
I think I can smell your hair aburnin'.
Hey, what's up?
not much. I just... wanted to come say hey.
I mean, I miss like...just hanging out with you on school nights, you know.
orange tic tacs are Bleeker's one and only vice.
the day I got pregnant, his mouth tasted really tangy and delicious.
boy, you really... really seem to be getting, uh, pregnanter these days.
Yeah.
you know, I set up this whole private adoption, and this... this married couple in like St. Cloud, they're... they're going to be the parents.
so, it's... Really?
Yeah.
wow, what are they like?
well, I mean, the guy he's awesome.
his name is Mark and, um...
he likes old horror movies and he plays the guitar.
we actually hung out this afternoon.
is that normal?
probably not, but...
listen, I talked to Dad and Bren and they said they wouldn't narc you out to your folks, so...
okay.
I think we should be cool, you know?
that's a relief.
I'm gonna start looking like a pretty big dork soon.
you still going to think I'm cute when I'm huge?
I always think you're cute.
I think you're beautiful.
geez, Bleek.
I do.
Hey, June bug, you know, when this is all over we should get the band back together.
Yeah. I mean, that would be... that would be awesome.
I mean, once Tino gets the new drumhead, we're just, like, ready to rock.
and, I mean, we could...
we could always get back together, too.
it's an option.
Oh... were we together?
Yeah, we were once, you know... that... that time.
what about Katrina De Voort?
you could totally go out with Katrina De Voort.
I don't like Katrina.
she smells like soup.
I mean, have you ever smelled her?
and her whole house smells like soup.
okay...
so we have custard and cheesecake.
they're yellow.
right. I wanted to pick something that was genderneutral until we get the baby and then we can just add a more decisive palette.
why does everybody think yellow is genderneutral?
I don't know any guy with a yellow bedroom.
it's for babies.
I'm thinking more custard.
just with this light.
I don't know, maybe I should I should paint a larger swatch or just try it on a different wall...
or you can wait a few more months.
like the baby's going to come storming in here demanding dessertcolored walls.
what to Expect says that readying the baby's room is an important process for the woman.
especially if you're adopting.
it's called " nesting. "
nesting?
Yeah.
are you going to build a crib out of sticks and spit?
hmm?
well, you should read the book.
I flagged the daddy chapters. They're...
I think it's too early to paint.
that's my opinion.
I disagree.
this wall is going to need something.
our first family photo right in the middle.
right up there.
can you see it?
yum! This pretzel tastes like a friggin' donut.
well, share the love, sweetie.
no, you can't have any.
she's assaulting me.
she's denying me freshbaked goodness.
Oh, my God. What?
that's her.
that's Vanessa Loring.
of the PennySaver Lorings?
dude, she's, like, really pretty.
you sound, like, totally shocked or something.
she's totally going to, like, steal that little kid for her collection.
right? Seriously.
boring.
Ah...
Oh, I could so go for, like, a huge cookie right now with, like, a lamb kebab simultaneously.
God, spermie, must you always feed?
it's like never ending, pretty much, you know.
Juno!
Hi. Hi, Juno.
Vanessa, what, what brings you to the mall today?
I was just shopping, you know, with my girlfriends, and...
you're gay?
no. Oh, please, just ignore her.
okay.
well, how are you feeling?
great. Everything's stupendous, you know.
Oh, coming in on that snooze button.
Wow. It's incredible.
huh. Oh, God.
what?
kicking... kicking away.
could... could I feel it?
are you kidding?
Oh.
God, that's cool.
everyone's just, like, grabbing my belly all the time.
it's crazy, but I'm a legend, you know.
they call me the cautionary whale.
I can't feel anything.
it's not moving for me.
well, you should try talking to it, 'cause, like, supposedly they can hear you even though it's all, like, 1 0, 000 leagues under the sea.
Hi, baby.
um...
it's me.
it's... Vanessa.
I can't wait to meet you.
can you hear me, baby?
sweet angel?
I felt him!
Oh, God.
that was magical.
thank you. Thank you.
~ Elope with me, Miss Private ~
~ And we'll sail around the world ~
~ I will be your Ferdinand and you my wayward girl ~
~ How many nights of talking in hotel rooms can you take? ~
~ How many nights of limping 'round some pagan holidays? ~
~ Oh, elope with me in private ~
~ And we'll set something ablaze ~
~ A trail for the devil to erase... ~
~ And... if you can't, if you can't decide ~
~ Between a little breakfast and lunch ~
~ Why don't you microwave yourself ~
~ A little bowl of brunch? ~
Hello?
Hey!
Hi.
so, um,
I've been listening to that really weird CD that you made me.
Yeah, what's the verdict?
well, it's cute.
it's cute " ?
when you're used to listening to the raw power of Iggy and The Stooges, everything else just sounds kind of like...
precious in comparison.
well, I imagine you've got a collection of punk chestnuts to prove your point.
well... consider it your musical education.
can't wait to see what you've got to teach me.
stop surfing porn and get back to work.
I just wanted to call and say hi.
right. Go learn something.
I'll have a little trip down Mexico way.
and Greece and China apparently.
how many months has it been now?
you're getting huge.
Oh, it's honing in on eight.
you should see how weird I look naked.
I wish my fun bags would get bigger.
God, trust me, you don't.
I have to actually wear a frickin' bra now and rub all this nasty cocoa butter stuff on myself so, like... I don't know, my skin won't explode.
hot.
why is everyone always staring at me?
well, you are kind of convex, you know.
who's been doing their geometry homework for once?
I have no choice.
Keith's been grading me, like, so hard lately.
do not call Mr. Connors Keith.
Why?
cause my barf reflex is really heightened these days.
but Keith's hot.
EW, he's all beardy.
did you hear that Bleek is going to prom with Katrina De Voort?
Katrina?!
no, way, no, he doesn't like Katrina.
must be, like, a pity date or something.
I heard he asked her.
and that they're going to Benihana and then prom and then Vijay's parents' cabin.
Oh, what're you talk...
he told me that Katrina's house smells like soup.
Oh. Oh, my God, it totally does.
I was there, like, four years ago for a birthday party.
Oh, my God, it's like Lipton Landing.
but, you know, boys have endured way worse things for nookie.
Oh, please.
there is no way that they're having sex.
I mean, they wouldn't even be holding hands.
Oh, I wouldn't be so sure. He did it with you.
Yeah, 'cause Bleek trusts me, you know.
we're best friends.
are you jealous?
I thought you said you didn't care what he did.
not jealous, don't care.
it's just, I know Bleek doesn't like Katrina, you know.
he shouldn't toy with her emotions like that, 'cause she seems pretty nice.
Uhhuh, I'm really convinced.
you know, prom is for weenuses anyway.
as soon as you you're old enough to go, it's so not cool anymore.
are you honestly and truly going to prom with Katrina De Voort?
uh, hi.
Leah justjust said that you were going to go with her.
Yeah, I did ask her if she wanted to go.
um, a bunch of us from the team are going to go to Benihana and then go to the prom and then go to Vijay's parents' cabin, so...
Wewewe're getting a stretch limo.
your mom must be pretty stoked that you're not taking me.
you're mad. Why are you mad?
I'm not mad. I'm in a...
I'm in a great mood.
I mean, despite the fact that well, I'm in a fat suit that I can't take off and despite the fact that pretty much everyone's making fun of me behind my back and despite the fact that your little girlfriend gave me the stink eye in art class yesterday...
katrina's not my girlfriend, all right?
and I doubt that she gave you the stink eye.
that's just... the way her face looks, you know.
that's just her face.
Yeah, what... Youyou just take Soupy Sales to prom.
I can think of so many cooler things to do that night.
like, you know what, Bleek?
I might pumice my feet.
I might go to Bren's dumb Unitarian Church.
maybe get hit by a truck full of hot garbage juice, you know, 'cause all those things would be exponentially cooler than going to prom with you.
you're being really immature.
you have no reason to be mad at me.
I mean, you know, you broke my heart.
I... I should be royally ticked off at you, you know.
I should be really cheesed off.
I shouldn't want to talk to you anymore.
Ooh, what, 'cause I got bored and had sex with you and I didn't want to, like, marry you?
like I'd marry you? You'd be the meanest wife ever, okay? And I know that you weren't bored that day, because there was a lot of stuff on TV, andand the Blair Witch Project was coming on Starz.
and you were like, " I haven't seen this since it came out. "
and if so, we should watch it.
and then but, " Oh, no, we should make out instead, " la, la, la.
you just, you just take Katrina the douche packer to prom.
I'm, I'm sure you two will have, like, a real bitchin' time.
well, I still have your underwear.
I still... I have your virginity.
would you shut up?
what, are you ashamed that we did it?
no.
because at least you don't have to have the evidence under your sweater.
I'm a planet.
wait, wait, let me get your bag.
you shouldn't be carrying...
what's another ten pounds?
~ Monday morning wake up ~
~ Knowing that you got to go to school~
~ Tell you mum what to expect ~
~ She says it's right out of the blue ~
~ Do you want to work in Debenham's? ~
~ 'Cause that's what they expect ~
~ Start in lingerie, and Doris is your supervisor ~
~ And the head said that you always ~
~ Were a queer one from the start ~
~ For careers~
~you say you want to be remembered for your art ~
~ Your obsession gets you known ~
~ Throughout the school for being strange ~
~ Making lifesize models... ~
Hi. Wow. Hi.
shirt's working hard.
is Vanessa here?
no. We are safe.
sweet.
I'm glad you're here.
I actually have something for you. Come here.
~ And the rumor is you never go with boys~
~ and you are tight... ~
almost there.
~ So they jab you with a fork ~
~ You drop the tray and go berserk... ~
whoa, Mark, is this the baby's room?
it's beautiful.
Oh, that's hilarious.
now, this is where I keep all my old comics, Huh. and I want to show you one.
you're one of those guys?
take a look.
huh?
most Fruitful Yuki.
Mmhmm.
is this a pregnant superhero?
isn't that great?
I found it in Japan when I was there with my band.
it reminds me of you.
Hells, yeah! Yeah.
this actually makes me feel way less of a fat dork.
well, Yuki is a real badass.
you should be very proud to be in the same condition.
thank you. Yeah.
Oh, how about some tuneage?
tuneage? Yeah.
I got a bunch... All right, don't look. Numero trois.
not looking.
um, okay, this one is actually kind of slow, but it's Mott The Hoople, so it's still totally rad...
what? I know this one.
you do? Yeah.
this song is older than I am, if you can believe it.
I danced to this at my senior prom.
who'd you dance with?
Cynthia Vogel. Great dance partner.
she let me put my hands all over her butt. Hot.
very hot.
I can just totally picture you dancing like a total dork.
actually...
I put my hands down here.
Ththis, this... this is how we did it in '88.
like this? Just like this.
have you ever been to a dance before?
dances are for nerds and squares.
what are you?
I don't know.
does it feel like there's something between us?
~ All the young dudes ~ ~ Hey, dudes ~
~ Carry the news ~
~ Where are you? ~
~ Stand up ~
~ Carry the news ~
I'm leaving Vanessa.
~ Carry the news ~
What?! Getting a place in the city.
got it all planned.
this is something I've been wanting to do for a long time.
no. No?
no, you definitely... can't do that.
that's one big, fat sack of... no!
what is the matter? Wh did I do...
I mean... you guys are supposed to take care of this, you know?
I thought you'd be cool with this. Cool?
II want things to be perfect.
I don't want them to be shitty and broken like everyone else's family.
look, I'll have the baby, and Vanessa's going to be so happy.
you just...
a baby's not going to fix everything, besides I don't know if I'm even ready to be a father.
but you're old.
how do you think of me?
you know, why are you over here?
I... I just like being a piece of furniture in your weird life.
this? This is what my life has become.
I mean, you know, I got stuff in boxes.
you know, I'm underground.
that's appealing to you?
is this my fault? No.
is Vanessa, like, mad at you because of me or something?
that's got nothing to do with it.
Vanessa and I aren't in love anymore.
well, you were in love when you married her.
and if you're in love once, you can be in love again like my friend, Leah, who's been with the same guy, like, four different times.
you're just not trying hard enough. I'm such an idiot.
I can't believe what an idiot I am.
no, no, you know what, Mark...
just do not divorce your wife.
will you please just do me a solid and stay with Vanessa?
you're so young.
Oh, I'm not that young. Okay, I'm 1 6.
all right, I'm old enough to know when someone's acting like a total ahole.
Oh, and you know what?
I bought another Sonic Youth album and it sucks!
it's just noise.
Juno? What's going on?
nothing.
why are you crying?
I'm not crying,
I'm just allergic to fine home furnishings.
hold on. What's the matter?
what's the matter?
just a little hormonal.
right, Juno?
just part of the process.
what did you do?
I didn't do anything.
just, um...
I've been thinking...
what? You know, I've just
I'm thinking if this is the right thing.
what are you talking about?
just wondering if it's...
just wondering if we're ready.
Yeah, we're ready.
we're ready. We've read the books.
we've taken all the classes.
we've have a nursery that is completely... Vanessa.
I know we're prepared.
I'm just wondering if... I'm ready.
wait a minute.
wait, Juno, don't listen to him.
he's just got cold feet.
he's just being a guy.
the books all say the same thing.
a woman becomes a mother when she gets pregnant.
a man becomes a father when he sees his baby. "
he's going to get there.
he's... he's going to get there. It happened so fast.
you know, we put the ad in the paper and I thought that it was going to take months, if at all, and then, two weeks later, she's on that couch.
well, she answered our prayers.
ever since then, it's been, like, a ticking clock.
what are you saying?
that it feels a little like bad timing.
what would be a good time for you, Mark?
there's just some things that I still want to do.
like what? Be a rock star?
don't mock me.
I'm just saying that this is... this is something that's never going to happen.
you know... your shirt is stupid.
grow up.
if I have to wait for you to become Kurt Cobain,
I'm never going to be a mother.
I never said I'd be a good father.
I called Gerta Rouse and she said that she can represent both of us.
it's called a" collaborative divorce. "
it's all the rage right now, supposedly.
it'd be pretty easy 'cause we don't have any children.
thanks for making the call, I guess.
have you found a place to stay yet?
Yeah, downtown.
a hotel?
no, it's not a hotel, it's a loft.
well, aren't you the cool guy.
I wanted a baby so bad.
I know.
this looks like a bill from Jun...
it's for me.
I never realize how much I like being home unless I've been somewhere really different for a while.
Hey, Dad.
Hey, big puffy version ofJune bug.
where you been?
Oh, just out dealing with things way beyond my maturity level.
where is everybody?
well, Bren took Liberty Bell to her tot iceskating class.
when will you guys learn that tots can't iceskate?
you're looking a little morose, honey.
what's eating you?
Oh...
I'm just, like, losing my faith with humanity.
wow, can you narrow that down for me?
I just... wonder if, like, two people can stay together for good.
you mean, like couples?
Yeah, like... people in love.
are you having boy trouble?
cause I got to be honest, I don't really much approve of you dating in your condition.
that's... that's kind of messed up.
no, Dad, it's not... I mean, that's pretty skanky.
isn't that what you girls call it skanky?
Skivvy? Please stop.
tore up from the floor up?
that's... that's not what it's about, it...
I just... I need to know that it's possible that two people can stay happy together forever.
well, it's not easy, that's for sure.
and, uh, I don't have the best track record in the world,
I know, but...
I've been with your stepmother for ten years now, and, um, I'm proud to say, we're very happy.
look...
in my opinion, the best thing you can do is find a person who loves you for exactly what you are.
good mood, bad mood...
ugly, pretty...
the right person's still gonna think the sun shines out your ass.
that's the kind of person that's worth sticking with.
Yeah.
Yeah, and I think I've found that person.
Yeah, sure you have your dear old DAD.
you know I'll always be there to love you and support you no matter what kind of pickle you're in.
obviously.
dad, I think I'm just gonna like... shove out for a sec, but I won't be home late.
okay.
you were talking about me, right?
Oh, yeah.
come on! Tic tac ahoy!
~ The flower said, "I wish I was a tree " ~
~ The tree said, " I wish I could be a different kind of tree " ~
~ The cat wished that it was a bee ~
~ The turtle wished that it could fly ~
~ Really high into the sky ~
~ Over rooftops and then dive deep into the sea ~
~ And in the sea there is a fish ~
~ A fish that has a secret wish ~
~ A wish to be a big cactus with a pink flower on it ~
~ And in the sea there is a fish ~
~ A fish that has a secret wish ~
~ A wish to be a big cactus with a pink flower on it... ~
Hi.
Hey, did you put, like, a hundred things of tic tacs in my mailbox?
Oh, yeah. Yeah, that was me.
Why?
well, you know, they're your fave, and, uh, I mean, you can never have too many of your favorite onecalorie breath mints.
so, I just thought I'd...
Yeah, well, thanks.
I, uh, I think I'm pretty much set until college on the tic tac front.
you know, Bleek, I was thinking... and I'm sorry I was such a huge bitch to you.
you don't deserve it.
it's okay, you know... it's okay.
and also, um...
I think I'm in love with you.
you mean, as friends?
no. I mean, for real.
cause you're, like, the coolest person I've ever met, and you don't even have to try.
I try really hard, actually.
you're, like, naturally smart, and you're not like everyone else.
you don't stare at my stomach all the time.
you look at my face, and every time I see you, the baby starts kicking super hard.
it does?
wizard.
I think it's 'cause my heart starts pounding every time I see you.
mine, too.
that's all I could ask for.
you're golden, man.
can we make out now?
Yeah.

~ We're not lovers ~
~ You're so nice ~
~ And you're so smart ~
~ You're such a good friend, I have to break your heart ~
~ I'll tell you that I love you ~

breathe! Breathe!
out of the way! Out of the way!
stop it. For God's sake, stop it.
don't do that. What?
don't... But it's fun!
God, Bren, when do I get the friggin' spinal tap thing?!
it's called a spinal block, and you can't have it yet, honey.
the doctor said you're not dilated enough.
Oh, come on! I mean, it's like...
I have to wait for it to get worse?
why can't I just have the friggin' thing now?
well, honey, doctors are sadists who like to play God and watch lesser people scream.
Oh, shit! Uh, excuse me!
Hey, could we give my kid the damn spinal tap already?!
breath and push.
that's good. Keep pushing.
keep pushing, keep pushing...

~ Here is the church and here is the steeple ~
~ We sure are cute for two ugly people... ~
I decided not to call Bleeker to tell him that I was having the baby.
he had a big meet against Manteno and I didn't want him to get all worried about me.
Paulie Bleeker has just broken a district record...
but he figured it out anyway.
~ But you. ~
someday, you'll be back here, honey... on your terms.
Hi.
nice legs.
~ Come with me ~
~ My love ~
~ To the sea... ~
Bleeker decided he didn't want to see the baby.
neither did I really.
he didn't feel like ours.
~ ...How much... ~
I think he was always hers.
would you like to meet your son?
I have a son.

he is the cheese to my macaroni.
and I know people are supposed to fall in love before they reproduce, but I guess normalcy isn't really our style.

kind of looks like it's waving, you know.
like it's saying...
Hey, Vanessa, will you be my mom?
Oh, it kind of does.
right?
Juno was nice enough to bring that over for us today.
Yeah, I came as soon as I got that ultrasound goo off my pelvis.
it was crazy actually.
my stepmom verbally abused the ultrasound tech and we got escorted off the premises.
wow, what kind of swag did you score?
mall madness, huh?
it's just some stuff I picked up for the baby.
don't you usually get all that stuff at like a baby shower?
cause my stepmom she was pregnant with my little sister and she got a million gifts, you know?
but I wasn't jealous, 'cause they all super lame.
I doubt anyone's going to throw us a shower.
why wouldn't they throw you a baby shower?
I don't think people know...
how to feel about the situation because it's... not set in stone.
what isn't set?
no, no, no, no, no.
you don't think that I'm going to flake out on you?
no, I don't, Juno.
we went through a situation before where it didn't work out.
Yeah, cold feet.
Oh.
you should have gone to China.
you know, 'cause I hear they give away babies like free iPods.
you know, they pretty much just put them in those Tshirt guns and shoot them out at sporting events.
your parents are probably wondering where you are.
Nah. I mean, I'm already pregnant, so what other kind of shenanigans could I get into?
though, I should... I should probably bounce.
Hey, don't forget your bag.
Oh, bag.
thank you.
okay, take care.
where the hell have you been, June bug?
I just drove to St. Cloud to show Mark and Vanessa the ultrasound.
I ended up staying for a couple hours.
a couple hours?!
what are you going over there in the first place?
Oh, they just... you know, they wanted to know about the stuff and I said I'd keep them updated, so I did.
well, you could have mailed it to them.
why would you drive an hour out to EastJesus Nowhere?
~ Mmmm! ~ I just did.
you know, and while Mark and I were waiting for Vanessa, we, uh, we watched The Wizard of Gore and then he burnt me a couple CDs of this weird music.
so, it was cool. He's kind of cool.
Juno, you can't just drop in on them like that.
no, it... it was not a big deal.
he was totally cool with it.
you don't understand.
mark is a married man.
there are boundaries.
Oh, come on.
listen, Brenda...
now you're acting like you're the one who has to go through this.
like you're the one who has to get huge and shove a baby out of your vag for someone else.
and what does it even matter if he's married?
I can have friends that are married.
it doesn't work that way, kiddo.
you don't know squat about the dynamics of marriage.
you don't know anything about me.
I know enough.
we don't even have a dog.
Yeah, we don't have a dog because you're allergic to their saliva.
I have sacrificed a lot for you, Juno, and in a couple years, when you move out, I'm going to get Weimaraners.
Oh, dream big.
Oh, go fly a kite!
Hey, Juno.
what can I do for you?
uh, Bleeker home?
Bleeker's mom was possibly attractive once, but now she looks like a hobbit.
you know the fat one that was in The Goonies?
Hey, man.
don't concentrate so hard.
I think I can smell your hair aburnin'.
Hey, what's up?
not much. I just... wanted to come say hey.
I mean, I miss like...just hanging out with you on school nights, you know.
orange tic tacs are Bleeker's one and only vice.
the day I got pregnant, his mouth tasted really tangy and delicious.
boy, you really... really seem to be getting, uh, pregnanter these days.
Yeah.
you know, I set up this whole private adoption, and this... this married couple in like St. Cloud, they're... they're going to be the parents.
so, it's... Really?
Yeah.
wow, what are they like?
well, I mean, the guy he's awesome.
his name is Mark and, um...
he likes old horror movies and he plays the guitar.
we actually hung out this afternoon.
is that normal?
probably not, but...
listen, I talked to Dad and Bren and they said they wouldn't narc you out to your folks, so...
okay.
I think we should be cool, you know?
that's a relief.
I'm gonna start looking like a pretty big dork soon.
you still going to think I'm cute when I'm huge?
I always think you're cute.
I think you're beautiful.
geez, Bleek.
I do.
Hey, June bug, you know, when this is all over we should get the band back together.
Yeah. I mean, that would be... that would be awesome.
I mean, once Tino gets the new drumhead, we're just, like, ready to rock.
and, I mean, we could...
we could always get back together, too.
it's an option.
Oh... were we together?
Yeah, we were once, you know... that... that time.
what about Katrina De Voort?
you could totally go out with Katrina De Voort.
I don't like Katrina.
she smells like soup.
I mean, have you ever smelled her?
and her whole house smells like soup.
okay...
so we have custard and cheesecake.
they're yellow.
right. I wanted to pick something that was genderneutral until we get the baby and then we can just add a more decisive palette.
why does everybody think yellow is genderneutral?
I don't know any guy with a yellow bedroom.
it's for babies.
I'm thinking more custard.
just with this light.
I don't know, maybe I should I should paint a larger swatch or just try it on a different wall...
or you can wait a few more months.
like the baby's going to come storming in here demanding dessertcolored walls.
what to Expect says that readying the baby's room is an important process for the woman.
especially if you're adopting.
it's called " nesting. "
nesting?
Yeah.
are you going to build a crib out of sticks and spit?
hmm?
well, you should read the book.
I flagged the daddy chapters. They're...
I think it's too early to paint.
that's my opinion.
I disagree.
this wall is going to need something.
our first family photo right in the middle.
right up there.
can you see it?
yum! This pretzel tastes like a friggin' donut.
well, share the love, sweetie.
no, you can't have any.
she's assaulting me.
she's denying me freshbaked goodness.
Oh, my God. What?
that's her.
that's Vanessa Loring.
of the PennySaver Lorings?
dude, she's, like, really pretty.
you sound, like, totally shocked or something.
she's totally going to, like, steal that little kid for her collection.
right? Seriously.
boring.
Ah...
Oh, I could so go for, like, a huge cookie right now with, like, a lamb kebab simultaneously.
God, spermie, must you always feed?
it's like never ending, pretty much, you know.
Juno!
Hi. Hi, Juno.
Vanessa, what, what brings you to the mall today?
I was just shopping, you know, with my girlfriends, and...
you're gay?
no. Oh, please, just ignore her.
okay.
well, how are you feeling?
great. Everything's stupendous, you know.
Oh, coming in on that snooze button.
Wow. It's incredible.
huh. Oh, God.
what?
kicking... kicking away.
could... could I feel it?
are you kidding?
Oh.
God, that's cool.
everyone's just, like, grabbing my belly all the time.
it's crazy, but I'm a legend, you know.
they call me the cautionary whale.
I can't feel anything.
it's not moving for me.
well, you should try talking to it, 'cause, like, supposedly they can hear you even though it's all, like, 1 0, 000 leagues under the sea.
Hi, baby.
um...
it's me.
it's... Vanessa.
I can't wait to meet you.
can you hear me, baby?
sweet angel?
I felt him!
Oh, God.
that was magical.
thank you. Thank you.
~ Elope with me, Miss Private ~
~ And we'll sail around the world ~
~ I will be your Ferdinand and you my wayward girl ~
~ How many nights of talking in hotel rooms can you take? ~
~ How many nights of limping 'round some pagan holidays? ~
~ Oh, elope with me in private ~
~ And we'll set something ablaze ~
~ A trail for the devil to erase... ~
~ And... if you can't, if you can't decide ~
~ Between a little breakfast and lunch ~
~ Why don't you microwave yourself ~
~ A little bowl of brunch? ~
Hello?
Hey!
Hi.
so, um,
I've been listening to that really weird CD that you made me.
Yeah, what's the verdict?
well, it's cute.
it's cute " ?
when you're used to listening to the raw power of Iggy and The Stooges, everything else just sounds kind of like...
precious in comparison.
well, I imagine you've got a collection of punk chestnuts to prove your point.
well... consider it your musical education.
can't wait to see what you've got to teach me.
stop surfing porn and get back to work.
I just wanted to call and say hi.
right. Go learn something.
I'll have a little trip down Mexico way.
and Greece and China apparently.
how many months has it been now?
you're getting huge.
Oh, it's honing in on eight.
you should see how weird I look naked.
I wish my fun bags would get bigger.
God, trust me, you don't.
I have to actually wear a frickin' bra now and rub all this nasty cocoa butter stuff on myself so, like... I don't know, my skin won't explode.
hot.
why is everyone always staring at me?
well, you are kind of convex, you know.
who's been doing their geometry homework for once?
I have no choice.
Keith's been grading me, like, so hard lately.
do not call Mr. Connors Keith.
Why?
cause my barf reflex is really heightened these days.
but Keith's hot.
EW, he's all beardy.
did you hear that Bleek is going to prom with Katrina De Voort?
Katrina?!
no way, no, he doesn't like Katrina.
must be, like, a pity date or something.
I heard he asked her.
and that they're going to Benihana and then prom and then Vijay's parents' cabin.
Oh, what're you talk...
he told me that Katrina's house smells like soup.
Oh. Oh, my God, it totally does.
I was there, like, four years ago for a birthday party.
Oh, my God, it's like Lipton Landing.
but, you know, boys have endured way worse things for nookie.
Oh, please.
there is no way that they're having sex.
I mean, they wouldn't even be holding hands.
Oh, I wouldn't be so sure. He did it with you.
Yeah, 'cause Bleek trusts me, you know.
we're best friends.
are you jealous?
I thought you said you didn't care what he did.
not jealous, don't care.
it's just, I know Bleek doesn't like Katrina, you know.
he shouldn't toy with her emotions like that, 'cause she seems pretty nice.
Uhhuh, I'm really convinced.
you know, prom is for weenuses anyway.
as soon as you you're old enough to go, it's so not cool anymore.
are you honestly and truly going to prom with Katrina De Voort?
uh, hi.
Leah just just said that you were going to go with her.
Yeah, I did ask her if she wanted to go.
um, a bunch of us from the team are going to go to Benihana and then go to the prom and then go to Vijay's parents' cabin, so...
Wewewe're getting a stretch limo.
your mom must be pretty stoked that you're not taking me.
you're mad. Why are you mad?
I'm not mad. I'm in a...
I'm in a great mood.
I mean, despite the fact that well, I'm in a fat suit that I can't take off and despite the fact that pretty much everyone's making fun of me behind my back and despite the fact that your little girlfriend gave me the stink eye in art class yesterday...
katrina's not my girlfriend, all right?
and I doubt that she gave you the stink eye.
that's just... the way her face looks, you know.
that's just her face.
Yeah, what... Youyou just take Soupy Sales to prom.
I can think of so many cooler things to do that night.
like, you know what, Bleek?
I might pumice my feet.
I might go to Bren's dumb Unitarian Church.
maybe get hit by a truck full of hot garbage juice, you know, 'cause all those things would be exponentially cooler than going to prom with you.
you're being really immature.
you have no reason to be mad at me.
I mean, you know, you broke my heart.
I... I should be royally ticked off at you, you know.
I should be really cheesed off.
I shouldn't want to talk to you anymore.
Ooh, what, 'cause I got bored and had sex with you and I didn't want to, like, marry you?
like I'd marry you? You'd be the meanest wife ever, okay? And I know that you weren't bored that day, because there was a lot of stuff on TV, andand the Blair Witch Project was coming on Starz.
and you were like, " I haven't seen this since it came out. "
and if so, we should watch it.
and then but, " Oh, no, we should make out instead, " la, la, la.
you just, you just take Katrina the douche packer to prom.
I'm, I'm sure you two will have, like, a real bitchin' time.
well, I still have your underwear.
I still... I have your virginity.
would you shut up?
what, are you ashamed that we did it?
no.
because at least you don't have to have the evidence under your sweater.
I'm a planet.
wait, wait, let me get your bag.
you shouldn't be carrying...
what's another ten pounds?
~ Monday morning wake up ~
~ Knowing that you got to go to school~

Hi. Wow. Hi.
shirt's working hard.
is Vanessa here?
no. We are safe.
sweet.
I'm glad you're here.
I actually have something for you. Come here.
~ And the rumor is you never go with boys~
~ and you are tight... ~
almost there.
~ So they jab you with a fork ~
~ You drop the tray and go berserk... ~
whoa, Mark, is this the baby's room?
it's beautiful.
Oh, that's hilarious.
now, this is where I keep all my old comics, Huh. and I want to show you one.
you're one of those guys?
take a look.
huh?
most Fruitful Yuki.
Mmhmm.
is this a pregnant superhero?
isn't that great?
I found it in Japan when I was there with my band.
it reminds me of you.
Hells, yeah! Yeah.
this actually makes me feel way less of a fat dork.
well, Yuki is a real badass.
you should be very proud to be in the same condition.
thank you. Yeah.
Oh, how about some tuneage?
tuneage? Yeah.
I got a bunch... All right, don't look. Numero trois.
not looking.
um, okay, this one is actually kind of slow, but it's Mott The Hoople, so it's still totally rad... and hardcore.
what? I know this one.
you do? Yeah.
this song is older than I am, if you can believe it.
I danced to this at my senior prom.
who'd you dance with?
Cynthia Vogel. Great dance partner.
she let me put my hands all over her butt. Hot.
very hot.
I can just totally picture you dancing like a total dork.
actually... her hands... were there.
I put my hands down here.
this, this... this is how we did it in '88.
like this? Just like this.
have you ever been to a dance before?
dances are for nerds and squares.
what are you?
I don't know.
does it feel like there's something between us?
~ All the young dudes ~ ~ Hey, dudes ~
~ Carry the news ~
~ Where are you? ~
~ Stand up ~
~ Carry the news ~
I'm leaving Vanessa.
~ Carry the news ~
What?! Getting a place in the city.
got it all planned.
this is something I've been wanting to do for a long time.
no. No?
no, you definitely... can't do that.
that's one big, fat sack of... no!
what is the matter? What did I...
I mean... you guys are supposed to take care of this, you know?
I thought you'd be cool with this. Cool?
II want things to be perfect.
I don't want them to be shitty and broken like everyone else's family.
look, I'll have the baby, and Vanessa's going to be so happy.
you just...
a baby's not going to fix everything, besides I don't know if I'm even ready to be a father.
but you're old.
how do you think of me?
you know, why are you over here?
I... I just like being a piece of furniture in your weird life.
this? This is what my life has become.
I mean, you know, I got stuff in boxes.
you know, I'm underground.
that's appealing to you?
is this my fault? No.
is Vanessa, like, mad at you because of me or something?
that's got nothing to do with it.
Vanessa and I aren't in love anymore.
well, you were in love when you married her.
and if you're in love once, you can be in love again like my friend, Leah, who's been with the same guy, like, four different times.
you're just not trying hard enough. I'm such an idiot.
I can't believe what an idiot I am.
no, no, you know what, Mark...
just do not divorce your wife.
will you please just do me a solid and stay with Vanessa?
you're so young.
Oh, I'm not that young. Okay, I'm 1 6.
all right, I'm old enough to know when someone's acting like a total ahole.
Oh, and you know what?
I bought another Sonic Youth album and it sucks!
it's just noise.
Juno? What's going on?
nothing.
why are you crying?
I'm not crying,
I'm just allergic to fine home furnishings.
hold on. What's the matter?
what's the matter?
just a little hormonal.
right, Juno?
just part of the process.
what did you do?
I didn't do anything.
just, um...
I've been thinking...
what? You know, I've just
I'm thinking if this is the right thing.
what are you talking about?
just wondering if it's...
just wondering if we're ready.
Yeah, we're ready.
we're ready. We've read the books.
we've taken all the classes.
we've have a nursery that is completely... Vanessa.
I know we're prepared.
I'm just wondering if... I'm ready.
wait a minute.
wait, Juno, don't listen to him.
he's just got cold feet.
he's just being a guy.
the books all say the same thing.
a woman becomes a mother when she gets pregnant.
a man becomes a father when he sees his baby.
he's going to get there.
he's... he's going to get there. It happened so fast.
you know, we put the ad in the paper and I thought that it was going to take months, if at all, and then, two weeks later, she's on that couch.
well, she answered our prayers.
ever since then, it's been, like, a ticking clock.
what are you saying?
that it feels a little like bad timing.
what would be a good time for you, Mark?
there's just some things that I still want to do.
like what? Be a rock star?
don't mock me.
I'm just saying that this is... this is something that's never going to happen.
you know... your shirt is stupid.
grow up.
if I have to wait for you to become Kurt Cobain,
I'm never going to be a mother.
I never said I'd be a good father.
I called Gerta Rouse and she said that she can represent both of us.
it's called a "collaborative divorce. "
it's all the rage right now, supposedly.
it'd be pretty easy 'cause we don't have any children.
thanks for making the call, I guess.
have you found a place to stay yet?
Yeah, downtown.
a hotel?
no, it's not a hotel, it's a loft.
well, aren't you the cool guy.
I wanted a baby so bad.
I know.
this looks like a bill from Jun...
it's for me.
I never realize how much I like being home unless I've been somewhere really different for a while.
Hey, Dad.
Hey, big puffy version ofJune bug.
where you been?
Oh, just out dealing with things way beyond my maturity level.
where is everybody?
well, Bren took Liberty Bell to her tot iceskating class.
when will you guys learn that tots can't iceskate?
you're looking a little morose, honey.
what's eating you?
Oh...
I'm just, like, losing my faith with humanity.
wow, can you narrow that down for me?
I just... wonder if, like, two people can stay together for good.
you mean, like couples?
Yeah, like... people in love.
are you having boy trouble?
cause I got to be honest, I don't really much approve of you dating in your condition.
that's... that's kind of messed up.
no, Dad, it's not... I mean, that's pretty skanky.
isn't that what you girls call it skanky?
Skivvy? Please stop.
tore up from the floor up?
that's... that's not what it's about, it...
I just... I need to know that it's possible that two people can stay happy together forever.
well, it's not easy, that's for sure.
and, uh, I don't have the best track record in the world,
I know, but...
I've been with your stepmother for ten years now, and, um, I'm proud to say, we're very happy.
look...
in my opinion, the best thing you can do is find a person who loves you for exactly what you are.
good mood, bad mood...
ugly, pretty...handsome, what have you.
the right person's still gonna think the sun shines out your ass.
that's the kind of person that's worth sticking with.
Yeah.
Yeah, and I think I've found that person.
Yeah, sure you have your dear old DAD.
you know I'll always be there to love you and support you no matter what kind of pickle you're in.
obviously.
dad, I think I'm just gonna like... shove out for a sec, but I won't be home late.
okay.
you were talking about me, right?
Oh, yeah.
come on! Tic tac ahoy!
~ The flower said, "I wish I was a tree " ~
~ The tree said, " I wish I could be a different kind of tree " ~
~ The cat wished that it was a bee ~
~ The turtle wished that it could fly ~
~ Really high into the sky ~
~ Over rooftops and then dive deep into the sea ~
~ And in the sea there is a fish ~
~ A fish that has a secret wish ~
~ A wish to be a big cactus with a pink flower on it ~
~ And in the sea there is a fish ~
~ A fish that has a secret wish ~
~ A wish to be a big cactus with a pink flower on it... ~
Hi.
Hey, did you put, like, a hundred things of tic tacs in my mailbox?
Oh, yeah. Yeah, that was me.
Why?
well, you know, they're your fave, and, uh, I mean, you can never have too many of your favorite onecalorie breath mints.
so, I just thought I'd...
Yeah, well, thanks.
I, uh, I think I'm pretty much set until college on the tic tac front.
you know, Bleek, I was thinking... and I'm sorry I was such a huge bitch to you.
you don't deserve it.
it's okay, you know... it's okay.
and also, um...
I think I'm in love with you.
you mean, as friends?
no. I mean, for real.
cause you're, like, the coolest person I've ever met, and you don't even have to try.
I try really hard, actually.
you're, like, naturally smart, and you're not like everyone else.
you don't stare at my stomach all the time.
you look at my face, and every time I see you, the baby starts kicking super hard.
it does?
wizard.
I think it's 'cause my heart starts pounding every time I see you.
mine, too.
that's all I could ask for.
you're golden, man.
can we make out now?
Yeah.

it's called a spinal block, and you can't have it yet, honey.
the doctor said you're not dilated enough.
Oh, come on! I mean, it's like...
I have to wait for it to get worse?
why can't I just have the friggin' thing now?
well, honey, doctors are sadists who like to play God and watch lesser people scream.
Oh, shit! Uh, excuse me!
Hey, could we give my kid the damn spinal tap already?!
breath and push.
that's good. Keep pushing.
keep pushing, keep pushing...

all drivers to your cars, please.
all drivers to your cars.
distracted? No, that's not exactly right.
your son seems to be interested in only one thing.
all he talks about, all he seems capable of thinking about is automobile racing.
well, you know, his father designs racing cars.
and where is your husband?
working. He couldn't be here.
perhaps the apple hasn't fallen very far from the tree.
is your husband's name Rex?
no, that's his older brother, Rex. Why?
this is the test he turned in last week.
all right, pencils down.
take your answer sheets place it into the first part of your booklet...
pack up your things and bring your... to my desk.
speed Racer, slow down!
take it you're ready to go?
how was school? Fine.
are you going to the track? Mom said you were.
you don't have to drop me off. I could just go with you.
no way. Oh, come on.
take me with you. Come on, please.
I can't, Speed.
pops would kill me. He doesn't have to know.
I won't say anything. Nobody will know.
come on, please, Rex. Please, please, please.
are you wearing the socks?
okay. But if you roll us again, this'll be the last time.
deal?
deal.
Oh, yeah!
come on!
you feel that shimmy?
it's your hind legs trying to outrun your front.
what do I do?
you stop steering and you start driving.
this ain't no dead piece of metal.
a car is a living, breathing thing, all right? She's alive.
you can feel her talking to you, telling you what she wants, what she needs. Listen.
close your eyes and listen.
they say that Ben Burns drove the final lap of the Vanderbilt cup with his eyes closed.
no way! No?
maybe you just can't hear it then. Ought to start hitting those books.
no, I hear it! Oh, is that so, Mr. Burns?
all right. Tell me when to punch it for the jump.
now? Uh-uh.
now!
local fan favorite Speed Racer is gobbling up this track.
let us hope he does not make the same mistakes that his brother made.
heads up, Speed. Seven o'clock.
I got Snake drafting Pitter-Pat.
I got him.
I figure he'll slingshot after you in the next turn.
I'm ready.
great move, Speed!
all right, watch out for the dog balls coming up.
you may wanna ease off a little.
not this time, Sparky.
holy cannoli, Speed.
you know who you're racing? Yeah.
Rex is gonna win it, ain't he, Pops?
nobody's gonna catch him. He's gonna win it.
he's gonna set the course record. Nobody's gonna stop him.
quiet. There's still a lot of race to go.
no way. It's over.
my brother's the best racer in the world.
everyone else is running for second.
Yeah!
I told you to take him out!
we're trying, sir, we're trying, but he's just too fast.
it's unbelievable, folks!
no one has seen moves like this since that remarkable night eight years ago.
there's no doubt in my mind. He's gunning for the record.
track record Rex Racer
he is not alone out there, he is chasing someone.
he is chasing the ghost of Rex Racer.
jeepers, he could do it, Pops. He could really do it.
what if he does it? What if he does it, Pops?
I don't know if I can watch this.
there's that Speed Racer.
my daddy told me that his daddy used to work for the Mishida Motorwerks...
but he quit.
my daddy told me that it was a completely crazy thing to do.
he says the whole family is crazy.
speed's not crazy.
no. He's just dumb.
probably the dumbest kid in the class.
Mrs. Waterstraat had me alphabetize the IRB tests...
and you wouldn't believe what the retard did.
speed!
speed!
are you all right?
who are you?
I'm Trixie. I'm in your class.
Oh, yeah.
Hey, you wanna see my car collection?
I'd love to.
Hey, Rex. Hey, Pops.
Hey, Speedy. Who's your friend?
her name's Trixie. She's in my class.
Hi. Pleasure to meet you, young lady.
Hey, Pops a guy told me to give this to you. Says he was a big fan.
Oh. A fan, is it?
well, it's not every day we get people with such good taste around here.
where is he?
he was in a hurry, driving a '68 Fendersin.
sweet set of wheels. Let me see that.
cool beans.
no one from these parts will ever forget the tragic story of Rex Racer.
he nearly ruined racing.
one of the bravest men to ever drive a racecar.
can I come with you, Rex?
not this time, Speedy.
when are you coming back?
I don't know. I don't know.
Hey, there's something I want you to have.
but the Mach 5's your car.
not anymore.
look, Speed...
one day, people might say things about me.
but no matter what they say...
I just...
look, I hope you never believe them.
I won't.
come here.
so you're quitting?
I have to.
no, you don't. This is a choice. You're selling out.
turning your back on everything we built here.
I'm done arguing with you, Pops.
don't you turn your back on me.
you can't tell me what to do. It's my life to live.
you walk out that door now, you better not ever come back.
Rex Racer, driving the black-and-red Uniron car...
got into a tangle with Richenbach, who was favored to win.
that was no tangle. He took Richenbach out.
well, we don't know that...
but I imagine the WRL will be reviewing this crash.
that's the third DNF crash Racer's been in.
turn it off, Speed. They ought to just suspend him.
I don't want you watching this anymore.
the trial of Rex Racer shook the world Racing League to its very foundation.
once a rat, always a rat...
and in my book, Rex Racer's nothing but a rat.
did you see that?
that will definitely leave a mark.
and Rex Racer nearly took Yokima's head off with that jump.
Hey, there is no doubt in my mind...
that Rex Racer is one of the dirtiest drivers in the world.
for five years, Rex Racer took orders from the criminal underworld.
fight! Fight! Fight!
No! You stop this! You stop it right now!
I just told him the truth!
his crumbum brother doesn't belong on a racetrack he belongs in jail!
the indictment brought down the perennial racing powerhouse, Uniron.
Uniron was linked to the notorious fixer, Blackjack Benelli.
still in prison today...
benelli was rumored to be behind the casa cristo tragedy.
this is one of the worst crashes I have ever s...
how could this happen? This is terrible.
this is just terrible.
and still no sign of driver Rex Racer.
I know.
go! Go! Go!
go! Go! Go!
"forget the past," he's saying. "This is my night!"
he's coming hard. It's gonna be close!
unbelievable! A split second late. The record still stands.
come on, let's go. Victory Lane.
folks, I knew Rex Racer and if he's up there somewhere watching this race...
you can bet your ass he's damn proud of his little brother.
pulling into victory Lane, the winner, Speed Racer!
he's going to be very good.
no, he's going to be the best...
if they don't destroy him first.
I will eat your soul your reign of terror is over berzerko no one can stop the immortal blade of berzerko by the strength of these fists and the fury of my true heart I will defeat you don't make me laugh. your kung fu is so-so
Hey, hey! What are you two doing?
nothing.
was that the same nothing that broke my last couch?
no, that was a totally different nothing.
got it!
racer residence. Morning.
may I speak to Speed Racer? He's not interested.
Spritle? What?
was that for Speed?
Yeah, but Speed doesn't wanna talk to them.
you don't know that.
sure, I do. Speed's gotta drive for Pops. He's gotta.
well, that's for Speed to decide.
now get dressed.
tell your father breakfast is ready. Ooh.
it was a virtuoso display of talent...
which has not been seen since Racer the elder...
dropped jaws eight years ago.
as we once again pull our collective jaw up from the floor we ask:
will it be different or will tragedy...?
that's enough.
I can't believe there's not one mention of Racer Motors in here.
that's because the sponsors control the media, Sparky.
good morning, everyone. Good morning.
is Speed up yet? In spirit, anyway.
Oh, thanks.
Hey, superstar. Hey, Trix.
have you seen the papers? They're all in love with you.
Really?
Yeah. There seems to be a lot of speculation about which team you'll sign with.
Really?
what the...? Earthquake! Earthquake!
quick, Pops!
the kitchen is the most dangerous place in an earthquake.
everybody, run for your life! Spritle, calm down!
Mr. Racer, morning.
what?
Oh, um, may I?
Mr. And Mrs. Racer, I hope you will forgive this imposition.
these are bluebells from Eden, Inc.
I'm told they'll bloom at least three times each time a different color.
and Mr. Racer, these are for you.
straight from the Isle of Kamut, hand-rolled, premium blend.
Thanks, but who are you?
I am E. P. Arnold Royalton, Esquire...
president and chairman of Royalton Industries.
and it is my honor to meet you both.
Oh, dear, I seem to have interrupted your breakfast.
is that pancakes I smell?
Oh, are you hungry, Mr. Royalton?
a figure like mine requires constant attention, Mrs. Racer.
and do you like pancakes?
when I was a child, we used to say:
pancakes are love.
gorgeous, Mrs Racer.
superb density. Hints of vanilla. Cinnamon?
that's right. Absolutely gorgeous.
well, I'm glad you like them.
like them? I wanna buy your recipe.
Oh! I'll give you the recipe, Mr. Royalton. Nonsense!
Cenestro Foods, a subdivision of Royalton Industries...
is planning a range of homecooked meals for travelers...
and this is just the kind of magic we're looking for.
I'll have my attorney draw up the paperwork.
now, then, we all know the reason I'm here is because of you, Speed.
I was watching last night...
and I have to tell you, young man, you gave me goose bumps.
I knew at once this was no mere driver I was watching.
this was an artist.
I imagine the phone's been ringing off the hook.
Yeah. But Speed doesn't wanna drive for you or any other sponsors.
is this your manager, then?
that's our youngest, Spritle.
nice to meet you, youngster.
we got our eye on you, mister.
excellent.
the first thing I want to make clear is that I have no intention whatsoever...
of trying to get Speed away from Racer Motors.
what you have here is what teams spend years...
and millions of dollars trying to achieve, chemistry.
I wouldn't dare touch a thing.
well, excuse me for asking, but what do you want?
to help.
I want to make sure you have access to whatever resources you need...
to continue doing exactly what you're doing.
no offense, Royalton but Racer Motors has always run as an independent.
none taken. I completely understand. I sympathize.
strike that. I empathize.
you may think of R. I. As a huge corporate conglomerate...
but I will have you know.
I still remember working all night on a commodore 64 in the basement of my foster parents' home.
I built R. I. From below the ground up.
so while Royalton Industries may look like a major sponsor to you...
it remains in my heart as independent to me...
as the first day I quit my job at GloBocom to start working for myself.
now, then...
l've had this wonderful opportunity to meet your family.
all I'm asking for is the chance to introduce you to mine.
I've never flown so low through the city.
special permit. Only six of them are granted a year.
take whatever you like.
thank you.
Spritle! What? She said we could have some.
all right, maybe one apiece.
Hey, look, that's the Grand Prix colosseum.
my brother's gonna win the Grand Prix someday.
no doubt in my mind, young man.
given the right circumstances no doubt in my mind whatsoever.
this is Gennie, our talent manager.
ask for anything. Her job is to make it come true.
Hello, Speed. Welcome to Royalton.
what's this? To make an informed decision...
you'll have to understand how we take care of our drivers.
all aboard.
Oh, cool!
Royalton Tower is the crown jewel among the properties that I control.
it functions as the corporate headquarters for the top 12 divisions of our parent corp.
one big industrious family.
our vertically integrated plant is the fastest in the world from initial carbon bond to finished car in 36 hours.
how long does it take at Racer Motors?
several weeks, at least.
this kind of production facility could be at your disposal, Mr. Racer.
hm. Yeah.
this is our operating theater...
where our patented Refusion Distributor is installed in the turbine drive.
is that an Inner-Positive Transponder?
we control the only transponder foundry in the world...
outside of Musha Motors.
Oops. Sorry, trade secret.
as you know, a T-180 driver's got to be in peak physical condition.
no expense is spared to ensure that when our drivers suit up they are as perfectly tuned as the machines they are controlling.
the best drivers must be able to withstand over four G's of force...
in a typical race.
the will to win is nothing without the will to prepare.
and at Team Royalton we prepare our drivers for any eventuality and every possible condition.
I hope I didn't scare you, Speed with how hard we push our team.
I just wanted you to see how committed we are to winning.
I get that. Good.
because I also want you to understand that R. I. Isn't all work and no play.
that's cannonball Taylor.
stop the car. Jack.
Jack, come here.
there's someone I'd like you to meet.
speed Racer.
allow me to introduce two-time Grand Prix winner...
five-time wRL champion and future hall of famer...
Jack "cannonball" Taylor.
Oh... Honor to meet you.
caught that Thunderhead replay.
nice piece of work.
Wow.
Thanks.
there was a rumor you might be visiting.
it's pretty impressive.
only thing I cared about was that wall over there.
that's what sold me.
you want to win in this league you're talking to the right guy.
Thanks, Jack.
sweet!
we treat our thoroughbreds the way they deserve to be treated.
sweet! There's a full maid service, of course...
with personal chef and masseurs available 24l7.
sweet!
thank you.
it should be perfect. Try it on.
okay.
so, Mrs. Racer...
what do you think about my family? Impressed?
you could say that. Good.
because I want you to understand the possibilities that exist for your son now.
what's wrong, Mr. Racer?
to be honest, Royalton.
I'm feeling more intimidated than impressed.
this kind of company scares me.
people like you have way too much money.
when someone gets that kind of money, they think...
that the rules everybody else plays by don't mean squat to them.
however, my sons are the most important thing I've ever done in my life...
besides marrying my best friend.
and if Speed wants us to figure out some kind of an alliance then you can bet your ass we'll be in business.
hubba-hubba.
Oh, honey, you look so handsome. Yeah?
very sharp, Speed. Suits you perfectly.
regardless of what happens, I want you to have it as a gift.
Thanks, Mr. Royalton.
so how are you feeling, Speed?
it's very...
impressive.
you think that maybe there's something that could work out here?
I guess I'd like to think about it, if I could.
this isn't the kind of offer.
I go around making every day, son.
no, I understand that, sir.
so if I had to give you an answer now, then to be honest...
stop right there.
you're right. You should think about it.
I'm sure you're feeling a bit overwhelmed.
you should take a little time...
think about what you saw and heard here and we'll get together early next week.
deal? Deal.
I thought we had a deal.
I thought we were friends.
well, maybe where you come from that's how you treat your friends.
but around here, we don't take too kindly to it, do we, fellas?
it hurts our feelings.
problem is...
I like you, Taejo.
and I've got a real soft spot in my heart...
for that sister of yours.
and normally, under circumstances such as this...
we'd be pouring you a nice...
comfortable pair of concrete shoes.
but I think I thought of another solution.
how are my babies, huh?
hungry?
ready for seconds?
boys.
No!
don't worry, it only hurts for a few seconds, then you'll probably black out.
no, please!
it'll be hard to drive with skellie hands.
no, please. You even think about turning rat...
and next time it's your sister going in there!
what? Someone's tailing us.
is it him? It could be.
Oh, God. It's him!
crush him!
he's out front.
got you.
boss! My babies.
my babies! Put your finger in there.
do it!
nice fishies, nice fishes. No, no, no.
we can't take another hit, boss!
pull over.
but don't stop.
are you hurt?
no.
then get up.
thank you. You saved my life.
I didn't save anything worth saving unless you get smart real fast.
you thought you could take on the cartel.
you can't. Not without help.
I don't know what you're talking about.
you have been on cruncher Block's leash for so long...
maybe you forgot how it feels to stand up and be a man.
the only way you'll ever stop these people is to bring them to justice.
justice?
that's a commodity I don't waste my money on.
get out.
I'll see you at Fuji. You won't finish.
when you lose, if you can still dial a phone...
call this number.
you're really considering signing with Royalton.
I just said it was tempting. Why?
well, they got a really good team.
cannonball Taylor, Maggie Manifold.
they win a lot of majors.
and since when did winning become so important?
it is important.
you gotta win if you wanna keep driving and that's what I wanna do.
it's the only thing I really know how to do.
that's not true.
come on. I wouldn't have made it out of high school without your help.
okay, well, that's true.
but when I'm in a T-180, I don't know everything just makes sense.
so are you saying this doesn't make sense?
okay, this makes sense too.
so you like this?
Yeah. This ain't so bad.
I was starting to wonder.
wonder what?
well, with you so busy becoming Mr. Super-Famous-Racecar-Driver...
I was starting to wonder if you were interested in this.
you know I am. Do I?
what, like you forgot?
maybe I need a reminder. A reminder.
sometimes a girl could use a reminder.
you mean like a new igniter for your helicopter?
well, how about a tire burn that spells out your name?
warmer.
maybe at the end of some big race when I pull into Victory Lane...
I scoop you up and kiss you with thousands of flashbulbs going off.
would that be so terrible, Mr. Super-Famous-Racecar-Driver?
I don't know.
maybe we should practice. Maybe we should.
Oh, God, I'm gonna hurl.
Spritle. He did not.
Ooh, Spritle. You little sneak.
it wasn't my idea. Oh, no?
it was his. Wait till we tell Pops.
no, don't do that. We couldn't sleep.
we just wanted to hang out.
we didn't know you were going to In-spew-ation Point.
by the way, cootie shot.
I'm taking you home.
wait. Wait. Can we stop for ice cream first?
the new GRX has a supercharged Inner-Positive Transponder...
and will be capable of speeds in excess of 800 kilometers an hour.
if such a car were to win the Grand Prix this year...
one would expect the demand for transponders to increase dramatically.
one would expect.
and if a single company gained control of all the transponder foundries in the world...
one might expect that company to do very well for itself.
you know what I want. I know for the last few years...
you've been trying to buy out your main rival, Tetsua Togokahn.
the question is, can we make a deal?
deliver Togokahn at that price and the transponder foundry is yours.
done.
speed! Mr. Royalton.
welcome!
come here. Look at this.
Wow.
that's what I thought. We're still working on the R and R but it's getting there.
come, sit. We can talk logos later.
can I get you something to drink?
water? Bubbly? A shot of rye?
no. I'm okay.
so I can see you've been giving some serious thought to this thing.
I have. Yes, sir. Good.
means you understand we're talking about not just your future...
but your family's future.
my family means a lot to me.
I know. I can tell.
that's why this is so important, because you can help them.
all you have to say is yes.
that's all I need to hear...
and I can make so many things happen for you and your family.
you ready for that?
you ready to say yes, Speed?
jackpot.
Oh, boy, oh, boy.
this isn't an easy decision for me, Mr. Royalton.
for my family, racing's everything.
I was tooling timing pins with Pops while I was still wearing diapers.
I mean there's nothing more perfect than a picnic at Thunderhead.
but when my brother died, all that went away.
I can't tell you how painful that was.
it nearly killed all of us.
especially Pops.
he didn't set foot in his shop for over a year.
one night, when I was still pretty young, I couldn't sleep and I went into the living room and there was Pops in his beat-up robe...
watching some old race recordings.
so I sat with him there...
watching old Ben Burns coming around the last turn of the 43 Prix and...
all of a sudden, Pops started screaming.
go!
and then I started screaming.
as Burns and Stickleton headed for the finish...
we were cheering our heads off.
and the second the black-and-white came down...
we looked at each other and we realized...
racing's in our blood.
but for Pops...
it isn't just a sport.
it's way more important than that.
it's like a religion.
and in our house, the major sponsors...
are kind of like the devil.
I don't mean to offend you, sir and I do appreciate your offer...
but after all we've been through...
I don't think this kind of deal's for me.
you poor, naive chump.
I'll pretend I didn't hear that sickening schmaltz...
and I'll give you an education. At the end, if you're smart you'll thank me and then you'll sign that contract.
jig's up.
holy moly.
Hey. This is Marvin, down at the landing pad.
I think we got mice again.
all right. We'll send someone over to take care of it. Over.
look. There is the true spirit of the golden age of racing.
benjamin Braddack, Reginald White, George Wheeler
diamond Dave Tewksbury...
and Oliver Potter.
the five most powerful men in the world at the turn of the last century.
for all intents and purposes they created the modern automotive industry.
but the true stroke of their genius was the invention of WRL the world's first racing league.
interesting that you and your father were so moved by the 43 Prix.
one of the great finishes in the history of racing, right?
everyone remembers Burns and Stickleton slugging it out.
but who remembers Carl Potts?
driving this rebuilt wittigan for Lodyne Industries...
Potts spun out in the second lap and went down as a DNF...
a forgettable and pathetic finish.
so bad that afterwards, Lodyne stock dropped six points.
as Ben Burns sat guzzling cold, fresh milk in Victory Lane a thousand cameras taking his picture...
Sirrus Aeronautics saw almost a 12-point gain...
which blocked Penninsula Power cell...
from being able to afford the price of a takeover.
this put Joel Goldman, the CEO of lodyne, Inc. In the exact position he wanted to be in.
by first buying controlling interest in his own company at a devalued price...
he then brokered a merger with Sirrus that sent Lodyne into the gains record book...
the only record book that matters.
look out that window.
there isn't a single plane or helicopter or K-Harrier...
that isn't powered by Lodyne fuel cells.
that's what racing is about.
it has nothing to do with cars or drivers.
all that matters is power , the unassailable might of money.
get out of the way! Out of the way! Get out of the way!
you understand?
burns knew he was going to win.
it was already decided.
a week before the Prix, Goldman and Sirrus...
met with other major players at the cargyle Hotel.
they met there as they had for years.
they met to negotiate the finish order of the Grand Prix.
no race is more important and no race is more controlled.
goldman was supposed to win, but he knew if he sold his win whatever that win might be worth was nothing compared to what could be gained.
that's why I spent $3 million on this burnt and twisted lump of metal.
because it reminds me of what really matters.
this is the true heart of racing, boy.
this is my religion.
you don't know how often I've seen that same cow-eyed...
say it isn't so look of disbelief.
every bumpkin who comes in from the sticks looks exactly as you do now.
I won't bother proving it to you.
you walk away from me and this deal you'll know how true it is soon enough.
so last chance. You ready to put away your toys and grow up?
are you ready to make more money in one year than your father made in his life?
are you ready to become a real racecar driver?
then sign that contract!
spearhook.
what's this?
if that's your idea of racing, you can keep it.
listen to me and listen good, kid because I'm gonna give you one more history lesson.
you're gonna go to Fuji and try and prove everything I told you is nothing but a lie.
but no matter how well you drive you won't win, you won't place.
I guarantee you right now, you won't even finish the race.
speed Racer's making his move, gunning for the lead.
the Harbinger of Boom once again leaves his mark...
a trail of carnage and chaos cartwheeling behind him!
Oh, but the fans love it, don't they?
they do, God help them.
they're about to get more as Lodyne is now slugging it out with young Taejo Togokahn.
Oh, terrible crash!
they'll have to fish Taejo and Billy Ray out of the drink.
but this race is far from over.
right now, one car stands between Speed Racer and the lead.
the Grey Ghost. We got ourselves a real race here!
show me what you got. Show me what you got!
speed, get out of there! I can't. I can't move!
soon after that there will be litigation against some of your father's designs.
are you Pops Racer of Racer Motors?
Yeah, but I'm still on vacation.
you are hereby served a summons.
what? You are being sued for IP infringement...
by Janus Automakers.
no way! That's ridiculous.
that's for a jury to decide.
the legitimacy of the lawsuits won't matter.
they'll be enough to discredit his company.
whatever contracts he has, he'll lose.
within a year, he'll be filing for bankruptcy.
after that you and the rest of your pathetic family will be history.
pops is right.
you are the devil.
Mr. Royalton. What?!
speed! Spritle?
I found these two sneaking around a restricted area.
get this Racer trash out of my building.
I'll see you in Fuji. Yes.
and then you'll find out you just made the biggest mistake of your life!
Hey, kid.
Ben Burns? Nice race.
I ain't seen moves like that in a long time.
it didn't matter, I still lost.
Yeah. Tough break.
well, good luck.
Mr. Burns, can I ask you something?
sure, kid.
the 43 Prix.
did you know you were gonna win?
you know, everybody thought that me and Stickleton hated each other.
funny, ain't it?
controversy surrounds Racer Motors now embroiled in IP litigation.
and while evidence remains inconclusive...
whether or not Speed used an illegal device...
the Fuji-Helexicon seems destined to become another mark of shame...
added to the notorious Racer family legacy...
a legacy that has forever tainted the integrity of this...
Sparky.
sorry, ma'am.
I'm gonna send that guy some chim chim cookies.
you'll do no such thing. We gotta do something, Pops.
this is exactly what he said would happen if I didn't drive for him.
he's just trying to scare you.
they tried the same thing with Rex.
it's a fight they want, it's a fight they'll get.
how? What can we do? How can we fight this?
the truth'll come out.
the truth?
don't be naive, Pops.
speed?
are you all right?
I don't know.
it's gonna be okay. We'll work this out.
I don't know, Mom. I may have really messed things up.
how?
by not joining Royalton.
Oh, don't be silly.
you never would have been happy racing for that terrible man.
maybe that's not the point.
maybe Royalton's right and racing's all about business...
and anyone who doesn't understand that is just a chump.
now you listen to me, young man.
what you do behind the wheel of a racecar has nothing to do with business.
before you could even talk you were making noises that sounded like an engine.
we tried to take you to the park and you never wanted to get out of the car.
I loved that old wagon.
and you remember when Rex took you out to Thunderhead and let you drive?
and I turned it over.
Oh, my heart starts pounding just thinking about it.
mom! Yeah, you should've seen it! Yeah!
Rex told me the only reason we survived was because I was wearing red socks.
I thought your father would have a heart attack...
when you came in with that crazy smile.
speed, when I watch you do some of the things you do...
I feel like I'm watching someone paint or make music.
I go to the races to watch you make art.
and it's beautiful...
and inspiring...
and everything that art should be.
even though there are times when I have to close my eyes.
but then there are other times...
when you just take my breath away.
it's at those moments when I feel your father's chest swell and I know that he's smiling...
because he's pretending that he doesn't have tears in eyes that I just go to pieces.
Why?
because I am so impossibly proud to be your mom.
it's gonna be okay, honey. You'll see. We'll work this out.
we have to stick together and something good will happen.
you'll see.
racer X! The Harbinger of Boom!
run for your lives!
what are you two squawking about?
pops, whatever you do, don't open that door.
this is a bad idea.
if it was any other driver, you'd be here.
inspector Detector.
good morning, Mr. Racer. I know it's been a long time.
ten years.
we've been after Royalton for years for dozens of capital corporate crimes...
...Including wRL fixing but we haven't had the evidence we needed to convict him...
...until now.
what's he doing here?
racer X works closely with our wRL corporate crimes Division ...helping us recruit drivers like you, Speed.
why does he always wear that mask?
if any of you knew his identity you'd become targets for his enemies...
which include some of the most vicious fixers in the world.
what do you want with me?
are you familiar with the driver Taejo Togokahn?
of course. For years...
...he's been contracted by a fixer named cruncher Block.
recently, Taejo's been forced to lose races and he began resisting...
...Thinking that he could do it on his own.
after Fuji, he realized he needed help. Why help him?
because he has a file with enough information to connect Block to Royalton...
...which could put both of them behind bars for the rest of their lives.
the problem is, he won't give us the file...
unless we help him stop the takeover of his family's company.
how?
there's an upcoming race that Taejo believes if he can win ...it'll catapult Togokahn Motors into the spotlight...
...Double the cost of the buyout, which should kill it.
there aren't any more races left except the Grand Prix...
...and we both failed to qualify.
Ahem. There aren't any more track races.
this is a cross-country rally.
casa cristo.
what?
I know it seems cruel of me to ask.
Taejo made it clear he had to have Speed and X on his team ...or there would be no deal. Absolutely not.
you'll have the support of the entire C. I.B. No.
rally racing is a back-alley sport filled with jackals headhunters and thugs.
I'm sorry, but I've already lost one son to that deathtrap.
I won't lose another.
I understand.
if you change your mind...
keep your card, chief Inspector.
thank you for your time.
but Pops'll never let you go.
he won't if I ask him.
speed Racer, what are you thinking?
you weren't in Royalton's office, Trix.
you don't know what it was like.
it felt as though he had his hand inside my chest...
...and he was trying to crush everything in my life that mattered to me.
all right. Let's do it.
you're gonna need an alibi. We'll say we're going skiing.
what? No way.
you're gonna need my help.
casa cristo is a rally. I can spot from a copter.
Trixie, this isn't a game. These people play rough.
I know. That's why I'm going with you.
if you even try to argue with me.
I'll tell Pops and he'll never let you out of his sight.
you would, wouldn't you?
well...
...I guess we're going skiing.
we're just minutes away from the start of the 82nd annual Casa Cristo Classic...
...the grande dame of cross-country, the second-oldest rally race in the world...
...Spanning two continents, three climate changes...
...and 5, 000 kilometers of the most winding and treacherous roads ever raced.
with me again is five-time Casa Cristo champion...
Spritle. ..Johnny "Goodboy" Jones.
what are you two doing?
just watching a little TV, Pops.
it's his favorite show.
it's in German. Not the monkey parts.
Oh, no, you don't. You are not watching that race.
out you go. Outside. Get some exercise.
you're too pale.
speed.
I want you to understand how much the C. I.B. appreciates your help on this.
I'm not doing this to help the C. I.B.
I don't know anything about corporate crimes and if I did, it wouldn't really matter.
I'm doing this because someone's trying to hurt my family...
...and I'm gonna do everything I can to hurt him back.
safety has been a primary concern for casa cristo officials especially the last few years.
that's right. There were a number of fatalities years ago.
it really had a bad reputation.
fans started calling it "The Crucible."
these are some of the most dangerous drivers in the world.
and we expect they'll do anything they can to stop you.
their cars will probably be equipped with secret weapons...
so we've modified the Mach 5 to try to counter their attacks.
the A button will operate your normal jump-jacks.
b will seal your cockpit which we fortified with bulletproof polymer.
should someone go after your tires with say, a hidden shank or shredder...
...the c button will activate your tire shields.
however, in the event of any blowout...
...D will inflate a Hexadyno emergency spare.
e will activate these zircon-tipped saw blades.
they'll cut through almost anything. Use with discretion.
F will project the tire crampons.
finally, G will launch a remote-control homing bird...
that is capable of transmitting U-cAP footage where you are.
every race fan has heard the rumors...
...of spearhooks, tire shanks, battery boosters.
Oh, no. While it's true there have been a few bad apples...
...on the whole, most teams stay within league rules.
or at least try not to get caught.
this is wrong, what you are trying to do.
Musha's price is an insult to five generations of our family.
and if you die?
then will the price be high enough?
I have no choice. Why?
he is your father too.
I finally understand it now, Trix.
I know why he left us.
he was trying to change this rotten business and they killed him for it.
a lot of drivers believe that the hardest part of Cristo is the start.
the Muqranna? Yeah, those archways are tricky.
and speaking of starts here comes the queen of Casa Cristo now.
the moment the queen sees the sun, she'll signal the start.
no, no, no. This is supposed to be my race.
I'm supposed to win.
I got the green light.
they promised I would go to the Grand Prix.
for eight years, I played by the rules!
this is supposed to be my race! Enough!
I can't stand the whining.
like a baby needing its diaper changed.
it's simple.
we have a team of wild cards.
the problem is, these wild cards are better drivers than you.
what? Like hell they are!
prove it.
take out Taejo and the other two will quit.
you just watch me.
come on!
I got Racer.
this team Taejo Togokahn's put together looks like they mean business.
as they head out of the city and into the Zunubian Desert...
...the team leading the pack is Snake oiler!
let's pinch these turds off.
come on! We are falling behind!
speed! On your right, Flying Foxes!
got them.
headhunters.
they're not alone.
Oh, no. Speed Racer has a blowout!
move it, Speed. It's getting ugly out there.
okay, no more Mr. Nice-Guy.
hurry, Speed, they need you!
where have you been?
have any of these drivers read the rulebook?
see? This race is full of cheaters.
it's tough to see what goes on in those dust clouds.
it can get really nasty in there.
watch the backdraft.
you want some? Come on! Thor-Azine, yeah!
wing left.
flying in.
lead them. Here you go.
Ha-ha!
watch the blind side!
broom Hilda!
Crom!
Taejo!
Oh, my God, did I just see that?
a rear single-set jump into a flying kick.
I know he blew up at Fuji, but this kid is flat-out magic.
I'm going into town for some parts. I'll be back for lunch.
sure thing, Pops.
let's go!
the Togokahn Team is fighting their way...Game on.
...Back into the race behind the electrifying driving of Speed Racer.
the fans are getting their money's worth.
honey, I can't find my wallet.
Spritle!
you two are in big trouble. Wait.
wait, before you get mad at us, look!
I'm not falling for that.
it's Speed! Speed's skiing!
then who's driving the Mach 5?
relentless as the eight remaining teams...
...Slice their way through the aqueducts of Sassicaia.
Oh, no.
as we near the end of the first leg of the casa cristo one team has dominated.
and here they come through the streets of cortega heading for the finish.
Yeah!
if we drive tomorrow like we drove today, we will lose!
you will get nothing.
all of this will be meaningless!
relax. Snake's weak on turns.
we'll catch him in the mountains.
we might, if you stop showing off.
Hey, all I was doing was saving your ass.
don't fall apart yet.
there's still a lot of race to run.
a C. I.B. Man will be posted outside your door.
we got their attention today.
you and Trixie should be very careful tonight.
racer X.
I thought we made a good team today.
it felt like we've been doing it for a long time.
if you say so.
ineptitude. Is this what I pay you for?!
they ain't checkered yet.
if they do I assure you it'll be a very costly mistake for everyone.
it was very weird, Trix.
I knew every move he was gonna make and he knew mine.
it was so familiar.
maybe I'm crazy but Racer X first showed up two years after Rex's death.
but, Speed, we buried Rex.
a body was buried. Remember it had already been badly burned in the crash.
even if it was Rex, no one could have recognized him.
so you think he faked the crash with a different body in the driver's seat?
somehow the kwik-save was disconnected.
inspector Detector suspected foul play but nothing could be proved.
do you really think Rex could put everyone through all that?
maybe he felt he didn't have any other choice.
I'm sorry to disturb you, sir, but do you know these people?
Yeah.
is this the kind of driver I have?
someone who disobeys? Someone who lies to me?
is this the kind of son I've raised?
and you, Trixie.
you know what this race did to this family.
did either of you stop and think about us?
that's all I've been thinking about, Pops.
you, Mom, Spritle, Sparky.
Yeah, you too, chim chim.
we're in serious trouble, Pops, and it's all my fault.
this is not the place or race to do anything about that.
why not? Because it won't do any good.
you don't know that.
you think you can drive a car and change the world?
it doesn't work like that.
maybe not.
but it's the only thing I know how to do and I gotta do something.
that's unacceptable. This is over.
pack your things. We're going home.
I can't.
I'm sorry, Pops.
what?
I'm staying. So am I.
no, you're not. We're going home right now!
I'm not a child, Pops.
you can't tell me how to live my life.
if you wanna fire me as your driver, then, fine, do it.
but it won't change the fact that I am going to finish this race.
God, you sound like Rex! You wanna die like him too?
will that make you happy?
don't take it out on me because you feel guilty for Rex!
okay, you two, that's enough.
pops. If they're staying, we're staying.
woo-hoo! Room service!
and I suggest that we all find a way to go home together.
Where's the Mach 5? Logged with security.
you added something to it, didn't you?
some defensive modifications.
whole thing's out of balance, isn't it?
it pulls left, rides a little stiff.
Mmm. Sparky! Huh?
I'm sorry, Mom.
your father loves you. It's just...
I know.
it's gonna be okay.
you wouldn't lie to your mother, would you?
never again.
I got him, Speed! I got him! I got him!
still got him!
speed!
attack!
what's going on out there?
you attack my family.
you try to hurt my sons.
here we go!
what's going...?
Oh, my God. Was that a ninja?
more like a non-ja.
terrible what passes for a ninja these days.
cool beans.
Oh, I'm sorry. I was looking for Speed Racer.
Horuko. Are you all right?
no. Something terrible has happened.
Narcolyte benzamine.
a highly effective and debilitating drug.
stays in the system for hours, but leaves with no trace.
I'll be fine by morning.
no, you won't. You can't drive a car You can barely stand up
you do not tell me what I can do.
Taejo.
what are we gonna do?
the second leg of the Casa Cristo is under way...
...and the stage is set for what might be...
...one of the most ferocious rallies we've seen in years.
this is my race.
she's leaving the hotel now.
wicked sidewinder coming up.
watch the inside-out, could get dicey.
watch your line!
watch it!
this is abso...
lutely crazy.
Yeah, boss. Signal's loud and clear.
don't do it! On the ground! Now!
gotcha.
what the...?
you cheater!
if you're here, who's?
that's better. I couldn't see a thing.
that's it. Nice line, Trix.
top of the hill's coming up.
snake's got about a quarter of a mile on you.
all right. Let's get him.
if you'd been more careful, he wouldn't be ahead.
I told you, I couldn't see a thing out of this dang helmet.
I can't believe you talked us into this ridiculous idea.
what's ridiculous about it?
you're always saying I'm a better driver than most of wRL.
now's not the time to prove it. Why not?
it's too dangerous.
it's too dangerous for me, but not for you?
children, focus.
if we're going to have a chance we'll have to pass Snake before the rendezvous.
I'm ready. Let's roll.
woo-hoo! Go get them, girl!
here they come. Let's pick it up!
take him. With pleasure.
bring it on!
come on!
now the gloves are off and they're pounding one another bumper to bumper, rail to rail.
take that, Togokahn!
you're going down!
Oh, yeah! That's my boy!
Oh, God. Speed.
please! Please! Please!
Oh, please! Please! Aah!
the Togokahn Team roars into the lead...
...behind some very aggressive driving by Speed Racer.
you kidding? He just tore Snake a new tailpipe.
Trix, you all right?
Ten-four. Ready for more.
then let's move it. We've got some time to eat up.
you're sure, no cameras here?
no, I checked it this morning.
there's quite a few dead spots in these mountains.
what's he doing here?
stowaway. We weren't sure what to do with him.
do what he'd do. Break his legs and let him walk back.
thank you so much. It was a blast.
the cell's reloaded. Let's go!
good luck.
nobody move.
waiting for the Togokahn Team to come out of the pass.
those roads can really ice up. Very dangerous.
what is this? This...
...is called a change of plan.
Yeah, that's right.
we're changing your plan that changed our plan to change your plan.
right, boss?
the new plan, what was it?
"break your legs and make you walk back." I like that.
but first, it's time to play a little game of peekaboo...
Ow! Monkey cookie!
nice shot! Spritle?
get that monkey!
nobody messes with Spark...
looks like another change of plan.
take him away, boys.
Spritle!
go! Go, go!
no.
Oh, no, you don't. You're in big trouble.
first out of the pass is...
...the Hydra-cell Team.
Uh-oh. They better send the emergency trailer.
wait, is that...?
here we go again.
whatever happened in that pass left Togokahn where they started ...but now only one obstacle stands between Snake oiler and victory.
the Maltese Ice caves.
this is where Rex cr...
speed, what are you doing?
are you all right? I'm fine.
this next cave's a rattler. We'll make our move in there.
now.
Ah, not this time, punk.
speed!
Bye-bye, little turd. Ha-ha-ha!
he did not! He did not just do that!
speed Racer is driving straight up a cliff face.
are we getting this?
come on! Go, Speed, go!
Hi. Remember me? No way.
no, no, no! Not again! Not again!
gun!
snake Oiler completely going out of his mind!
could have been altitude sickness. It gets crazy.
speed handled it beautifully.
and with less than 250 kilometers to go...
...nothing seems to stand between Togokahn and victory.
get me touch Tetsua Togokahn.
thank you.
we make a good team.
we did our part. Make sure you do yours.
of course.
congratulations, Mr. Togokahn.
very impressive race. Yes, thank you.
you're very generous, Mr. Royalton.
here's Speed. Does this mean you've signed with Togokahn?
uh, no, this was a mutually beneficial opportunity.
Yes. Well put.
Taejo, will you be running in the Grand Prix this weekend?
we'll see. Right now I'm just going to enjoy this victory.
the price is 78 a share.
that's outrageous.
the price is barely above 50. This is extortion, blackmail.
I'll sue you, tie up every asset you own for next 20 years.
as you wish, Mr. Royalton. Have a nice day...
wait.
seventy-eight a share.
I'll have the paperwork drawn up.
a pleasure doing business with you.
you have done very well for us, my son.
I don't get it. What just happened?
Togokahn played us for chumps.
he wanted our help to drive up the stock in family business.
even if he had a file, he wouldn't turn it over.
you mean the whole race was for nothing?
racer X.
racer X!
Jesus, kid, you can drive.
I haven't been thrown like that in years.
what are you doing here?
the inspector told me what happened. I came looking for you.
why would you care?
because you're a fighter and a friend.
why don't you just tell me the truth?
you're Rex, aren't you? You mean your brother?
you first appeared two years after Rex died.
you drive just like him.
you knew I'd be here because this is where he always used to take me.
just tell me the truth.
you're not Rex.
no, Speed.
I'm sorry, but your brother is dead.
I'm sorry. Don't be.
I'm sure if he was here, he'd be immensely proud of you.
for what?
making the same mistakes he did?
for trying to make a difference.
from what I've read, that's all he tried to do.
and what good did it do? He got killed for nothing.
racing hasn't changed and it never will.
it doesn't matter if racing never changes.
what matters is if we let racing change us.
everyone has to find a reason to do this.
you don't climb into a T-180 to be a driver.
you do it because you're driven.
if you know so much why don't you tell me why I should keep driving?
sorry.
that's for you to figure out.
I just hope when you do...
...that I'm there to see it.
what you doing? What's it look like?
where you going?
I don't know. I just gotta get away from here.
can I come with you, Rex? What?
can we come with you?
no. Why not?
you'll understand when it's your turn.
speed.
before you go, I'd like to say a few things.
will you sit with your old man for a minute?
don't try to stop me. I won't.
speed, I want you to know I acted rashly.
I said things I wish I hadn't.
your mother usually protects me from making an ass out of myself...
...but I was determined to do it this time and I guess I did a pretty good job of it.
I just wanted to make sure you understood how sorry I was.
Thanks.
the truth was I couldn't have been more proud of you, son.
not because you won but because you stood up, you weren't afraid...
...and you did what you thought was right.
it didn't amount to anything. It was completely meaningless.
how could it be meaningless?
I saw my son become a man.
I watched him act with courage and integrity...
...and drive the pants off every other driver on that road.
this is not meaningless This is a reason for a father's life
I went to cortega because I was afraid what happened to Rex ...was gonna happen to you, and I just couldn't take that.
but what I realized at cortega...
...was I didn't lose Rex when he crashed. I lost him here.
I let him think that a stupid motor company meant more to me than he did.
he'll never know how much I regret that mistake.
it's enough I'll never make it again.
speed, I understand that every child has to leave home...
...but I want you to know, that door is always open.
you can always come back.
because I love you.
I love you, Pops.
I'm just so confused right now.
I feel like I'm caught in some kind of a tailspin and no direction makes sense.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
when Rex died, I didn't know if I wanted salt on my eggs let alone keep building cars.
but then... You remember that night...
we sat together, we watched old Ben Burns and Stickleton?
you remember that?
that night, something just clicked.
like a light being switched on inside of me.
after that
I never had trouble remembering how I liked my eggs.
jeez, Pops, that's just it. That's part of my problem.
what? That race...
...the 43 Prix.
burns and Stickleton? It was fixed.
Royalton told me the whole story.
it was all about some DNF named Potts.
they've known the winner of every Grand Prix for the past 50 years. It's always fixed.
I don't believe that. Royalton's a crook.
you can't believe a crook.
I don't think he was lying, Pops.
the Grand Prix, a sham?
Horuko. Forgive me for intruding...
...but I had to come before it was too late.
this is not a trick.
I swear to you. I'm not my brother.
you gonna ask the lovely lady in?
Yeah, sure. Come on in.
can I get you something to drink? No.
my security man believes I'm still at the opera...
...so I only have a moment.
I'm very sorry for what happened.
what my father and brother did was not right and I'm ashamed
it's fine. Just another lesson learned.
no. It is they who are in need of a lesson.
this rightfully belongs to you.
an invitation to compete in the 91 st annual Grand Prix.
my brother was planning to decline anyway.
but I studied the rules very carefully.
and as a member of the winning Togokahn Team...
...if you present this invitation on the day of the race they must allow you to compete.
ha! What do you think of that, Mr. It's-Always-Fixed?
I...you don't have to say anything.
I only hope you drive as you did in casa cristo...
...and you wipe the smiles from their faces.
we don't have a car.
Sparky! No. No. He'll yell at me!
right here, Pops. What are you doing in the kitchen?
same as everyone else.
I don't believe it. You were listening the whole time?
and I'm so glad I did. We were so worried about you.
Horuko.
thank you.
I would say, "Good luck Saturday," but you don't need it.
you're already very lucky to have such a family.
come on, we got work to do.
the race is less than two days away.
how fast did Royalton say he could build that tin can with his machines?
thirty-six hours.
then we'll do it in 32. come on, let's go.
cameraman.
ladies and gentlemen, behold the future!
Sparky? You ready?
ready, Pops.
pops, that's a Bernoulli convergenator.
transponder schmonder. You want real kick, you go Bernoulli.
were you here last year?
Yes, you were. No.
the colosseum has begun to fill final preparations are under way.
we're expecting the largest television audience in Grand Prix history.
we've got an incredible lineup this year like the Grey Ghost ...Sonic "Boom-boom" Renaldi Nitro venderhoss and The Scarlet valentine.
not to mention c-Ball.
cannonball Taylor, fastest Grand Prix seed in history...
...driving the new GRx from Royalton Race Cars.
Thanks, doll. You're welcome.
we've got an odd-numbered field this year one shy of a full boat...
...as Taejo Togokahn declined his automatic invitation after winning the Casa Cristo.
all right, let's start her up.
sounds beefy, Pops.
Yeah, I gave it a little something extra.
come on, let's load it up.
hold on. Something's going on over there.
we're seeing some kind of commotion down at the trailer entrance.
excuse me.
is there a problem here, officer?
why, you sly dog.
sir, we have a problem.
excuse me.
what madness is going on here?
Mr. Royalton, this is a legitimate invitation.
we have verified it.
where did you get this? I won it fair and square.
this is preposterous. He can't be allowed to race.
it's too late.
the ruling on this is clear. Try to stop it...
...and you'll be in blatant violation of the wRL charter...
...leaving me no option but to shut this year's Prix down...
...until a full investigation can be completed.
what? Have you any idea what that would cost? Are you insane
try me.
something big is going on because every race official has...
wait, wait, an announcement is being made.
now driving in the 40th and final position...
holy sh !
...for Racer Motors in the Mach 6, Speed Racer.
a million dollars to the driver that takes out Racer.
he won't even get out of the blocks.
I'd prefer him to not even make it out of the locker room.
we're installing a spearhook in the GRX.
I don't need one to beat that punk.
a precaution.
as the cars take to the field...
...you can feel the anticipation mounting in the audience.
something is different.
there's an electricity in the air.
the presence of Speed Racer...
...has completely changed the equation.
how are you feeling?
it's big.
that cockpit is the exact same size it was at Thunderhead.
right.
I wanna say thank you...
for what could be the most exciting moment in my whole life.
couldn't have gotten here without you.
I'm looking forward to that cold milk. Me too.
ladies and gentlemen, start your engines!
the final countdown has begun...
...and a stillness has fallen over this stadium...
...as all eyes turn to one car.
this ain't a race, this is a showdown.
trouble at the start. A misfire traps Speed Racer causing a collision.
Uh-oh. Look out.
Ooh, that kid is wily!
I don't know how he got out of that one.
nice, nice.
speed Racer blows by Katsu Toppledama charging into the Moguls.
he's taking on all comers.
Kelly Kellencoff makes a move, cuts him off!
Ah, big mistake! Speed fakes left, jumps right.
he slips in behind Gearbox.
here comes over-under.
I told you! I told you!
speed Racer seems unstoppable moving up from dead last, nearing the leaders.
go, Speed, go!
but look out. As they approach the Big Drop here comes Speed Racer.
speed Racer is knocking on the door of cannonball Taylor.
Yoo-hoo, anybody home?
OK Mr. Two-Time-Grand-Prix-Five-Time-wRL-Future-Hall-of-Fame ...teach me something.
you ready?
Ha-ha. Let's go.
get that weak shit off my track.
come on, that move is weak.
cannonball Taylor's in trouble.
tear him up, kid, tear him up.
come on, is that all you got?
lesson's over. See you at the finish line.
do it. Stop him. Stop him now.
Oh, no. What is it?
spearhook! He's got me.
cannonball has Speed pinned as they grind through the butterfly turn.
that cheater. He's using a spearhook!
cannonball clearly using a spearhook.
that could cost him the hall of fame.
not to mention what it'll do to Royalton Industries.
shame on them.
Oh, no, no, no, don't do this!
the Triple Phase conductor's fried.
Sparky, get me back in this race.
what's wrong?
the crash must've dislodged the conductor.
starter's overloaded.
the nickelhydrate cells are hemorrhaging.
what do I do?
don't panic.
just listen, Speed. Just listen to her.
if I could defibrillate the...
Shh. Sparky. Give me a second.
is there anything he can do?
I ran a patch through the starter to the convergenator.
if he puts the car in fifth gear, he could jump-start it.
will he know that?
would Sparky?
what do you need?
he's back in it!
come on, kid, move it!
he's gonna do it.
I don't know why I'm doing it anymore.
you don't climb into a T-180 to be a driver.
you do it because you're driven.
racing has nothing to do with cars or drivers.
you ready to put away your toys and grow up?
are you ready to become a real racecar driver?
look at the split. He's shattering the lap record.
if you know so much, tell me why I should keep driving.
that's for you to figure out.
I just hope when you do...
...that I'm there to see it.
when I watch you do some of the things you do...
...when you just take my breath away.
you remember that night?
we sat together, we watched old Ben Burns and Stickleton.
that night, something just...
...clicked.
racing hasn't changed and it never will.
it doesn't matter if racing never changes. What matters...
...is if we let racing change us.
when I'm in a T- 180
I don't know, everything just makes sense.
no hesitation. Nothing fazes him.
no one seems capable of stopping him.
he's on a mission.
with a quarter-lap to go, Speed Racer is back.
two cars between him and destiny.
stop him!
here we go again.
Yes!
speed Racer!
it's pandemonium. People here have gone completely crazy.
in 14 years, we've never seen anything like this.
it's a whole new world, baby. It's a whole new world.
he did it.
Yes, he did. This could change everything.
it already has.
my men are bringing family down. Do you wanna go with them?
no.
can I ask you a question?
did you ever think you made a mistake hiding the truth from them?
if I did...
...It's a mistake I have to live with.
speed!
speed!
thank you, Speed. I love you, sweetie.
that was so beautiful.
I'm proud of you, son.

...what has turned into a classic Formula 1 season.
...with the weather conditions so uncertain, the drivers prepare for...
...the track is still dangerously wet, but following a drivers meeting, a decision has been taken.
three minutes to go. Everybody off the grid now.
25 drivers start every season in Formula 1, and each year, two of us die.
what kind of person does a job like this?
not normal men, for sure.
rebels, lunatics, dreamers.
people who are desperate to make a Mark and are prepared to die trying.
my name is Niki Lauda, and racing people know me for two things.
the first is my rivalry with him.
what about Hunt? Has he changed?
no, he's going on wets.
I don't know why it became such a big thing.
we were just drivers busting each other's balls.
to me this is perfectly normal, but other people saw it differently, that whatever it was between us went deeper.
the other thing I'm remembered for is what happened on 1st August 1976, when I was chasing him like an asshole.
Yeah, that's the one. On the second shelf. Thank you.
trauma trolley, please.
I think the racetrack telephoned ahead that I was coming.
hunt. James Hunt.
what's the matter? No one ever seen a spot of blood before?
are you all right? - Absolutely fine.
we all thought you'd been in an accident.
I have.
if you call a friendly disagreement with another driver an accident.
what did you disagree about?
it's none of your business.
sorry.
his wife.
that's going to need a couple of stitches.
it's a nasty cut. - It was a nasty blow.
done with a bloody crowbar.
Why? What did you do? - Nothing.
only what she asked me to do.
which was...?
I'd be happy to show you if you like.
sorry.
I have a theory why women like racing drivers.
it's not because they respect what we do, driving round and round in circles.
mostly they think that's pathetic and they're probably right.
it's our closeness to death.
the closer you are to death, the more alive you feel.
the more alive you are. And they can see that in you.
they feel that in you.
my name is James Hunt.
my father is a stockbroker, my sister is a barrister and my brother is an accountant.
and I, well, I do this.
it's a wonderful way to live. It's the only way to drive.
as if each day is your last.
I've never been to a Grand Prix before.
you still haven't.
this is Formula 3. - What's that?
that's a lower division, where idiots like me mess about in the hop of being talent-spotted to race in F1.
you look disappointed. - No.
you only slept with me because you thought I was famous.
that's not true!
don't worry. I will be one day.
morning, everyone.
this is Nursie. - Gemma.
Nursie, this is Bubbles Horsely, team manager.
how do you do?
bubbles? - Yeah.
doc Postlethwaite, our designer.
how do you do?
and Alexander, Lord Hesketh, the team's owner.
how do you do?
fine, thanks.
well done, Superstar!
that's the car? - Yep, that's her.
lotus 59.
1000cc. Cosworth Mae engine.
she's no beauty, but goes like the slappers.
nothing to be worried about. Does it before every race.
good sign, actually. Means he's stoked.
all Formula 3 cars to the assembly area.
now, please.
...Drivers please bring them to the scrutineering bay now.
all right, Superstar?
never better, patron.
have a gargle with this. - Thank you.
quick toke of this.
at Crystal Palace today, James Hunt's on pole, with Austrian newcomer Niki Lauda alongside him and Dave Walker completing Row 1.
row 2 is Mike Beuttler and Dave Morgan, with Tony Trimmer and Gerry Birrell.
who's that?
he's new.
some German. - Austrian.
he's been here since 5 a. m. walking the track.
you might actually have to concentrate today, James.
you'll need these.
okay, start her up.
Ah! What music!
they could never have imagined it, those pioneers who invented the automobile, that it would possess us like this, in our imaginations, our dreams.
Nursie, men love women, but even more than that, men love cars!
come on, James! - It's James! Go on, James!
go, James!
hunt's still in the lead, but Niki Lauda is right on his tail!
hunt and Lauda are proving to be in a class of their own.
they're leaving the pack far behind.
Herr Red Devil's on his tail.
Lauda takes a look down the inside...
...and he's sold him a dummy!
Lauda is through! He's in the lead!
hunt will be determined to make up for that mistake.
hunt's in Lauda's slipstream.
Lauda's not leaving any gap.
the Lotus goes for the inside.
it's an aggressive move from Hunt.
there's contact!
the leaders have spun out! Lauda's facing the wrong way!
the back marker's gone through!
you can see why Hunter's fellow drivers call him.
hunt the Shunt.
asshole!
go on, James! - The Kraut's out of it!
Lauda is clearly furious.
there's every reason to expect sharp words in the pit.
it's going to be victory for Hunt.
it's going to be an ignominious defeat for Niki Lauda.
so James Hunt scores his third major Formula 3 win of the season here, at Crystal Palace, after a desperate battle with Niki Lauda.
Lauda was unable so restart after Hunt's aggressive move caused them both to spin out in the last lap of the race.
hard luck. Better luck next time.
Hey, asshole!
that was my line. I had that corner.
you mean the one that you spun out of and finished facing the other way?
I think that corner had you.
that move was total suicide. What if I hadn't braked?
we'd have crashed. - But we didn't, did we?
thanks to your impeccable survival instincts.
fuck you! What's your name?
James Simon Wallis Hunt.
remember it, my little Jerry friend.
Jawohl! Remember ze name. - It's very simple.
hunt, it rhymes with cunt!
a word that happens to describe you perfectly.
who was that?
I've no idea. He looks like a rat, doesn't he?
in my hometown, Vienna, my family's famous for one thing:
business.
my grandfather was a businessman, my father, too.
so when they heard I wanted to race cars for a living,
they are a few things to say.
good.
so if my family wasn't going to help me,
I decided to risk everything and take out a Loan myself.
I found a Formula 1 team with an Ok car and an owner who had run out of money and was willing to accept my terms.
and so, ladies and gentlemen,
I'm delighted to say...
that the winner of the Guild of Motoring Writers Award.
driver of the Year...
is James Hunt.
superb news!
well done, James. - Superstar!
fantastic!
well done. - Thank you so much.
Yes!
my parents always wanted me to be a doctor or a stockbroker or something. They gave me the first-class education, but that went all terribly wrong and I ended up with you lot.
thank you. I need it more than you do.
I mean, I have a hot head, an inability to tolerate discipline...
Yes! - Very true!
I fall out with people left and right.
the only creatures I've ever really loved or treated honorably are budgerigars.
so in any normal area of life, I'd be, or I am, a total liability.
the only thing I've got going for me is I'm quick in a car.
so thank you for this and for acknowledging that.
I'm going to give it to my father and tell him to put it on the mantelpiece and imagine it's a first-class degree in medicine.
well done, Superstar.
another season like that,
I'll move you up to the big time.
come on, you don't think I'm ready now?
you are.
I'm not. I've got to find you a car first.
well, go on, then.
chop chop. Don't wait too long.
you don't want him to do what Lauda just did.
Why? What did he do? - Got himself a drive, with BRM.
how the hell did he do that? He's a nobody.
he's never won a bloody thing.
apparently, took out a Loan and bought his way in with two million Austrian shillings.
Jesus.
Niki Lauda.
here for pre-season testing. BRM?
sign the release form. I'll let them know you're here.
Mr. Stanley. - Good morning.
good morning. - Clay!
let me introduce you to our number one driver.
clay Regazzoni.
how are you? - Good.
pleasure.
and these are your mechanics.
they're reporting exclusively to you, as per contract.
pleasure.
do you wanna see the car? - Sure.
hello.
there she is. P160.
same as Regazzoni's? - Identical in every detail.
how much does she weigh?
600 kilos. - But that's crazy.
why so heavy? - It's a V12 engine.
that lump weighs 190K on its own.
okay.
what horsepower are you getting?
no, no, 450. - It's not enough.
it needs to be 500.
and the engine needs to be.
we already tried. - Tried what?
everything.
we replaced the entire exhaust system.
barely made the difference. - Are you using magnesium parts?
now the engine block.
any mounting or fixing plates, strip it out also.
when you've done that, we have to look at the aerodynamics, front and rear wing.
okay, thank you. Good night.
what was Regazzoni's time?
0. 00130787037037037.
okay, now put him in my car and he'll go 2 seconds faster.
well, that's impossible. - No chance.
we've been working on it all night.
put Regazzoni in the car. See what happens.
I don't understand. Why am I supposed to do this?
I don't know, Clay.
he wants you to take it for a spin.
gloves, please.
I'd say we push it... - All right.
what did you do to the car?
that's information I'll share with you under certain conditions only.
go on.
a guaranteed place in the team.
and a paid contract on equal terms with Regazzoni for two years.
are you crazy?
Clay's a senior figure in F1.
you're just a rookie!
the only reason we took you on is because you're paying us.
well, as of now, if you want me to stay, we rip up the contract, I don't pay you a cent.
that's outrageous!
was he quicker in my car?
he was, wasn't he?
did he go two seconds faster?
two point three.
so, have a think, work out your priorities and get back to me.
Hey, Niki.
I know what you're going to say, that it's none of my business.
what?
if it's the track manager you're taking on your date tonight.
it's none of your business.
okay, but if you want my advice,
I'd let this one go.
I'm not questioning your taste. She is a great girl, but...
Agnes' last boyfriend was a British Formula 2 driver who has a reputation for two things, for being a little crazy on the track...
and for going all night and all day...
and all night again in bed. He's a good driver, but an immortal fuck apparently.
I don't know about you, but that's not an act...
I'd like to follow.
but if that doesn't bother you...
what's his name, the driver?
hunt. James Hunt.
you see, you share information and I share information.
that's what teammates are for.
where the hell are we going? - I promise it'll be worth it.
just keep them closed.
wait for it.
wait for it.
there.
what do you say?
she's Formula 1.
Yes, she is, Superstar.
your brother and I got together with the bean counters.
and since the economics of F1 are not so significantly different to the economics of F2, well, we thought if we were going to be losing money, we might as well be doing it on the big roulette table in F1.
you fat, little, inbred beauty. Come here.
actually, credit where it's due, we got the idea from Niki.
who? - Lauda.
bought his way in rather than mess about in the lower divisions. I thought "Bloody hell, he's right."
no sponsorship, Superstar.
I hope you approve.
no vulgar logos for cigarettes or condoms.
just plain white with the flags.
and racing overalls which read "Sex. Breakfast of champions."
so when do we start?
soon as you're ready. - Ready?
I've been waiting for this my whole life.
village OF WATKINS GLEN
when the season started, people wondered whether Lord Hesketh and his team of upper-class enthusiasts were bringing glamour to the racing community or just comedy.
certainly it was the first time anyone had seen a Butler sewing oysters and caviar in the pits.
but they have made quite an impact.
6th in France, 4th in Britain and 3rd in Holland.
all drivers on the track, caution flags are out.
a severe crash at the Esses.
red flag. There's a car off the track.
and reports are reaching me that there's been a serious accident in qualifying.
the identity of the driver we don't currently have, but as you can tell from all the activity going on towards the track, it was clearly a grave incident indeed.
we will, of course, have more information as we get it, but it is the sight and sound of F1 nobody likes to see.
get your hands off me! - Hey, come on!
drivers of top stature we've lost just in the past 4 seasons have included Piers Courage,
jochen Rindt,
Jo Siffert,
Roger Williamson and today, at Watkins Glen,
formula 1 has claimed another driver.
the Tyrrell team have withdrawn from the race.
their places on the grid will be left empty.
terrible. - They should cancel the race.
Why?
he made a mistake, went into the corner too fast.
it's his fault.
is that right? - It's obvious.
look at the tyre marks.
so says the nobody, who had to pay for his own drive.
how's that working out for you, by the way?
fine.
how is it at the back?
not planning on being there for long.
ten minutes to the warm-up lap. Ten minutes.
arsehole.
heading into the Grand Hotel hairpin, second gear.
turn in hard, looking for late apex, gentle with the bar.
heading into Portier, second gear, clip the apex, light brake, stay in second, looking for a good exit.
heading through the tunnel, gradual right, up through third, fourth, fifth...
is Alexander around?
Yes, he was.
he went back to the house to take a call.
he'll be back shortly.
he only wanted to show me his pride and Joy.
rhymes with "boy" if you ask me.
and "toy."
God, it's so flimsy.
for something that costs so much.
there's no comfort, no protection, nothing.
no, it's just a little coffin, really.
surrounded by high-octane fuel in here.
being driven round 170 mph.
to all intents and purposes, this thing's a bomb on wheels.
you're James, aren't you?
Yes.
you fit the description.
is that right?
Suzy. Friend of Alex's.
Yeah, yeah.
I know exactly.
what was the description?
mostly positive in terms of appearance.
negative only in terms of character.
I've been told to avoid you.
by whom?
Alexander.
he says you're a bad boy.
alexander doesn't know what he's talking about.
I was. I'm not anymore.
the new me is very professional.
early to bed, early to rise.
all very dull, but according to the team, "the best way to keep beating the goose stepper."
is that what you were doing when I came in?
Yes, visualization techniques, memorising the circuit, in this case Monaco, which is up next.
personally I've always been a great believer...
in getting there on the day, putting my foot down...
and playing chicken with everyone else.
but they don't want me doing that anymore.
they want my body like a Temple and my mind like a monk.
and what about your soul, your heart?
they've got ideas about that, too.
they want me to stop messing around, settle down, get married with the next nice girl I meet.
they think that'd be good for me.
what do you think?
it sounds fucking awful.
but sine they're right about most things, they're probably right about that too.
you don't fancy getting married, do you?
Suzy.
Hey, hey, hey!
what's going on with him? - Nothing. Nothing.
didn't want to ruin your day.
it's...
it's the Kraut. - What about him?
he's just been signed by Ferrari.
you're kidding me?
Jesus. How did that happen?
did he buy his way in there too?
well, the old man took Regazzoni back and he insisted on it apparently.
he says that Niki's a genius setting up the cars.
Ferrari TEST TRACK FIORANO, ITALY
it's terrible. Drives like a pig.
you can't say that. - Why not?
it's a Ferrari! - It's a shitbox!
it understeers like crazy and the weight distribution is a disaster.
it's amazing, all these facilities and you make a piece of crap like this.
Ferrari family,
our good friend Clay Regazzoni.
you are family and friend to the commendatore as long as you win.
the minute you don't, ciao, ciao.
I totally understand.
it's business.
I would do the same.
but it isn't just business, is it?
what we do. It's passion, love.
which is why we are prepared to risk our lives for it.
not me.
if I had more talent and could earn better money with something else, I would.
how do you know you will make money here?
you haven't yet.
not yet, but I will.
if you can, I can.
you know, are you ever not an asshole?
why am I an asshole? - Well...
by now I'm both quicker than you and better at setting up a car.
you can't deal with it, so you're the asshole.
screw you.
I brought you along today because you seem like a lonely kind of guy.
I thought if I introduced you to some nice people, that could rub off on you.
forget it.
make your own friends.
come on, Clay.
I'm sorry.
are you leaving?
Yes.
can you give me a lift to the nearest town, anywhere with a train station?
sure.
Trento's half an hour's drive.
get in.
what are you doing?
you hear that noise when you accelerate?
no. - Your fan belt is loose.
my What?
and when you brake, your foot goes all the way down, which means there's air in the system.
anything else? - No.
apart from the rear brakes are worn out, the front right tyre is a bit soft, which explains why you're weaving so much.
how can you tell?
my ass. - Sorry?
God gave me an Ok mind, but a really good ass which can feel everything in a car.
you don't know what you're talking about.
this car is fine. I just had a service a week ago.
not a good one.
Yes, a very good one, very expensive.
this car's as good as new. Relax.
you're not in a hurry, are you? - No.
as long as I'm back in Maranello Monday morning.
Yes.
actually, we do, yeah. - It's my honor, Niki.
thank you. - My car is your car.
on one condition, though.
it's a piece of shit. It's dog shit.
but if you drive it, you make my life, Niki, eh?
would someone please tell me what's going on?
who are you? Should I know you? - What, you don't know?
he's Niki Lauda, Formula 1 driver, and he just signed with Ferrari.
him? - Yes.
impossible. - Why?
well, you know, Formula 1 drivers, they have long hair, are sexy...
their shins are open to here.
thank you. - Yes.
anyway, look at the way he's driving, like an old man.
there's no need to drive fast.
it just increases the percentage of risk.
we're not in a hurry. I'm not being paid.
right now, with zero incentive or reward, why would I drive fast?
because I'm asking you to.
this is an incredible battle between Niki Lauda in the red Ferrari and James Hunt in the white Hesketh.
...the challenge of Niki Lauda...
Lauda attacking Hunt. He gets through on the inside.
goes wide at the exit.
hunt is past again.
once more, Lauda tries to sneak up the inside.
they're absolutely side by side, wheel to wheel.
so evenly matched.
fantastic battle between these two great drivers.
hunt is now ahead once more.
but Lauda's coming back again now.
Lauda once more sneaks up the inside.
and again he runs wide. Again the Hesketh...
Suzy, we're ready, come on. - Just one second.
can we go, yeah? - Okay, yeah.
we're in the closing laps of this race at Watkins Glen.
they come down the hill.
and Hunt's got a problem!
hunt pulls across to the left!
Lauda goes ahead on his own.
a sad end to a wonderful battle.
hunt pushing off the marshal.
the chequered flag is waiting for Lauda and for Ferrari!
the title going to Niki Lauda, who wins the race, who wins the World Championship.
do I look like a racing driver now?
Congratulations. - Thank you.
Marlene.
with a car like that, the rest of us never stood a chance, did we?
maybe the car being so good has something to do with me.
come on, Niki. You're in a Ferrari.
I'm in a Hesketh.
equal terms, the way it was in Formula 3, - Id' beat you and you know it. - Never.
you might win one race, maybe two, because you're aggressive.
but in the long run, over the course of a season, no chance.
right. Why is that?
because to be a champion, it takes more than just being quick.
it's the whole picture.
you're just a charger and a party guy.
that's why everybody likes you.
try saying that and tell me you're not jealous.
why would I be jealous? Think about it.
all that affection, all those smiles, is a sign of disrespect.
they don't fear you. Whereas compared that to me.
Yes, compared to you, whom no one likes.
right. - Not even his own teammates.
right. Because I'm a serious guy.
I go to bed early, I look after myself, after my car.
Yes, you're very well-behaved. - Go to work, kick ass.
and then, after the race, I go home instead of going to bars and talk all this bullshit with all these assholes.
Arseholes?
you should go home more often too.
I heard you got married.
Yes, I did.
so where is she, this mysterious wife?
in New York, working.
you know, I've never seen you with her once.
no?
well, maybe that's because you're always at home, on your own, looking after yourself, being a good little boy.
take a drink on me, James.
thank you, Niki. I might just have two.
right, Bubbles, whatever it takes to beat that prick next year, just say it, you're word is my command.
there are no lengths to which I will not go.
and I mean it.
what the hell's going on?
where is everybody?
what's the matter?
do you know what the date it is today?
Yes. It's November, the 14th. Why?
do you have any idea of the significance of that date?
I don't know. Time to start killing pheasants?
actually, it's the deadline for securing sponsorship for the forthcoming Formula 1 season.
yes?
which elapsed at midnight last night - and we didn't attract any. - Well, so?
we aren't looking for sponsorship.
like you said, condoms an cigarettes, vulgar, right?
right.
except we are, or were.
I've made something of a miscalculation.
the economics, Formula 1, realities thereof.
it turns out not like the lower divisions at all.
what are you saying?
I'm saying it's over, Superstar.
the banks have stepped in, started laying everyone off.
probably have to sell this place.
on, Christ.
I need a drive, Pete. I need you to find me a drive.
I mean, what about Lotus?
you don't wanna know.
actually, I do. - Okay.
they felt your reputation preceded you.
and what does that mean?
it's my other line. Look, I'll get back to you.
Peter Hunt.
fuck!
don't worry. Something will turn up.
doubt that will help in the meantime.
why don't we go away at the weekend?
skiing.
before I go back to New York.
talk to me, James. Don't make a stranger of me.
you know, Suzy, only a stranger would invite me skiing...
when they know I haven't got a fucking drive!
I can't watch this.
what were you hoping for anyway?
a well-adjusted knight in shining armour?
no danger of that.
let me give you some advice. - I'm all ears.
don't go to men who are willing to kill themselves driving in circles looking for normality.
I never expected normality.
God knows I walked into this with my eyes open.
I just hoped I'd married someone who is half as impressive on the inside as he is on the outside!
at least there's something behind the facade.
James. - Fuck off to New York, dear.
there must be a moisturiser or an eye shadow somewhere...
that needs your vapid mush to flog it.
Hello? - Hi, James.
it's Peter. Something's up at McLaren.
what have you heard? - Nothing. Why?
I heard Emerson's off. He's dumped them in it.
Jesus. Get me in there, Pete.
say anything, just get me in that room.
I'll come straight to the point.
our esteemed lead driver... - Fitti-fucking-Paldi.
has ditched us for another team at the last minute.
Coper-fucking-Sucar. - And we need a replacement.
Asa-fucking-P.
fortunately a few hands have already gone up, good people.
jacky Ickx. - I'm quicker than Jacky.
but he's consistent, dependable.
a grown-up.
right, and will he go for that gap when no one else will?
will he put his life on the line the day it really matters?
the sponsors like him.
what do you want, a driver or a brush salesman?
we wanna be successful. - Yes, so do I.
but that means beating Niki Lauda, not being a show pony for sponsors.
I heard about this thing with Niki.
everyone has.
you really thing you can beat him?
I'd beat him in a McLaren.
it's the only car out there as quick as the Ferrari.
which is why I'm here, begging.
I'll do whatever you ask.
I'll put on a tie, I'll smile for sponsors, say the right things.
I can beat this guy, trust me.
just give me the drive.
Yeah, he can be a loose canon.
and, yeah, he will drive you all mad, but in terms of raw talent and right stuff, there is no better driver in the world.
he's the real thing, Teddy.
he's what we all came into this for.
nine days out of ten you'll be pulling your hair out, but on that tenth day James will be unbeatable.
that is the day you will wish you had him in your car.
you'll never win the championship with Jacky Ickx.
you just might with James.
Grande PREMIO DO BRAZIL INTERLAGOS
1976/1/1
welcome to São Paulo, Brazil, and the Interlagos circuit for the first race in the 1976 Formula 1 season, where the main news is James Hunt qualified fastest, beating Niki Lauda's Ferrari to pole position by just 200th of a second.
new car.
I noticed. - Pole position.
I noticed that too.
level playing field now, my rally little friend.
Yeah.
let's see where we are after lap one.
let's see where we are in five races time.
hunt has the pit Lane pole position, which should give him the best chance of outdragging Lauda's Ferrari.
if ever there was a doubt about whether Lauda had a serious challenger to this season,
hunt and his McLaren have certainly given us the answer.
brazil LAUDA WINS
hunt HAS ENGINE FAILURE
grand PRIX SOUTH AFRICA 76
here in South Africa, James Hunt is determined...
to make amends after that disastrous retirement in Brazil.
but it's Lauda who takes the flag here at Kyalami.
James Hunt comes home second to confirm his championship challenge at last and score his first points of the season.
that wind you can feel is me breathing down your neck.
next time I'll have you.
we'll see in Spain.
SPAIN-HUNT WINS LAUDA 2ND
James Hunt finally takes his first victory of the season here in Spain, after a brilliant drive.
it was only a matter of time.
it's too wide. - Disqualified.
what? - You're disqualified.
how can we be disqualified?
1. 5 cm. - It's the same car.
...McLaren M23 has proved very controversial here.
just make it narrower. I don't care how.
new rear suspension. New wishbones.
I wanna make sure this thing is legal, no doubts.
then we'd better move the oil coolers to the old position.
the wing brackets need... - Fuck.
what the fuck d'you think we're doing?
grand PRIX MONACO 76
and with Hunt disqualified from his Spain win, his championship here is not going well.
and now it's all gone wrong here at Monaco!
his engine is smoking!
smoke pouring from the engine of that McLaren!
and James Hunt is out!
can you tell us what happened?
sure. It's magic, we've taken a great car, a great piece of engineering and overnight turned it...
into a big, huge stinking turd.
belgium MAY 1976
shit!
what the hell have you done? The car's evil!
it's fucking undriveable!
if there's a problem with the car, we'll fix it.
the car is a piece of shit. You should be appealing this.
we are appealing. - We'll son it out.
they're killing us out there. - Go an get your dick wet.
you're a wanker! - Fuck you!
you're fucking wanker!
but this was a good race for you, no, Niki?
it's good for everyone that the quickest car happens to be a legal car.
James, your 50 points behind Lauda in the championship.
you've had another retirement today.
what's going wrong?
it's dirty politics and dirty tricks, that's what's going wrong.
so as we approach the halfway point in this year's Formula 1 season,
Ferrari and Niki Lauda seem clearly on top and James Hunt and McLaren are struggling.
so, five races in, how's it going so far?
it's fine. Just got a little problem with an Austrian rat...
and his team of Italian cheats who've destroyed my car.
what are you talking about? - About the race in Spain I won.
Yeah, in a car which is not legal.
five eighths of an inch too wide.
you know that doesn't have the slightest effect on speed.
but you complained and your team of lawyers...
leaned on the authorities. Now we've had to rebuild the car - and it's become a monster. - At least it's a legal monster.
you've had to resort to cheating.
you're driving an illegal car and call me a cheater? Pathetic.
rules are rules. - Yes, and rats are rats.
thank you. Thank you.
do you really think it upsets me, James, calling me a rat because I look like one?
I don't mind it.
rats are ugly, sure, and nobody like them, but they're very intelligent and they have a strong survival instinct.
wonderful.
no wonder she left him.
anyone seen Suzy?
she's supposed to be here today.
we didn't wanna tell you before the race.
tell me what?
Suzy JOINS THE BURTON SHOW.
hunt's WIFE SEES ACTOR AS LIZ FLIES TO MUM
Jesus.
blonde model Suzy Hunt...
stepped on to the dizzy Elizabeth Taylor-Richard Burton...
roundabout of romance yesterday.
is that from him?
Yeah.
so when did all this start?
that weekend I went skiing.
why have you come here, James?
I've got to get you back.
you don't want me back.
you never wanted to be married in the first place.
Yes, I did. - Oh, come on, James.
you did it because you hoped it might change you, settle you down, help with the racing.
no, I didn't.
and who knows, if it had been just the drinking, or the dope, or the infidelity or the moods, it might even have worked.
but when it's all of them... - Yes, I know, I'm terrible.
no, you're not terrible.
you're just who you are at this point in your life.
God help anyone who wants more.
and Richard Burton, will he be able to give you more?
you know, he has quite the bad boy reputation himself.
what's important is how it feels to me, and it feels like he adores me.
James!
are you and Suzy getting back together?
it's all very amicable.
my wife has found herself a new backer...
I mean, lover, which makes her happy.
and Mr. Burton has found a way of feeling young again, which makes him happy.
let's hope his pockets are deep. They'll need to be.
and I found a way to be single and have an ex-wife without it costing me a Penny, which has to go down as the biggest win of my career.
I have a flight to catch.
Suzy HUNT RACES TO RICHARD BURTON
circuit PAUL RICARD CHAMPIONNAT DU MONDE
we haven't seen this sort of intensity from James Hunt all season long.
reports have been coming out of the McLaren camp all week...
that their car is now fully legal and faster than ever.
FRANCE-HUNT WINS LAUDA RETIRES
never mind the bloody wets. We're still quick.
british GRAND PRIX
brands HATCH SUNDAY 18TH JULY 1976
hunt has really closed the gap on Lauda...
as they head into Druids.
Niki Lauda is under real pressure from James Hunt as they go up the hill into Druids Corner.
and Hunt is in front of Lauda!
so James Hunt gets the plaudits of the crowd, the first Briton to win a British Grand Prix...
at Brands Hatch since Jim Clark in 1964.
James, at the moment you've got a terrific edge over the rest, how have you achieved this advantage?
big balls.
following an inquiry into the disqualification of driver James Hunt from the Spanish Grand Prix, it has been decided to overturn this disqualification and to restore his victory and reinstate his points.
James!
James, a few weeks ago you were out of the running completely...
and now you're right back in it. What's changed?
it's a combination of factors, not all of which I'm prepared to discuss here.
but justice being done re the disqualification in Spain...
helps and having my car back at its best again.
are you worried?
welcome to the legendary Nürburgring.
this is a 14. 2 mile track, complete with 185 corners and bends.
welcome to the Nürburgring, the most dangerous circuit on the season calendar.
in Formula 1 it is known as "The Graveyard."
the weather conditions are far from ideal...
and latest reports indicate there is no relief in sight.
gentlemen.
well, gentlemen, please be quiet.
thank you.
Niki Lauda. - Thank you.
I called this meeting because, as all you drivers know, the Nürburgring is the most stupid, barbaric, outdated...
and dangerous track in the world.
you've all seen the rain that has been falling today.
those of you with experience know the ring...
needs perfect conditions to be even remotely acceptable...
in terms of risk.
and today, with the rain, it's anything but perfect, so I called this meeting to take vote to cancel the race.
cancel the race?
there would be no change to the situation...
as far as points is concerned.
the race would simply be cancelled.
this is bullshit!
if the race is cancelled, none of us get our race fees.
that's true, you leave without your fee, but you might leave with your life.
it also means that you would effectively win...
so I can see why this suits you just fine.
Why?
there won't be no points for me either.
no, but there'd be one race less where I, or anyone else here, - could catch you. - James is right.
this is just tactics!
maybe he's just frightened.
which asshole said this?
Yes, of course, I'm frightened, and so are you.
I accept every time I get in my car...
there's 20% chance I could die, and I can live with it, but not one percent more.
and today, with the rain, the risk is more.
I suppose that all depends on how good you are in the rain.
I have the track record here.
I'm the only person in history to do the ring in under 7 Min. so, actually, it's to my advantage to race here today.
because I'm quicker than all of you.
come on. - Fine. Then let's race.
Yeah!
Niki, let's race. - Gentlemen, please.
why are we here, Niki? Come on.
well, all those in favor of cancelling the race.
all those in favor of racing.
gentlemen, the race is on.
ridiculous. - What a waste of time.
you know, Niki, every now and then...
it helps if people like you.
in places the track is still dangerously wet, but following a drivers meeting, a decision has been taken.
one minute to go.
Jochen's going on slicks. You wanna change?
is Niki gonna change? - No.
then we stay on wets too.
Niki, okay? - I'm good.
all right, fire her up.
this season's fight for the F1 World Championship...
has so far been the story of two men.
thus far it's been going pretty much the way of Niki Lauda.
but James Hunt has qualified fastest here.
he is on pole position for the German Grand Prix...
with Niki Lauda alongside in the blood-red Ferrari.
it's a long race.
if the track starts to dry out, the wet-weather tyres will no longer be as quick.
Niki Lauda and James Hunt, side by side on the front of the grid, go away absolutely as one!
Lauda very aggressive on Hunt there, forcing the McLaren onto the grass.
Lauda has the lead right now! He leads into the first corner!
hunt is in second place!
mass storming past Hunt!
he made the right choice to go with the dry-weather tyres.
mass passing Lauda now!
jochen Mass, in the number 12 McLaren, takes the lead!
jochen Mass, the clear leader, with everybody else...
making the decision to change tyres...
after just one lap of this race.
come on, let's go!
see? I told you to go on slicks. You should've taken my advice.
fuck off. Where's Niki?
behind you. He made the same mistake.
come on!
come on! What's going on?
the tyre-changing frenzy caused a huge reshuffling of the pack, - with Mass in the lead now. - You're clear. Go!
Lauda urging his mechanics to hurry.
it's a disaster! Come on!
what's going on, you assholes?
this race has gone wrong for him so far.
his championship rival, James Hunt, is a long way up the road.
Lauda passing car after car. He's just going past.
mario Andretti's Lotus there.
NIKI!
get me out!
help me!
several cars are involved.
looks like it might be one of the Ferraris.
come this way! - Come on, come on!
keep trying!
come this way. - Okay.
the flood, which swept down Big Thompson Canyon in Colorado, was the worst since records began.
in Formula 1 today, victory celebrations were muted...
after a horrific accident involving world champion.
Niki Lauda.
due to safety concerns before the race, the Austrian had said he would not take pan, but in the end he did.
he was making up for lost time when he went off the track, puncturing the Ferrari's fuel tank.
Brett Lunger was unable to avoid the flaming wreck...
but was unhurt and joined other drivers to rescue Lauda, who was taken to Manheim Hospital with severe burns, the incident reminding us again of the dangers of Formula 1.
Niki Lauda was trapped for almost a minute...
in a searing inferno of 800-plus degrees.
James Hunt gains on the absent Niki Lauda.
28th DAY IN HOSPITAL 29th August 1976.
morning, chaps. - Hey, here's the man.
looking good.
what's going on? - Jesus. It's Niki.
what about him? - He's here.
what? - He's racing.
Niki.
it's that bad, huh?
no.
in hospital, I asked them straight, no bullshit, how bad my appearance would be.
they said with time it would be fine.
but it won't.
I can tell, seeing your reaction.
I'll spend the rest of my life with a face that frightens people.
you know, Niki, I tried to write you a letter at the time, to apologise.
the drivers' meeting in Germany, before the race.
I swayed the room. - Yes, you did.
that race should never have gone ahead.
no, it shouldn't.
so in many ways I feel responsible for what happened...
you were.
but, trust me, watching you win those races, while I was fighting for my life...
you were equally responsible for getting me back in the car.
how are you feeling, Niki? - Fine.
Niki, can you confirm to us exactly which procedures you had...
and the expectations for you recovery?
sure.
I had a skin graft operation...
where they put half my right thigh in my face.
now, it doesn't look too good, but one unexpected advantage is...
it's impossible to perspire through a skin graft, so sweat will never run into my eyes again, which is good for a driver.
when they heard about your condition,
Ferrari immediately hired a replacement driver,
Carlos Reutemann.
Yeah, before ever reaching the hospital.
is Reutemann driving today too? - Yes.
and keen to make an impression.
so let's see where Mr. Reutemann finishes...
and where I finish today.
James Hunt and McLaren have caught up a lot...
while you were away.
Yes.
so is there a question now...
or are you just trying to piss me off?
you still think you can win?
Yes, of course.
I have the better car.
and possibly I'm the better driver.
but he's a clever guy and he's used his time well...
while I was lying half-dead in hospital...
to win some points.
and what did your wife say when she saw your face?
she said, "Sweetie, "you don't need a face to drive. You just need the right foot.
I'm being serious.
do you really think your marriage can survive...
with the way you look now?
and I'm being serious too.
fuck you.
press conference over.
that was hairy. - You know how to get noticed.
I thought it went well, to be honest.
they don't like it when it's not going their way.
that's the game.
see you. - See you later.
James, are you all right? - Good, yeah.
I think I've got something for you on that last question, - About Niki. - You heard about that?
James?
please, James...
now go home to your wife and ask her how you look.
prick.
so Niki Lauda, just 42 days...
after his near-fatal accident at Nürburgring, will race here today, at Monza...
against all medical advice and no doubt in incredible pain.
photographers, please, clear the grid.
Niki, it's time.
okay?
please, clear the grid.
one minute to go.
the returning Niki Lauda seems overwhelmed.
he's been overtaken by car after car.
Lauda's off line. He runs wide onto the grass.
he wrestles it back onto the track, but that was a bad moment for Niki.
Niki Lauda's the reigning world champion, but maybe in his current state he's a danger out there, to himself and to the rest of the field.
and Stuck has collided with Mario Andretti's Lotus!
Niki's boxed in! He's got nowhere to go!
Niki Lauda's actually making a move.
he's on Brambilla's tail.
he pulls out of the slipstream to overtake.
Lauda's starting to find the form...
that early in this race we believed he'd lost.
Lauda's now lapping faster than Reutemann...
and closing the gap ahead.
Lauda closing on Carlos Reutemann, the man called in to be his replacement.
and there's James Hunt's McLaren, smoking stationary by the side of the road.
this is bad news for Hunt's championship hopes.
it's Ronnie Peterson...
who comes home the winner here at Monza.
but all eyes are on the man who finishes a brilliant fourth!
Niki Lauda!
what a race, what a man, what a season.
with a 4th-place finish and three priceless points,
Niki Lauda is a major step closer...
to retaining the World Championship.
so the long, grueling and incredibly dramatic season...
comes down to this final race in Japan, in the shadow of Mount Fuji.
Niki Lauda goes into this deciding race at Fuji...
just three points ahead of James Hunt,
hunt knowing he must beat the Austrian fair and square...
to take the title.
James, do you think you can cope with the pressure?
well, I've never really understood what that means.
I love my job. I love competing. I love racing.
maybe you should ask Niki. He's the World Champion.
he's got everything to lose.
Mr. Lauda, are you feeling pressure?
do I look like I'm feeling pressure?
I'm World Champion...
and on the verge to become World Champion again.
hunt now has the opportunity to win, but it's not so easy to become a champion.
you have to really believe it to make it possible.
James, is there anything you'd like to add?
if Niki is being tricky and getting a kicky...
out of playing mind games, then fine, I'm flattered.
the fact is momentum is with me. I've never felt better.
I fully expect the next press conference we will have...
will be with me as World Champion.
intermittent heavy rain has been forecast...
here at Fuji today, along with strong winds...
rolling in from the mountain.
and so with today's Japanese Grand Prix to come,
Lauda's lead a mere three points.
what a way to finish the season.
hunt or Lauda?
the final chapter will unfold when we bring you extended coverage...
they've got to cancel the race.
it's lethal out there.
the race is going ahead.
television rights have been sold all around the world.
the showdown between you and Niki...
is all anyone wants to see.
with heavy rain continuing to fall here at Fuji, a decision has finally been made.
the 1976 Japanese Grand Prix will go ahead.
all drivers to your cars, please.
five minutes to go.
all right? - All right.
hold still. - What the hell are you doing?
to let the condensation out.
it'll also let the water in. - Not if you're leading.
trust me, this race is all about the start.
need a hand here? - Yeah, hold it, Teddy.
okay, start the bastard.
good luck, kid.
good luck, James!
30 seconds to go.
electric tension here at Fuji.
80, 000 bedraggled race fans...
and the racing grudge match of the decade.
and there's Mario Andretti in pole position,
James Hunt alongside him.
on row two of the grid, there is Niki Lauda, and on row three of the grid, Joe Schecketer from South Africa...
in the six-wheel Tyrrell.
behind him, the rest of the 25-car field.
there's the flag, and finally the Japanese Grand Prix is underway!
in this conditions it must be almost impossible...
to drive a 450-horsepower car!
and it's Andretti who has the lead, but Hunt is attacking.
hunt's going round the outside of Andretti!
Niki Lauda following him through!
hunt leads into the first right-hander!
hunt comes through to complete his first lap leading the field.
at least he has clear vision in front of him.
Niki Lauda behind him, eating his spray.
Lauda is slowing!
Niki Lauda is bringing the Ferrari no. 1 into the pit!
some sort of problem, we can't imagine what, so early in the race.
what's wrong with the car?
what's wrong with the car?
NIKI! What's wrong with the car?
nothing. Car's perfect.
what are you doing?
I'm stopping.
his mechanics are asking what the problem is.
but wait! Niki Lauda's getting out of the car!
this is sensational!
the reigning World Champion, Niki Lauda, is out of this race.
it's too dangerous.
Niki, you want me to say...
there was a problem with the car, for the media?
no.
tell them the truth.
now, what is happening?
they're talking to the team manager.
Lauda explaining something.
with Lauda out, James Hunt knows he has to finish this race in third place or higher to be World Champion.
but the job's not done yet for James Hunt.
in these dreadful conditions, he still has to go the distance.
fifteen laps to go here at Fuji.
James Hunt or Niki Lauda?
this extraordinary season is not over yet.
in this treacherous final round, can James Hunt hang on?
and the scoreboard tells a story. Lap 58.
hunt in the lead.
Oh, God, his tyres, they're blistering.
brambilla very close behind him, closing on him all the time.
and he's trying to drive inside James Hunt.
hunt cuts across the orange March nose.
hunt not having that at all. And he's spinning.
he missed Hunt but almost took James Hunt out of the race...
and out of the world championship.
now we find Mario Andretti closing on James Hunt.
mario Andretti's going past Hunt!
hunt is slowing. James Hunt seems to have a problem.
despite this wet conditions, these wet-weather tyres wear extremely fast.
hunt's tyres, they're gone.
hunt nursing his car back to the pit stop.
that back marker's going past Hunt.
lap 70 4 LAPS TO GO
look at that left front tyre, right front tyre, sorry.
no tread on it at all. And the other one is flat.
let's go! Let's go!
okay? When did you break your gear lever?
nine or ten laps ago.
alistair, we need to lift it! - Come on!
at the front! - Let's go!
Regazzoni's Ferrari and Jacques Lafitte in the Ligier...
have gone ahead.
come on, hurry!
you did it. You're going to be World Champion!
not yet.
a few laps ago, James Hunt was looking like champion elect.
now it looks as though it's all gone wrong for him.
James. - Come on!
listen. - What?
just go easy out there.
what are you saying? - I'm saying look after yourself.
we want you back in one piece.
you're too far back. There's too many drivers in front of you.
there's always next year. - So that's it? It's over?
clear!
James!
clear! - Fuck it!
James Hunt rejoins the race in sixth position.
there are four laps to go. Surely no way back for the Brit.
concentrate, Superstar.
just brings it back under control!
sliding the McLaren on the very edge there.
hunt's M23 twitching this way and that under braking.
and he almost loses it right there.
hunt on the tail of Jacques Lafitte...
in the blue Ligier.
don't do it, James.
he's inches away from the pit wall!
he's inches away from the Ligier!
James Hunt has made up another place, but it's not enough and this race is running out.
and Watson has spun! Watson has spun!
hunt manages to weave his way between the back marker...
and the stationary Penske.
he's catching Regazzoni, but in these conditions, it's one thing to catch up, quite another to overtake.
he's alongside Clay Regazzoni! This could be the world championship!
he's got him!
hunt crosses the line.
he needed to finish third to score enough points...
to be World Champion, and in the confusion here we're being told...
that he may have finished 5th.
he finished fifth?
our lap charts show Hunt in third place.
well, if the scoreboard's right, it means he's just missed out on the championship.
crushing defeat for Hunt after such a heroic drive.
I can see the race stewards conferring, examining the official lap charts.
we're just going to have to wait for their verdict here.
let's get you out of here, buddy.
I'm sorry, Teddy. I thought I could make up the ground.
sorry? What are you talking about? You did it!
did what? - Jesus! You crazy bastard!
you came 3rd! You got the points!
you're champion of the world!
James Hunt is now officially confirmed...
as finishing third here in Japan, and that means he is champion of the world.
our new World Champion, James Hunt, by just one single point.
did we really win?
world bloody Champion!
what are you going to do now? - I shall be getting drunk.
it's wonderful, absolute dream.
and our special guest, Formula 1 champion, James Hunt.
James HUNT WORLD CHAMPION
James HUNT AGAINST ALL ODDS
wait. Come on.
there's no better motor oil than Havoline.
Yes, me too. Where we going? - Anywhere I want to go.
and I don't have to hijack it, either.
as long as I pay for it.
I'm starving. Let's get some food.
Bologna, ITALY - Where are you going? - You lot go ahead.
I won't be a minute.
NIKI!
good to see you!
I heard you were spending more and more time...
in one of these. - Do you fly?
no.
I don't think they'd insure me. - You should try.
it's good for discipline.
you have to stay within the rules, stick to regulation, suppress the ego.
it helps with the racing.
and there I was thinking you were about to wax lyrical...
about the romance of flight. - No, that's all bullshit.
so what brings you here?
a friend's wedding.
at least I think it was a wedding.
might have been a birthday or something.
it's all a bit of a blur.
have you been at Fiorano? - Pre-season testing.
you're relentless. - Thank you.
I'm not sure that was meant as a compliment.
when do you start testing? Next week?
no. What, are you nuts?
I didn't just win the biggest thing of my life...
so I could get right back to work.
Why? You have to.
to prove to all the people...
who will always say you just won it because...
because of what? Because of your accident?
Niki, is that other people or is that you?
I won, okay?
on the all-important day when it came down to it, we raced on equal terms, equally good cars.
and I put my life on the line and I saw it through.
and you call that winning? - Yes.
the risks were totally unacceptable.
you were prepared to die.
to me, that's losing. - Yes, I was. I admit it.
I was prepared to die to beat you that day.
and that's the effect you have on me.
you'd pushed me that far. And it felt great!
I mean, hell, isn't that what we're in this for?
to stare death in the face and to cheat it?
come on, there's nobility in that.
it's like being knights.
you English, you're such assholes.
you know my position.
20% risk.
no, Niki, don't bring the percentages into this.
don't be a pro.
the minute you do that, you kill what's good about this.
you kill the sport.
James!
James! - Come on!
I've got to go.
careful in this thing.
James.
in hospital, the toughest part of my treatment was the vacuum.
pumping the shit out of my lungs.
it was hell.
and while doing it, I was watching television.
you winning all my points. - Your points?
"that bastard, Hunt," I'd say. "I hate that guy."
and one day, the doctor came and said, "Mr. Lauda, may I offer a piece of advice?"
stop thinking of it as a curse to have been given an enemy in life.
it can be blessing too.
a wise man gets more from his enemies...
than a fool from his friends.
and you know what? He was right.
look at us.
we were both a pair of kids when we met.
hot-headed jerks in Formula 3.
disowned by our families. Headed nowhere.
and now we're both champions of the world.
it was not bad.
no, it's not bad.
so don't let me down now.
I need you busting my balls.
get back to work. - I will, Niki, I will.
but I intend to enjoy myself first.
some of life needs to be for pleasure.
what's the point of having a million cups, medals and planes...
if you don't have any fun?
how is that winning?
James! - We're gonna leave without you!
James!
I'll see you on race day, champ.
you will...
champ.
you look good, Niki.
the only guy to have burnt his face and it be an improvement.
of course he didn't listen to me.
for James, one world title was enough.
he had proved what he needed to prove, to himself and anyone who doubted him.
and two years later he retired.
when I saw him next in London seven years later, me as champion again, him as broadcaster, he was barefoot on a bicycle, with a flat tyre.
still living each day like his last.
when I heard he'd died aged 45, of a heart attack,
I wasn't surprised.
I was just sad.
people always think of us as rivals, but he was among the very few I liked...
and even fewer that I respected.
he remains the only person I envied.
hot stuff baby this evening Gotta have some hot stuff Gotta have some love tonight Hot stuff
guys, our train doesn't leave till morning.
where will we sleep? - What do you mean, sleep?
we can sleep on the train tomorrow.

hello there.
welcome to Club Vandersexxx...

how sad for you to grow up in a country founded by prudes.
a country overrun with crime and illiteracy.
a country where a man is forced to make sex to only one woman at a time, and one must learn the woman's name beforehand.
it was horrible. - I know.
but you can come with me...
and let the Vandersexxx begin.
marijuana in my soul Your iguana in my hall
I can't believe we're doing this.

I like to smoke marijuana - You wanna do this? - Yeah.
I need a new battery for my camera, and while you're at it, it could use a cleaning.

actually, it's an M7.
it's got the built-in light meter.
it's so beautiful.
so sleek, so powerful.
how's the new lens system?

I guess I really haven't done that much.
I haven't really found the time, with all my extracurriculars, and model U. N. advanced placement classes, after-school tutor...
...ing! Ah!
gosh, you really like cameras!
sometimes, we find our clients are so overwhelmed with the pleasure, that they sometimes scream out, "no,
when really they mean, "yes.
and this is why we have the safe word.
the "safe word"?
if at any time the ecstasy gets too great, you just use the safe word.
until we hear the safe word, we will not stop.
Yeah, right. Stop. All right.
we're going to start slowly, teasing you with a little light erotic foreplay.
Whee!
Oh, yes, ladies!

I'm freaking out! I think we got a bad batch 'cause I'm freaking out.
I can't... I can't do this.
I saw a gay porno once. I didn't know until halfway in.

I am freaking out!!
everything all right with you? - No, nothing's all right.
you sold us a bad batch of hash brownies.
you're a bad Rastafarian.
these are not hash brownies.
hmm?
what was that? - We do not sell hash brownies.
we're a simple Dutch bakery!

for shame!
Oh, that's me.
coop here. Sorry.
Hello, Mr. Walters.
you never got the Gutterman file?
I told Humphrey to give it to you.
that's hogwash. I handed it to him myself yesterday.
I'll tell Humphrey to report to your office immediately.
Bye.
this job's killing me.
uh... - Let me handle this.
I speak bad German.
what did he say? - He said he's driving.
Oh. - Something.

Yeah.
I love America.
we just get "Miami Vice" on television.
Miami Vice" is number one new show.
Yeah.
listen, we're trying to get to Berlin, Germany.
do you know if there's a train coming anytime soon?
Oh, yes, very soon. They are building it now.
stop! Hammer time!
enjoy Bratislava!
it's good you came in summer.
in winter, it can get very depressing.
we gotta figure something out. How much money do we have?
Frommer's travel tip.
I don't have anything.
what? I got noth... fine.
$1. 83 American.

Hapi Djus.

Ah! A nickel!

I quit!
I open my own hotel!

my Scotty - Scotty, Scotty Scotty doesn't know Don't tell Scotty Scotty doesn't know
this song sounds familiar.
Jenny, lemme check your coat.
Hey! - Jenny!
that outfit is horrible! Just take it off... now!
no, but I will let you buy me a drink.
excuse me!
you are the woman from the Paris train station, aren't you?
my name is... - Christoph.
Yes.
what are you doing here?
this is my place. My family owns many nightclubs in Europe.
I'd be honored if you'd join me in my V. I.P. Room for a drink.
Mmm-kay.
Bye, Cooper.
what's that? - It's absinthe.
Frommer's says it's illegal in the States because it makes you hallucinate and go crazy.
they call it "the green fairy.
my family has a yacht in the Aegean.
come with me, Jennifer. We will sail away together.
Oh, my God!
we will swim with dolphins, and sip champagne by moonlight.
Oh, my God!
we will spend the day sunbathing, drinking wine.
my wife makes the best sangria.
wait... what?
sangria.
you take a good Spanish Rioja, and you put in slices of orange, and...
no, wait. You said you were married?
you go around Europe sleeping with every woman you meet?
no, please, Jennifer. It is not like that.
I also sleep with men.
I gotta say, I'm not feeling anything.
me neither.
sober as a judge.
how 'bout you?
I'm not feeling a goddamn thing.
this absinthe is bullshit!
I hear you, my brother.
I'm outta here.
excuse me.
Hey, so where's Christoph? - Shut up.
Europe! - Europe!
Whoo! - Europe!
so, tomorrow, Berlin.
tomorrow, Mieke!
check it out.
no way!
Jamie's hooking up with another girl? Goddamn it!
it's just so unfair. I've been all over,
Iooking for crazy European sex, and he's the one who ends up...
Oh, my God!
that is some pretty fucked-up shit.
can you say, "What the fuck did I do last night?
they really are the worst twins ever.
that was a pretty wild night, eh?
Yep. Pretty wild, pretty wild.
I know I was out of control.
how about you guys? Did you...?
all right, look. We were really drunk, things got a little crazy, and Jamie...
kissed me.
let's just forget about it, 'kay?
consider it forgotten. - Never happened.
never happened.
fine. Let's just forget about it.
it's not like you two had sex.
have you had sex? - Shut up, Cooper!
Jamie, relax. Cooper. Please?
OK, fine. I'll give it a rest.
Jamie, could I borrow your Frommer's?
Oh, here it is. Bratislava.
hmm. Capital of Slovakia.
Oh, here's a fun fact.
you made out with your sister, man!
shut up! Shut up! Shut up! - Like two dogs in heat.
my friends, where is the beef?
you go to Berlin? I'm your ride.
hop in.
this is Mieke's apartment building.
wish me all sorts of luck, guys.
you'll do great, Scotty.
Thanks.
I came all this way. I'm not gonna miss this.
dude, Mieke's hideous! Run! - Stop.
Hi, my name is Scott Thomas.
I'm from America, and I'm here to see Mieke.
I'm sorry, but Mieke's not here.
do you know where she is?
she's gone for the summer.
my daughter had intended to spend the summer in America,
Iooking at colleges and visiting some friends.
but several days ago, she suddenly changed her mind.
she would not tell me why.
I think I know why.
this is Heinrich. He's Mieke's stepbrother.
as I was saying, she packed up her bag and left.
it was all very sudden. - Do you know where she is now?
she's always been very interested in the classics,
greek and Roman literature, history, and she's always enjoyed the ocean, so she found a program that combines all her interests.
do you know where she is?
she enrolled in a summer at sea program, based in Rome.
Rome.
OK, then I guess we'll go to Rome, then.
unfortunately, Mieke's only in Rome for orientation.
tomorrow her group boards a boat and she'll be gone for the summer.
she'll be quite unreachable.
unreachable.
Mieke's tour group goes to the Vatican tomorrow, then she gets on that boat and she's gone.
so, it's over?
thanks for sticking with me through this, guys, but...
you should probably call your parents, have them wire you some money and go home.
what are you gonna do?
I'm going to Rome.
I'll walk, I'll hitchhike,
I'll swim if I have to, but I'll get to Mieke somehow.
maybe that'll help.
Where'd you get all that?
wait. Where's your Leica?
sold it.
what?
you sold your Leica? But you loved that thing.
what about your Europe photo tour, the chateaus?
chateaus have been there for 300 years.
Mieke's gone in 1 2 hours.
let's go! Frommer's says check in three hours before international flights.
come here, guidebook!
Whoo! We're going to Rome. We're going to Rome!

all right, summer at sea group.
our tour begins in the Vatican museum.
this way, please.
there it is.
this entrance is for private tour groups only.
Oh... but we are a private tour group.
we've come all the way from America.
that guy in the orange jacket is mentally retarded.
Si, I can tell. How very, very sad.
Yes, it is.
but if you are a tour, where is your guide?
we've got a fantastic tour guide.
right here. - What? No...
the Vatican has been used as a papal residence ever since the time of Constantine the Great of the 5th century A. D!
Oh.
OK... um... if you'll all follow me, please.
have a very special day for a very special little man.
OK.
I can't believe that guy let us in.
what a retard!
let's find Mieke. - Scusate.
one of our English-speaking tour guides has called in sick.
could you please take these peoples also?
how big is Vatican City? -. 5 square kilometers.
who built the colonnades? - Gianlorenzo Bernini, 1 656.
where are the bathrooms? - Floors 2, 6 and 7.
next I'll take you to where the College of Cardinals elects a new pope.
when this happens, white smoke is sent up from the Vatican.
here's a fun fact... - Mieke must be around here somewhere.
let's go.
behind me is the appartamento papale, or "papal apartment." We're obviously not permitted.
excuse me, miss. What is this?
that is the bell of San Marco.
when the pope dies, the Cardinal Vicar of Rome rings this bell to notify the people of Rome.
next we will view the Sistine Chapel. Follow me, please.
come on. I think I hear them.
which way did they go?
that way. I'd stake my reputation on it.
good enough for me.
Hey, check it out! I wonder what this does.
it doesn't do anything, it's a rope. Come on, let's go.
they got a lot of old stuff here.
Dio mio!
the bell of San Marco!
the pope is dead!
she's not in here.
let's go. We're definitely not supposed to be in here.
Hey, check this out!
I'm the pope! - Cooper...
take off the pope hat.
Oh, no. It's OK. I'm catholic. - Take it off, goddamnit!
Oh, you took the Lord's name in vain!
only I can forgive you now, my son.
take that fudging thing off!
the pope breaks an open-field tackle.
it's a Hail Mary, he catches at the 40...
touchdown, Pope!
the pope makes a two-point conversion.
and oh, my Lord! It's the Pope, eight, and the heathens, nothing!
how's you, sucka?
Cooper, the hat! The hat!
the hat is on fire!
we don't need no water let the m...
I'm not kidding! Look!
Oh, holy shit!
I don't want this!
fireplace! Fireplace! Go, go!
white smoke!
they've elected the new pope!
I'm coming to you live from Vatican Square where the College of Cardinals, in a surprise move, has just elected a new pope. The crowd is very excited.
this is so strange.
usually they wait 1 5 days to elect a new pope.
we could be seeing history in the making!
we could be seeing an arrest in the making.
there she is. Mieke!
Hey! Stupid curtain!
let me out!
Mieke!
it's the new pope!
what the hell...?
Mieke!
hold on!
this is one crazy pope.
you!
Ferma! Stop! You!
you... and your retarded friend, you're in big, big trouble.
take your mitts off them boys!
they're with me!
I've just about had enough of you fuckin' ities!
but I am Swiss!
them, too!
now, bud...
you get in there, and you say what you got to say.
Mieke. I'm here.
I made it.
who are you?
what a fucking loser! I'm gonna videotape this.
I'm Scott.
from Ohio?
Scott? Scott Thomas?
Yes. - From Ohio?
what are you doing in Rome? - I came here to be with you.
listen, I just traveled all the way across Europe.
I got chased by naked men.
I ate brownies with absolutely no drugs in them.
I watched a brother and sister make out.
I kicked a robot in the balls, but I did it all so that...
so I could tell you one thing.
I love you, Mieke.
we're perfect for each other. What do you think?
I think...
Oh, Mike... Mieke!
forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.
I have cheated on my husband.
do you think God will ever forgive me?
Oh, yes!
father?
this sucks.
I can't believe I'm the only one who didn't hook up while we were here.
europe is officially the worst country on Earth.
I know.
I thought I'd at least get to have some crazy European sex.
what?
Scott, I have to go. - OK.
my boat is leaving.
I still can't believe you came all the way here, just for me.
what can I say? I'm very unpredictable.
keep writing to me, Scott, OK?
Yeah, I will.
go. - Bye.
Yes! Yes! Yes!
Hey, guys, I'm so glad we got to take this trip together.
this was the best time of my life.
excuse me.
you're the young man who gave me that tour of the Vatican, aren't you?
listen, I'm very sorry... - I just wanted to thank you.
you were the most knowledgeable, albeit idiosyncratic, tour guide I've ever had.
Thanks.
but I'm not actually a tour guide.
I've just read Frommer's enough to have it memorized.
although I threw in a few things Frommer's didn't know about.
how would you like to add them?
excuse me?
that's my guidebook.
I'm Arthur Frommer.
it's amazing!
Frommer's is going to pay me to see every museum and cathedral in Europe.
that sounds so exciting...
for you.
I figured, since you're going to be staying, you might need this.
a disposable camera. - That's right.
Thanks, Scotty.
that's from both of us.
Hello, Mr. Walters.
I see.
fired? Well, l...
well, if that's what you want, I understand. I just...
goodbye, sir.
they had to catch you eventually, right?
no, they fired Humphrey. - Shut up!
I got his office and a raise.
No!
flight 341 from Rome to Cleveland...
that's you guys.
have a good flight, everybody. - Come here.
be good.
Oh! OK...
Cooper, have a good flight. - Be good.
Thanks.
I'm on it.
this still counts as Europe, right?
dear Mieke, "Greece sounds incredible.
I just moved into my dorm room today, "but I can't wait to see you over Christmas break.
this time I think I'll fly to Berlin direct.
Hello? - Hey, buddy, how's college?
I just got here. My roommate hasn't even showed up yet.
do they room all you pre-med geeks together?
I'm not sure I'm going pre-med.
I'm thinking about majoring in German.
German? I've got a better idea.
why don't you major in not being such a woman?
so, how's Jenny?
Jenny... Jenny who?
I know a lot of ladies named Jenny, they're all...
Hey, Scotty, what's up?
Hi, Jenny!
how's Jamie doing with Frommer?
Oh, no.
hold on.
come here, robot!
Cooper, not again!
hold on, this could be my new roommate.
what's the freak look like?
is he a dork or is he cool? Better not be cooler than me.
is he bigger than me?
I just got your last email. What are you doing here?
going to college.
you're going to college here?
what dorm? - This one.
room 21 4.

I guess they thought I was a guy.

is anyone there? - Yes, what do you see?
iceberg, right ahead! -Thank you.
iceberg, right ahead!
hard to starboard!
turn! Smartly!
full astern!
hard over. - Helm's hard over, sir.
go, lads, go!
bring that steam down! Bring it down!
shut all the dampers! Shut them!
hold it.
now! Engage the reversing engine.
why ain't they turning?
is it hard over? - It is. Yes, sir, hard over.
come on. Come on. Turn.
Yes.
it's gonna hit!
Jesus Christ!
Jesus.
hard to port! - Hard to port!
get back!
come on, let's go!
get out of the door. They're closing the doors!
get out!
get out of the door! Go!
come on, lads! Go, lads, go!
out!
Oh, my God.
that was a close shave, wasn't it?
smell ice, can you? Bleeding Christ!
note the time and enter it in the log.
what was that, Mr. Murdoch?
an iceberg, sir.
I put her hard to starboard, and ran the engines full astern, but it was too close.
I tried to port round it, but she hit.
close the watertight doors. - Doors are closed, sir.
all stop. -Aye, sir.
find the carpenter. Get him to sound the ship.
Yes, sir.
come on, let's get the hell out of here.
come on, hurry up.
excuse me, why have the engines stopped?
I felt a shudder. - I shouldn't worry, madam.
we've likely thrown a propeller blade. That's the shudder you felt.
may I bring you anything?
no, thank you.
so, now there's talk of an iceberg. Did you see anything?
I don't see anything now. Do you?
if this is the direction the rats are going, that's good enough for me.
everything's under control.
you there. - Sir, there is no emergency.
Yes, there is. I've been robbed.
get the master-at-arms.
now, you moron! - Yes, sir.
Hey, did I miss the fun?
did you see what happened? - No, I missed it.
apparently, it hit over there.
boiler Room 6 is flooded 8 feet above the plate...
and the mail hold is worse. She's all buckled in...
can you shore up? - Not unless the pumps get ahead.
have you seen the damage in the mail hold?
no, she's already underwater.
this is bad.
we should tell mother and Cal.
I think they're very good, sir.
don't touch anything. I want the entire room photographed.
we've been looking for you, Miss.
here we go.
something serious has happened.
Yes, it has.
indeed.
two things dear to me have disappeared this evening.
now that one is back, I have a pretty good idea where to find the other.
search him.
take your coat off, son. -Now what?
come on, now.
Cal, what are you doing?
we're in the middle of an emergency. What's going on?
is this it? -That's it.
this is horseshit!
don't you believe it, Rose. Don't.
he couldn't have. - Of course he could.
it's easy enough for a professional.
but I was with him the whole time. This is absurd.
perhaps he did it while you were putting your clothes back on, dear.
real slick, Cal. Rose, they put it in my pocket.
shut up. -It isn't even your pocket. Is it, son?
property of A. L. Ryerson.
that was reported stolen today.
I just borrowed it. I was gonna return it.
an honest thief. We have an honest thief here, do we?
you know I didn't do this, Rose. You know it.
don't believe them, Rose. You know it.
you know I didn't do it. -Come on, son. Let's go.
Rose! -Come on, there's a good lad.
come on.
you know I didn't do it. You know me!
this is most unfortunate, Captain.
water 14 feet above the keel in 10 minutes in the forepeak, in all three holds, and in Boiler Room 6.
that's right, sir. -When can we get underway, damn it?
that's five compartments.
she can stay a float with the first four compartments breached...
but not five.
not five.
as she goes down by the head the water will spill over the tops of the bulkheads at E deck from one to the next, back and back.
there's no stopping it.
the pumps. We open the pumps...
the pumps buy you time, but minutes only.
from this moment, no matter what we do...
titanic will founder.
but this ship can't sink.
she's made of iron, sir. I assure you, she can. And she will.
it is a mathematical certainty.
how much time?
an hour. Two, at most.
and how many aboard, Mr. Murdoch?
2, 200 souls on board, sir.
well, I believe you may get your headlines, Mr. Ismay.
Oh, it is a little slut, isn't it?
you look at me when I'm talking to you!
Mr. Hockley? -Not now. We're busy.
sir, I've been told to ask you to put on your lifebelts...
and come up to the boat deck. - I said, not now.
I'm sorry to inconvenience you, Mr. Hockley, but it's Captain's orders.
now please, dress warmly.
it's quite cold out tonight.
now, may I suggest topcoats and hats?
this is ridiculous.
not to worry, Miss. I'm sure it's just a precaution.
everybody up. Lifebelts on.
what's he on about?
everybody up. Put your lifebelts on. -What's the ruckus?
just put your lifebelts on.
sir?
that's right, CQD, the distress call.
that's our position.
tell whoever responds that we're going down by the head...
and need immediate assistance.
blimey.
keep lowering!
steady! Make it taut! And winch out!
uncover this boat! Uncover all the boats aft!
release those ties!
roll back that cover! Smartly now!
Mr. Wilde, where are the passengers?
they've all gone back inside. Too damn cold and noisy for them.
you there!
get down here and help with these lines!
care for a drink, sir?
please put your lifebelts on.
Sonny, what's doing?
you got us all trussed up here and now we're cooling our heels.
sorry, ma'am. Let me go find out.
I don't think anybody knows what the hell's going on around here.
it's just the goddamned English, doing everything by the book.
there's no need for language, Mr. Hockley.
go back and turn the heaters on in our rooms.
I'd like a cup of tea when I return.
Yes, ma'am. -Yes, ma'am.
Mr. Andrews...
I saw the iceberg. And I see it in your eyes.
please tell me the truth.
the ship will sink.
you're certain? -Yes.
in an hour or so...
all this will be at the bottom of the Atlantic.
what?
please, tell only who you must.
I don't want to be responsible for a panic.
and get to a boat. Quickly. Don't wait.
you remember what I told you about the boats?
Yes.
I understand.
Yes, madam, please put it on immediately.
over here, son.
sir, they need you up at the second-class purser's office.
there's a big mob up there. -Go on. I'll keep an eye on him.
Aye. Right.
sir!
carpathia says they're making 17 knots.
full steam for them, sir.
she's the only one who's responding?
the only one close, sir.
says they can be here in four hours.
four hours!
thank you, Bride.
my God.
we are swung out and ready, sir.
hadn't we better get the women and children into the boats, sir?
Yes.
sir?
women and children first, yes.
Yes, sir.
ladies and gentlemen, your attention, please!
step this way, please. That's right.
come towards me. Thank you.
good.
for the time being, I shall require only women and children.
gentlemen, please. -Right here.
all right, boys. Like the Captain said, nice and cheery, so there's no panic.
wedding Dance.
lifebelts on. Put your lifebelts on.
here, put your lifebelt on.
Yeah, come on. Put your lifebelt on.
turn that around.
please.
it isn't time to go up to the boats yet!
please stay calm.
make sure, everybody, you've got your lifebelts on.
and, gentlemen, allow the women and children through to the front.
what are we doing, Mommy? -We're just waiting, dear.
when they finish putting first-class people in the boats they will be starting with us and we'll want to be all ready, won't we?
everybody, not just right yet.
don't push on the gates. You won't get out any faster.
someone help. -Go and get some help.
lower it away, left and right together!
both sides together! Steady!
steady!
stop!
hold the left side!
right side only!
right side only. Hold the left side!
lower away together!
steady, lads!
you know, I do believe this ship may sink.
I've been asked to give you this small token of our appreciation.
compliments of Mr. Caledon Hockley.
come on, sister. You heard the man. Into the boat.
any room for a gentleman, gentlemen?
will the lifeboats be seated according to class?
I hope they're not too crowded.
don't you understand?
the water is freezing and there aren't enough boats.
not enough by half.
half the people on this ship are going to die.
not the better half.
come on, Ruth, get in the boat. First-class seats are right up here.
you know, it's a pity I didn't keep that drawing.
it'll be worth a lot more by morning.
women and children towards the front, please.
you unimaginable bastard.
come on, Rose, darling. There's plenty of room for you.
right this way, Miss.
come on, Rose.
you're next, darling.
come into the boat, Rose.
come.
rose?
get into the boat.
rose?
rose?
rose, come back here. - Where are you going?
to him?
what, to be a whore to a gutter rat?
no, wait.
I'd rather be his whore than your wife.
No!
I said, no!
rose, please stop!
lower away! - No, stop!
all together. - No, wait!
lower away!
Rose!
help!
can anybody hear me?
Hello! Help me!
Mr. Andrews!
steward, check the starboard corridor. - Yes, Mr. Andrews.
madam, please, put on a lifebelt. Get to the boat deck immediately.
Lucy, for God's sake, put on a lifebelt and set a good example.
Yes, sir.
anyone in here? - Mr. Andrews?
thank God.
where would the master-at-arms take someone under arrest?
you have to get to a boat right away. - No!
I'm doing this with or without your help, sir.
but without will take longer.
take the elevator to the very bottom. Go to the left.
down the crewmen's passage, then go right and left again at the stairs.
you'll come to a long corridor.
this could be bad.
Oh, shit!
excuse me. Thank you.
I do not care what you think, sir. - Lifts are closed.
I'm sorry, miss, but the lifts are closed.
I'm through being polite, God damn it! Now, take me down!
e deck.
come on.
I'm going back up. -No.
come back! I'm going back up!
crew passage.
Jack!
Rose!
Jack!
rose, I'm in here!
Jack!
Jack! - Rose!
Jack! Jack, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
that guy, Lovejoy, put it in my pocket. - I know. I know.
listen, Rose...
you're gonna have to find a spare key, all right?
look in that cabinet right there.
it's a little silver one, Rose.
silver.
these are all brass ones!
check right here, Rose.
rose...
how'd you find out I didn't do it?
I didn't. I just realized I already knew.
keep looking.
no key. There's no key!
all right, Rose, listen.
you're gonna have to go find some help.
it'll be all right.
I'll be right back.
I'll just wait here!
Hello? Is there anyone here?
Hello?
is there anybody down here?
we need help! Hello?
damn it.
can anybody hear me, please? Hello?
Oh, thank God.
wait, I need your help. There's a man back here.
wait!
miss, you shouldn't be here now.
I need your help. -We'll get you topside. This way, quickly.
there's a man down here. He's trapped.
this way. There is no need to panic. -Please!
no, I'm not panicking! You're going the wrong way!
let go of me! Listen!
the hell with you.
Oh, my God.
Jack!
Rose!
will this work?
I guess we'll find out. Come on.
wait.
try a couple of practice swings over there.
good. Now try to hit the same mark again, Rose. You can do it.
okay. That's enough practice.
come on, Rose. You can do it.
listen, just hit it really hard and really fast.
come on. Wait.
open your hands up a little more.
good. -Like that?
right.
listen, Rose, I trust you.
go.
you did it!
come on, let's go.
Oh, shit, this is cold!
this is the way out.
we have to find another way. Come on.
now there's something you don't see every day.
what's this luggage doing here? Get rid of it. We need the room.
get rid of that! Out!
come. Time for her to go, sir. Step back.
keep calm. Sit down. -No.
No! -Make more room.
that's right. Look sharp.
Lovejoy.
he's not on the starboard side, either.
we're running out of time.
this strutting martinet isn't letting any men on at all.
there's one on the other side letting men on.
then that's our play.
we'll need some insurance first. Come on.
come on, this way, please. All the way down there.
here!
what do you think you're doing?
you'll have to pay for that, you know.
that's White Star Line property. -Shut up!
will you hold the boat a moment? I just have to run back to my room...
sit down. -She's the last.
Mr. Lightoller, why are the boats being launched half-full?
not now, Mr. Andrews. -There, look.
twenty or so in a boat built for 65?
and I saw one boat with only twelve. Twelve!
we weren't sure of the weight, Mr. Andrews.
these boats may buckle. -Rubbish!
they were tested in Belfast with the weight of 70 men.
now fill these boats, Mr. Lightoller. For God's sake, man!
please, I need more women and children!
get back in there! This is not an exit.
get back in there.
you can't keep us locked in here like animals. The ship's bloody sinking.
bring forward the women.
unlock the gates.
women only!
lock the gates!
for God's sake, man, there are women and children down here!
let us up, so we can have a chance!
get back!
Jack. -Tommy.
can we get out? -It's hopeless that way.
whatever we do, we've got to do it fast.
Jack!
Fabrizio.
the boats are all gone.
this whole place is flooding. We've got to get out.
there is niente this way. -All right.
let's go this way, all right? Come on.
I make my own luck. -So do I.
come on!
no, come on, let's go this way.
this way.
just go back to the main stairwell and everything will be sorted out there.
the hell it will.
it will all get sorted out back there. Go back to the main stairwell.
open the gate. -Go back down the main stairwell.
open the gate right now.
go back down the main stairwell like I told you!
God damn it! Son of a bitch!
stop that!
open the damn gate!
Fabri, Tommy, give me hand here.
move aside. Move aside! -Pull!
pull!
move aside. -Put that down!
move aside! -Put that down!
one! Two! -Stop that!
three!
again!
let's go!
let's go, Rose.
you can't go up there! You can't do this!
keep order here!
get back. Get back!
hold on to her!
pull her in.
get back, I say...
or I'll shoot you all like dogs!
keep order here!
keep order, I say.
Mr. Lowe, man this boat.
right.
is everybody all right? Nobody panic.
stay back!
we're too late.
there are more boats down the front.
stay with this one. Murdoch. He seems to be quite practical.
stop lowering!
stop lowering!
cut the falls!
sit down!
stay back, you lot! Just stay back!
stay back, the lot of you! Just stay back!
it's starting to fall apart. We don't have much time.
Mr. Murdoch?
Mr. Hockley. You two, with me, now!
I'm a businessman, as you know, I have a business proposition for you.
come on, Rose.
the boats are gone!
Colonel, are there any boats on that side?
no, Miss, but there are a couple of boats all the way forward.
this way, I'll lead you.
what's the use? Nobody's listening to us anyway.
they don't listen to us at dinner, either. Come on, let's play. Keep us warm.
Orpheus.
music to drown by. Now I know I'm in first class.
where is everyone? -They're all still aft, sir.
come on, madam, don't cry.
we have an understanding, then, Mr. Murdoch.
will the men please hold back? Hold back, I say!
women and children only! Get back!
I said, step back, sir. Come through, madam.
this way. Step back, sir!
let the women...
you better check the other side. Go!
I found her, on the other side. Waiting for a boat with him.
any more women and children? -They're all aboard, Mr. Murdoch.
anyone else then?
hop on, sir. -Anyone else?
do hurry. Hurry along.
stand by the falls.
God damn it all to hell.
shit.
fire!
sir, you can't go through here.
sir, you can't go through.
that's it. Splendid. Right.
prepare to lower!
ready on the left!
take them down.
keep it steady.
both sides together. Steady. Keep it steady.
give her to me. -Daddy.
it'll be fine, darling. Don't you worry. -Take her.
daddy, get in the boat.
it's goodbye for a little while. Only for a little while.
there'll be another boat for the daddies...
this boat's for the mommies and the children.
you hold Mommy's hand and be a good little girl.
I'm not going without you.
no. You have to go, now. -No, Jack.
get in the boat, Rose.
no, Jack.
Yes. Get on the boat.
Yes, get on the boat, Rose.
my God. Look at you. You look a fright.
here.
put this on. Come on.
go on. I'll get the next one.
no, not without you.
I'll be all right. Listen, I'll be fine.
I'm a survivor, all right? Don't worry about me.
now, go on. Get on.
I have an arrangement with an officer on the other side of the ship.
Jack and I can get off safely. Both of us.
see? I got my own boat to catch.
go. - Come on, hurry. They're almost full.
step aboard, Miss.
go. - Come on, hurry.
step aboard, please. -You're Daddy's good girl.
step lively! -Keep back.
keep back, I say.
clear the rail, please.
lower away!
steady.
and lower away evenly, lads.
easy.
lower away.
you're a good liar.
almost as good as you.
easy, now. And lower away.
there's no... There's no arrangement, is there?
no, there is.
not that you'll benefit much from it.
and even away.
I always win, Jack.
and lower away evenly, lads.
one way or another.
watch that trim. Trim that boat.
easy.
even, lads.
keep going!
keep going!
Rose!
stop her! - Rose!
what are you doing? -Stop her!
No!
Rose!
you're so stupid! Why did you do that?
you're so stupid, Rose.
why did you do that? Why?
you jump, I jump, right?
right.
I couldn't go. I couldn't go, Jack.
it's all right. We'll think of something.
at least I'm with you.
come on! Move!
come on!
come on! Move!
come on!
move!
come on, come on, Rose!
rose, come on!
move, Rose!
go!
I hope you enjoy your time together!
what could possibly be funny?
I put the diamond in the coat.
and I put the coat on her!
come on.
dada!
we can't leave him.
all right, come on!
dada!
go back!
that's the wrong way! Come back!
go!
go!
run, Rose!
Jack!
Jack! -Rose!
this way!
come on!
give me your hand!
Oh, God!
help!
help!
wait, sir! Sir, open the gate, please!
please! -Please, help us!
please! -Please!
bloody hell!
hurry.
come on, come on! -Come on!
go, go!
Jesus.
please! - Come on!
Hurry!
come on!
I'm sorry, I dropped the keys.
wait, please! -Wait!
don't leave! Please, send for help!
I got it! Which one is it, Rose?
the short one. Try the short one.
hurry, Jack.
Oh, no! No, it won't go in.
hurry, Jack.
it's stuck! It's stuck!
come on! -Hurry, Jack!
hurry, Jack!
I got it! Go, Rose!
go!
Jack!
come on!
move, move.
get those oars in place. - Get an oar under it.
women and children only, damn you!
hold it!
get these davits cranked in! Let's get the falls hooked up!
stay back!
mommy!
stay back, I say.
keep going up!
stop pushing!
stay back!
will you give us a chance to live, you limey bastard?
I'll shoot any man who tries to get past me! Get back!
bastard!
get back!
we had a deal, damn it!
your money can't save you anymore than it can save me. Get back!
women and children only!
stop pushing!
no, Tommy!
No! No, Tommy!
bastardo!
no, Will!
now stand back, damn you!
gently, hold it.
I have a child!
clear a path!
please, I have a child.
please, I'm all she has in the world.
go on.
step back!
please!
here. Give her to me.
there, there.
wait! Mr. Andrews.
Oh, Rose.
won't you even make a try for it?
I'm sorry that I didn't build you a stronger ship, young Rose.
it's going fast. We have to move.
wait.
good luck to you, Rose.
and to you.
Mr. Guggenheim? These are for you.
no, thank you. We are dressed in our best...
and are prepared to go down as gentlemen.
but we would like a brandy.
get the falls over here!
make them taut. Then we'll right it!
captain, where should I go? Please.
captain. Sir.
right. That's it, then.
goodbye, Wally, good luck.
goodbye, Wallace. -So long, old chap.
and so they lived happily together for 300 years in the land of eternal youth and beauty.
there's no time! Cut the falls!
cut them if you have to!
I need a knife!
cut the falls now! Cut them loose!
cut those bloody falls!
gentlemen, it has been a privilege playing with you tonight.
we have to stay on the ship as long as possible.
come on.
this way. Hold the rail.
come on, Rose. Jump.
come on.
I got you. Jump!
I've got you, Miss.
Jack! - What?
back!
no, you'll swamp us!
nobody panic.
Yeah, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death...
you want to walk a little faster through that valley, there?
holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us, sinners now and at the hour of our death. Amen.
hail Mary, full of grace...
this way.
come on!
and I saw a new heaven and a new earth.
for the first heaven and the first Earth had passed away...
and there was no more sea.
it'll be over soon. It'll all be over soon.
and he shall dwell with them...
and they shall be his people...
and God himself shall be with them and be their God.
Jack...
this is where we first met.
and God shall wipe away all the tears from their eyes...
and there shall be no more death...
neither shall there be sorrow or crying...
neither shall there be any more pain...
for the former world has passed away.
bloody pull faster! And pull!
hang on, Miss Trudy!
hold on real tight.
God almighty!
keep those breakers in! Keep them in!
we have to move!
give me your hand, I'll pull you over.
come on, give me your hand.
I've got you. I won't let go.
come on, I've got you.
what's happening, Jack? - I don't know.
hold on! - Jack!
somebody help me, please!
this is it!
Oh, my God, Jack!
hold on!
take a deep breath when I say.
kick for the surface and keep kicking.
do not let go of my hand.
we're going to make it, Rose. Trust me.
I trust you.
ready? Now!
Jack!
Rose! - Jack!
Jack!
get off her!
Rose! - Jack!
swim, Rose! I need you to swim!
keep swimming.
it's so cold. - Swim, Rose!
come on. Here.
keep swimming. Come on.
here, get on it.
get on top.
come on, Rose.
stay on it. Stay on, Rose.
it'll be all right now.
you'll be all right now.
return the boats!
the boats are coming back for us, Rose.
hold on just a little bit longer.
they had to row away for the suction...
but now they'll be coming back.
for God's sake!
please help us!
you don't understand.
if we go back, they'll swamp the boat. They'll pull us right down, I'm telling you.
knock it off. You're scaring me.
come on, girls, grab an oar. Let's go.
are you out of your mind? We're in the middle of the North Atlantic.
now, do you people want to live or do you want to die?
I don't understand a one of you.
what's the matter with you? It's your men out there!
there's plenty of room for more.
and there'll be one less on this boat.
if you don't shut that hole in your face!
bring in your oars over there.
tie these two boats together as well.
now, make sure that's tied up nice and tight.
right, listen to me, men. We have to go back.
I want to transfer all the women from this boat into that boat right now.
as quick as you can, please.
let's create some space over there. Move forward and out.
it's getting quiet.
it's just going to take a couple of minutes to get the boats organized.
I don't know about you...
but I intend to write a strongly-worded letter...
to the White Star Line about all this.
I love you, Jack.
don't you do that.
don't you say your goodbyes.
not yet. Do you understand me?
I'm so cold.
listen, Rose...
you're gonna get out of here.
you're gonna go on...
and you're gonna make lots of babies.
and you're gonna watch them grow.
you're gonna die an old lady, warm in her bed.
not here.
not this night.
not like this. Do you understand me?
I can't feel my body.
winning that ticket was the best thing that ever happened to me.
it brought me to you.
and I'm thankful for that, Rose.
I'm thankful.
you must...
do me this honor.
you must promise me that you'll survive.
no matter what happens.
no matter how hopeless.
promise me now, Rose.
I promise.
never let go.
I'll never let go, Jack.
I'll never let go.
right ahead, sir.
oars!
do you see any moving?
no, sir. None moving, sir.
check them.
bring that oar up here.
check them. Make sure.
these are dead, sir.
now give way. Ahead easy.
careful with your oars. Don't hit them.
is there anyone alive out there?
can anyone hear me?
is there anyone alive out there?
we waited too long.
keep checking them! Keep looking!
is there anyone alive out there?
can anyone hear me?
in my flying machine.
up she goes.
come, Josephine.
in my flying machine.
Jack?
there's a boat.
Jack?
there's a boat, Jack.
come back.
come back!
Hello!
can anyone hear me?
there's nothing here, sir.
come back.
I'll never let go. I promise.
come about!
fifteen hundred people went into the sea when Titanic sank from under us.
there were 20 boats floating nearby...
and only one came back.
one.
six were saved from the water...
myself included.
six out of 1, 500.
afterward, the 700 people in the boats had nothing to do but wait.
wait to die, wait to live.
wait for an absolution that would never come.
sir, I don't think you'll find any of your people down here.
it's all steerage.
his hair is reddish brown, and a white beard.
isn't there another passenger list? - There's no other list.
perhaps he's on another ship. -We're doing all we can.
that's the last time I ever saw him.
he married, of course, and inherited his millions.
but the crash of '29 hit his interests hard.
and he put a pistol in his mouth that year.
or so I read.
can I take your name, please, love?
Dawson.
rose Dawson.
thank you.
we never found anything on Jack. There's no record of him at all.
no, there wouldn't be, would there?
and I've never spoken of him until now. Not to anyone.
not even your grandfather.
a woman's heart is a deep ocean of secrets.
but now you know there was a man named Jack Dawson and that he saved me in every way that a person can be saved.
I don't even have a picture of him.
he exists now only in my memory.
Keldysh, Mir-2 on our way to the surface.
I was saving this for when I found the diamond.
I'm sorry.
three years.
I've thought of nothing except Titanic.
but I never got it.
I never let it in.
come to Los Angeles.
the sun shines bright.
the beaches are wide and inviting.
and the orange groves stretch as far as the eye can see.
there are jobs aplenty.
land is cheap.
every workingman can have his own house.
and inside every house, a happy all-American family.
you can have all this.
and who knows?
you could even be discovered become a movie star, or at least see one.
life is good in Los Angeles.
it's paradise on earth.
that's what they tell you, anyway.
because they're selling an image.
they're selling it through movies, radio and television.
in the hit show, Badge of Honor, the L. A. cops walk on water as they keep the city clean of crooks.
you'd think this place was the Garden of Eden.
but there's trouble in paradise and his name is Meyer Harris Cohen,
Mickey C, to his fans.
local L. A. color to the nth degree.
and his number one bodyguard
Johnny Stompanato.
Mickey C's the head of organized crime in these parts.
he runs dope, rackets and prostitution.
he kills a dozen people a year.
and the dapper little gent does it in style.
and every time his picture's on the front page it's a black eye for the image of Los Angeles.
because how can organized crime exist in the city with the best police force in the world?
something has to be done.
but nothing too original, because, hey, this is Hollywood.
what worked for Al Capone would work for the Mickster.
Mr. Cohen, you're under arrest.
nonpayment of federal income tax.
but all is not well.
sending Mickey up has created a vacuum.
and it's only a matter of time before someone with balls of brass tries to fill it.
remember, dear readers you heard it here first off the record on the q. t and very Hush-Hush.
you're like Santa Claus with that list.
except everyone on it's been naughty.
guy's been out of Q two weeks.
leave it for later.
we've got to pick up the booze and get it to the station.
Hollywood, this is 6-Adam-7.
have Central send a prowler to 4216 Evergreen.
parole violation: assault arising from a family dispute.
we won't be here. They'll see him.
quit whining!
quit whining all the time! It makes me sick!
shut up!
who the hell are you?
the ghost of Christmas past.
dance with a man for a change?
what are you, a smart ass?
I'll get cozy with your parole officer.
you touch her again,
I'll have you violated on a kiddies rapper beef.
you know what they do to kiddies rappers in Quentin.
you have someplace you can go?
go get yourself fixed up.
merry Christmas.
merry Christmas, ma'am. -Let's go, Bud.
the guys will be waiting.
what do you do on Badge of Honor?
I'm the technical advisor.
I teach Brett Chase how to walk and talk like a cop.
Brett Chase doesn't walk and talk like you.
that's because he's the television version.
america isn't ready for the real me.
is it true you're the one who arrested Bob Mitchum?
badge of Honor guys pretend.
but being the real thing must be a thrill.
why don't we go someplace quiet?
I'll give you the lowdown on Mitchum.
big V. Jack Vincennes.
may I have this dance? -Of course.
this is Sid Hudgens with Hush-Hush magazine.
Hello, Karen.
hello yourself.
what's that about?
we did a piece,Ingenue Dikes in Hollywood.
her name got mentioned.
Jackie-boy a friend just sold some reefer to Matt Reynolds.
he's tripping the light fantastic with Tammy Jordan.
sorry, I lost you for a second, Sid.
contract players, Metro.
you pinch them, I do a nice feature next issue.
plus the usual $50 cash.
no, I need another $50.
two $20's for two patrolmen, a dime for the Hollywood Station watch commander.
Jackie, it's Christmas.
no, it's not. It's felony possession of marijuana.
actually, it's circulation 36, 000 and climbing.
there's no telling where this will go.
radio, television.
once you whet the public's appetite for the truth, the sky's the limit.
sergeant Ed Exley, son of the legendary Preston Exley.
must be a hard act to follow.
why not make a mark somewhere else?
why become a cop, Ed?
I like to help people.
we heard 2 officers were assaulted this evening.
what do you think about that?
goes with the job.
I took the report.
luckily, they're okay.
aren't you young to be watch commander?
it's only tonight.
the married men have Christmas Eve off.
that's a good lead for the story.
merry Christmas, Captain.
captain Smith. -Drop the formalities, Bobby.
it's Christmas
Eve, call me Dudley.
I came up with a title for the story.
I'm calling it "Silent Night with the LAPD " .
that's grand.
now remember, Bobby, that's "Smith " .
with an "S.
thank you, gentlemen.
merry Christmas.
hold on there, lads.
merry Christmas.
I saw the test results on the lieutenant's exam.
first out of 23.
what'll it be, then?
patrol Division? Internal Affairs? What?
I was thinking Detective Bureau.
Edmund you're a political animal.
you have the eye for human weakness, but not the stomach.
you're wrong, sir.
would you be willing to plant evidence on a suspect you knew to be guilty in order to insure an indictment?
we've been over this.
yes or no?
no.
would you beat a confession out of a suspect you knew to be guilty?
no.
would you shoot a hardened criminal in the back in order to offset the chance that some lawyer
no.
then for the love of God don't be a detective.
work where you don't have to make those kind of choices.
dudley, I know you mean well but I don't need to do it the way you did or my father.
at least get rid of the glasses.
I can't think of a man on the Bureau who wears them.
if I get held up, you guys better be here.
Hi, Nick.
I need a delivery.
a case each of gin, rum, Scotch.
sounds like a hell of a party.
be right with you.
merry Christmas.
merry Christmas to you, officer.
that obvious?
it's practically stamped on your forehead.
there you go.
see what he wants, Buzz.
get lost, why don't you?
down! Get your fucking head down.
I got a license for that.
cut me some slack. I used to be a cop.
Leland Meeks. Never heard of you.
they call me Buzz.
I don't give a rat's ass what they call you.
keep your head down.
and stay there,Buzz.
you okay?
she's fine.
I'm not asking you, sir.
somebody hit you?
it's not what you think.
what is it, then?
you got the wrong idea, mister. I'm fine.
but it's nice to know you care.
drive safely.
what's going on?
you know him?
Yeah, I've seen him around.
he used to be a cop.
they're sitting in the dark, goofing on the Christmas tree.
put your camera right there.
when I walk out, I'll stop here.
get the movie premiere in the background.
I like it.
the Movie Premiere Pot Bust.
when I walk out, I don't want your floodlights in my eyes.
consider it done. You hear that, Chip?
come on.
go! Pop them!
Freeze! Police!
come on. Come on, let's go.
my family's coming in
it'll be a nice Christmas gift.
Hi, Tammy.
Hi, Matt.
right over here.
just turn. -Hold it. Got it!
the Movie Premiere Pot Bust!
take them in.
I'll get the evidence.
it's Christmas Eve in the City of Angels and while decent citizens sleep the sleep of the righteous hopheads prowl for marijuana not knowing that a man is coming to stop them:
celebrity crime-stopper, Jack Vincennes.
scourge of grasshoppers and dope fiends everywhere.
you like it?
Yeah, subtle.
what took you?
my partner stopped to help a damsel in distress.
his priorities are all screwed up.
up to your old tricks again, Bud?
Hollywood Jack, what brings you to our humble station house?
how are you? -Why are you here?
you know me. Keeping the streets safe.
take these two, get them dressed and book them.
the party's upstairs.
okay, I'll be right up.
what's that for?
you are watch commander tonight, aren't you?
Yeah. So?
a gratuity from Hush-Hush magazine.
buy yourself some new loafers.
no thanks, Jack. You keep your payoff.
I'm not interested.
what the hell is this?
six spics. Mexicans, sir. The ones who assaulted Brown and Helenowski.
I heard Helenowski bled 6 pints and Brown's in a coma.
they have bruises and muscle pulls.
it's not what I heard.
get them into lock up.
Stens, you guys hear what those taco benders did to Helenowski and Brown?
Helenowski lost an eye, and they're reading Brown his last rites.
that ought to make for a very merry Christmas for them.
Hey, guys.
guys. They brought the Mexicans in.
they're downstairs.
let's do it.
come on, guys. Let's get them.
Stensland, the party's upstairs.
this doesn't concern you.
come on, guys. Haven't you got work?
go back to the party.
come on, it's Christmas, help me out.
move it!
I just got a few more questions.
you don't have to be here.
go!
you better put a leash on your partner before he kills somebody.
teach him a lesson!
get him, Stens!
this is for ours, Poncho.
get him, Stens!
let me through!
No! He didn't do nothing!
what are you looking at?
tell that Mexican to shut up!
you're sick!
don't break it up. Get back! Get back!
Yeah, and fuck your mother!
fuck you!
stop, officer! That's an order!
you'll all be in my report!
bloody Christmas.
the press love to label.
you should know this is bigger than the police board.
the grand jury's convening.
indictments may be handed down.
will you testify?
no, sir. I won't.
district Attorney Loew?
you and officer Stensland brought the liquor to the station.
Stensland was already drunk.
appearing as a voluntary witness against him could offset damage to yourself.
I won't testify against him, or anyone else.
this man is a disgrace.
your badge and gun, officer.
you're suspended from duty.
dismissed.
we need police witnesses to offset the damage done to the Department.
justice has to be served.
of course I'll testify.
I'm glad you feel that way, Edmund.
most don't.
they think silence and integrity are the same thing.
not exactly the image of the new LAPD we're trying to create.
welcome to Los Angeles, the city of the future.
may I make a suggestion, sir?
by all means.
the public will expect the Department to sweep this under the carpet.
don't.
shift the guilt to men whose pensions are secured.
force them to retire.
but somebody has to swing.
so indict, try and convict Richard Stensland and Bud White.
secure them jail time.
the message will be clear.
this Department will not tolerate officers who think they're above the law.
Dick Stensland is an embarrassment as a policeman.
he's had rotten fitness reports from every C. O. he's served under.
but Bud White is a valuable officer.
white's a mindless thug.
no, Edmund but he can answer "yes" to those questions I've asked you before.
the Department and the public need role models.
clean-cut, forthright men the public can admire.
Sergeant,I'll promote you to lieutenant effective immediately.
detective Lieutenant.
ed, you're 30.
your father didn't make lieutenant till he was 33.
I know that, sir.
when he made lieutenant, it was as a detective.
before we start polishing our laurels it'd look better if we had a corroborative witness.
that won't be easy to come by.
the men hate a stool pigeon.
Jack Vincennes.
he hit one of the Mexicans.
a veteran like Vincennes might be willing to admit his own culpability but he'd never rat out a fellow officer.
Jack's the technical advisor on Badge of Honor.
he lives for it.
that's how to get to him.
I'd like you to observe, Ed.
call Sergeant Vincennes.
bright kid.
you may reap the benefit but are you ready to be despised in the Department?
Yes, sir, I am.
so be it.
sergeant, we'll get right to it.
nine civilian witnesses have identified you as hitting Ezekiel Garcia.
but we have a witness who will name names and testify that you hit back only after being hit.
you will testify against 3 officers who have earned their pensions and plead ignorance about the rest.
no thanks. I'm not a snitch.
I'll guarantee you a slap on the wrist, a brief suspension followed by a temporary transfer from Narcotics to Vice.
you transfer out of Vice, you'll be back on the show.
the show?
badge of Honor, Vincennes.
we need to tone down your profile for a bit.
I doubt you've ever taken a stupid breath.
don't start now.
okay, I'll do it.
the grand jury will hear your testimony tomorrow.
and so it goes Detective Lieutenant.
ace them at the grand jury tomorrow, son.
wear a smart-looking suit and ace them.
and Ed lose the glasses.
so you're the stellar witness.
I should have known.
what's the Chief throwing you?
throwing me?
Yeah, Exley, what's the payoff?
you're the payoff expert.
I'm just doing my duty.
come on, you're playing an angle here, college boy.
you'll get something so you don't have to hobnob with the cops who'll hate you for snitching.
if they're making you detective, watch out.
some Bureau guys will burn in this and you'll be working with their friends.
what about you?
I'm snitching 3 old-timers who'll be fishing in Oregon next week.
next to you, I'm clean and smart.
Edmund J. Exley to chambers.
and remember
bud White will fuck you for this if it takes the rest of his life.
captain, what do you want?
call me Dudley.
dudley what do you want?
look, lad,
I admire your refusal to testify and your loyalty to your partner.
I admire you as a policeman and your adherence to violence as a necessary adjunct to the job.
I'm impressed with your punishment of women-beaters.
do you hate them, Wendell?
what do you want?
they're yours.
take them.
there's no bill on me?
4 witnesses recanted their testimony.
Why? They had a change of heart.
Stensland?
your partner's through.
scapegoat on the Chief's orders.
a year from his pension.
Exley! -Exley got what he wanted.
as a politician he exceeds even myself.
the Department needs smart men like Exley and direct men like you.
look, I need you for an assignment the Chief's given me.
a duty few men are fit for but you were born for.
you'd be working out of Homicide at City Hall.
homicide?
working cases?
your talents lie elsewhere, Wendell.
it's a muscle job.
you'll do as I say and ask no questions.
do you follow my drift?
in Technicolor, sir.
meet Tony Brancato and Anthony Trombino two rising lieutenants in the Mickey Cohen rackets.
with the dapper little gent in prison who knows how far they'll go.
the sky's the limit.
Oh, well.
meet Deuce Perkins,
Mickey Cohen's narcotics lieutenant.
could he be behind the hits?
is he consolidating organized crime power?
I suppose not.
one thing's for sure:
2-man triggers are punching the tickets on the Mickster's muscle.
meanwhile, rumor has it the LAPD has set up a not-so-Welcome Wagon to dishearten the criminal element from filling the void left by Mickey's absence.
when I know more, dear readers, so will you.
off the record, on the q. t and very Hush-Hush.
with Mickey Cohen in prison, Los Angeles is organized crime-free.
the Chief wants to keep it that way.
in Cleveland, you're an organized crime associate in desperate need of re-education in the ways of polite society.
I hear things.
like those 2-men shooter teams.
they're slaughtering Cohen's lieutenants.
what do you want?
we want you to go home.
picture-book smut, men.
there's been a bunch of this found at crime scenes lately.
quality ranges from piss-poor to very well done.
look who's back from suspension.
we're honored, Sergeant Jack.
look at that. The Great Jerk-Off Case of 1953.
is there someplace you'd rather be?
Yeah, working Narcotics, looking for Cohen's missing H.
Yeah, finding 25 pounds of heroin would get you plenty of ink.
you should've thought of that before Bloody Christmas.
make a major case.
it's the only way you'll get out of here.
dismissed, gentlemen.
go get the facts, Jack.
just the facts.
whatever you desire.
Hi. I'd like to get a delivery to Beverly Hills.
I don't know you.
a friend just gave me this number and I wanted to find out if
would you grab a reverse directory and shag a name and address for me?
Crestview-2239.
hush-hush, off the record and on the q. t.
Sid, it's Vincennes.
Jackie, you back on narco?
I need some good copy.
I have something going with Vice.
something juicy for the Sidster?
tracking porn. Arty, high-class stuff.
know about Fleur-de-Lis?
slogan's "Whatever you desire " .
no, I've heard burkes.
get me some narco skinny.
I want to do an all-hophead issue.
shvartze jazz musicians and movie stars. You like it?
I'll talk to you later.
what do you got?
the number's not assigned. Sir.
Thanks, Ginger.
a bootleg.
take it easy.
tough break, Stens.
we're going to miss you.
raw deal, Stensland.
here comes the snitch.
sorry about that, Lieutenant.
stay out of trouble, Bud.
I got a few hours.
I'll buy you a drink.
rain check. I got a hot date.
who is she and what did you arrest her for?
it's confidential.
like that magazine that Vincennes scams for.
hush-hush.
I'll see you later in the week.
we'll do the town, on me.
Yeah. I'll bring my wallet just in case.
see you tomorrow.
hold on!
I'll walk down with you.
punk kid. Who is he trying to impress?
Yeah, I wonder.
got himself a real career going.
sergeant Williams, pick up, please.
sergeant Williams?
is there anybody up there in Homicide?
anybody there?
lieutenant Exley.
you've got a homicide downtown.
the Nite Owl Coffee Shop.
I got it.
at least one person's dead.
I stopped for coffee.
no one comes through the front door. Understand?
understand?
I want barricades at both ends of the street. Make sure
I took the call. It's my case.
you don't want it and you can't have it.
I took the call.
it's mine.
I'll make you my second-in-command.
captain, over here, please.
the cook drew a gun and set it off.
the rest died in the men's room.
sir we got a total of 15 spent 12-gauge Remington shotgun shells.
I'm betting 3 men, 5-shot capacity pumps, all of them emptying once.
excuse me, we got an I. D. on one of the victims.
it's Dick Stensland.
at first, I thought she was Rita Hayworth.
Yeah, me too.
hell of a way to avoid prison.
what happened?
appears 3 men held up a coffee shop.
the guy at the register pulled a gun, so they killed him.
then they killed everyone else.
lieutenant, we're ready with that Nite Owl I. D.
is this your daughter?
I don't know.
we know this is difficult.
take your time.
it seems like my Susan.
but my Susan was a blonde, not a redhead.
when was the last time you saw her?
just before Christmas.
we'd fought. I didn't like her boyfriend.
Mrs. Lefferts does your daughter have any distinguishing marks?
you got the wrong idea, mister. I'm fine.
she has a birthmark on her hip.
it's her. My baby!
I'm sorry, Mrs. Lefferts.
who's in charge of this investigation?
captain Smith and myself. Why?
the Nite Owl Massacre.
hyperbole aside this is a heinous crime that requires swift resolution.
six victims.
one of them, one of our own. Dick Stensland.
he was a Nite Owl regular, in the wrong place at the wrong time.
robbery is the likely motive.
we have rubber glove smears on the register and forensics tend toward a trio of shooters.
we do have one hot lead.
three Negro juveniles were seen discharging shotguns in Griffith Park.
a park ranger I. D.'d them as driving a 1948-1950 Mercury coupe maroon in color.
an hour ago a canvassing crew found a news vendor who saw a maroon Merc coupe parked by the Nite Owl at 1 a. m.
DMV has come up with a registration list of Merc coupes.
two-man teams will shake three names apiece.
interrogations will be led by Lt. Edmund Exley.
enough on that!
gentlemen, just go out and get them.
use all necessary force.
the people of Los Angeles demand it.
dismissed.
why not just put a bounty on them?
ready to roll?
you take them, I got something to do.
what if one of these names--?
get somebody else.
I got our assignments, Big V.
we go by this list, we got zero chance of making this collar.
I got a guy who knows what happens south of Jefferson.
he'll put us at 50-50.
what are you doing?
it's the same sort of thing that got you in trouble before.
I'll take those odds.
we got it from here.
you two should bring along a photographer.
I need an address on a customer of yours.
her name is Lynn.
that's all I got to go on?
Yeah.
you already know who I mean, so cough it up.
there's a billing address and a delivery address.
are you Pierce Patchett?
I am.
are you soliciting for police charities?
last time you called my office.
go on down to the driveway. We'll talk there.
what can I do for you?
where were you last night?
I was here hosting a party.
tell me about Dick Stensland.
I don't know him, Mr.--?
officer White.
you know Sue Lefferts?
you know I do. You saw me with her.
how did you find me?
Nick's Liquor.
this is where Lynn Bracken's booze bills go.
of course.
sue Lefferts died at the Nite Owl.
I'm investigating.
everything all right?
fine, Phillip, thank you.
what happened to the other guy, Buzz?
buzz Meeks no longer works for me.
Lefferts looked beat-up Christmas Eve but didn't act it. Why?
I think she'd been hit in the face with a tennis racket.
she was a big doubles fan.
you're a known associate of a woman killed in a mass murder.
want to go downtown to discuss this?
is this official?
somehow I have the feeling this is more personal with you.
all right, then are you concerned about criminal matters peripheral to the murders?
not at the moment. -You're not obligated to report them?
why were Lefferts' eyes black?
I needed a Rita Hayworth to fill out my little studio.
what little studio?
well, there's Gardner, Russell, Monroe, Turner.
Lynn Bracken is my Veronica Lake.
I use girls that look like movie stars.
sometimes I employ a plastic surgeon.
when the work was done, that's when you saw us.
it's why her mom couldn't I. D. her.
Jesus fucking Christ!
no, Pierce Morehouse Patchett.
I sense you're on your best behavior, but that's all I'm saying.
if you persist, we'll meet with my attorney.
would you like Lynn Bracken's address?
I got her address.
find Susan's killer, Mr. White.
I'll give you a handsome reward.
whatever you desire!
I know you're not asleep.
what do you want?
my 5 bucks.
it was the only one I had.
right now?
Hey, doll face, tell him to leave us alone.
I understand.
okay, fine.
Oh, baby bad news.
you have to go.
go?
something very important has come up and you have to go.
I'll make it up to you.
I will, I promise.
excuse me.
is it the cops?
miss Bracken
I'm Officer White.
I've been expecting you, just not this soon.
Pierce called. He told me what happened to Sue.
everything all right, doll?
want me to get rid of him?
hit the road.
maybe I will maybe I won't.
LAPD. Get out of here or I'll have your wife come get you.
officer. -Councilman.
would you care for a drink?
Yeah, Scotch straight.
I was friendly with Sue Lefferts, but we weren't friends.
know what I mean?
you sorry she's dead?
of course I am.
what kind of question is that?
do you know why Pierce is humoring you?
use words like that, you might make me mad.
but, do you know?
Yeah, I know.
Patchett's running whores cut to look like movie stars.
and, judging by his address, something bigger on the side.
he doesn't want any attention.
that's right. Our motives are selfish so we're cooperating.
so cooperate. Why was Susan Lefferts at the Nite Owl?
I don't know. I never heard of the Nite Owl till today.
how'd she meet Patchett?
Pierce meets people.
sue had dreams of Hollywood and this is how they turned out.
thanks to Pierce, we still get to act a little.
tell me about Pierce.
he's waiting for you to mention money.
want advice, Miss Bracken?
it's Lynn.
miss Bracken don't ever try to fucking bribe me or I'll have you and Patchett in shit up to your ears.
I remember you from Christmas Eve.
you have a thing for helping women, don't you?
maybe I'm just fucking curious.
you say "fuck" a lot.
you fuck for money.
there's blood on your shirt.
an integral part of your job?
Yeah. -Do you enjoy it?
when they deserve it.
did they deserve it today?
I'm not sure.
but you did it anyway.
Yeah.
like the half dozen guys you screwed today.
actually, it was only two.
you're different, Officer White.
you're the first man in years who didn't tell me I look like Veronica Lake.
you look better than Veronica Lake.
Pierce Patchett?
he takes a cut of our earnings and invests it for us.
he doesn't let us use narcotics and he doesn't abuse us.
can your policeman's mentality grasp those contradictions?
he had you cut to look like Veronica Lake.
no.
I'm really a brunette, but the rest is me.
and that's all the news that's fit to print.
it's nice meeting you.
I'd like to see you again.
for a date or an appointment?
I don't know.
for a date, I'd know your first name.
forget I asked.
it was a mistake.
Leonard Bidwell?
come down here and talk to us.
how's the left these days?
what's it to you?
I saw you fight Kid Gavilan.
I like your style.
what do you want, Mr. Policeman?
you got a brother in Folsom.
I put him there.
until 1970.
how'd you like to make it 1960?
I know the judge, and Lieutenant Exley is good friends with the D. A.
we're looking for 3 colored guys who like to shoot shotguns.
one owns a maroon Mercury coupe.
want me to snitch?
want to buy your brother 10 years?
it was 10 years, right?
Yeah, 10 years.
you don't have to say anything, just look at this list and point.
he's bad, so I'll just tell you.
sugar Ray Collins.
drives a maroon 49 coupe.
beautiful ride.
don't know about shotguns, but he gets his thrills killing dogs.
he's righteous trash.
look at that. It's five minutes from here.
Thanks.
I'll hear from you about my brother?
keep it up, Lenny. Up!
there it is. It's in the back.
one of ours. -Shit, somebody beat us here!
damn it! My glasses!
you're kidding!
well, just don't shoot me.
what are you doing here?
we were in the neighborhood.
what do you got? -Three 12-gauge pumps.
and cash.
so long, Vice. Badge of Honor, here I come.
fuck you! This is our collar.
quiet!
I'm ranking officer here.
we go as a team. End of story.
right.
how many ways in?
only one. Up the stairs.
he's very serious.
police! Don't shoot!
don't move.
ace him, Jack! Shut up.
anxious, aren't you?
don't kill them.
back, back, back!
get off me!
against the wall!
against the wall!
put your hands up!
get over there.
shut up! Hands behind your back!
so how's it feel getting out of the office?
this came from forensics.
burning clothes.
Casitas Youth Camp.
it's crowded in here, White.
these guys killed Stensland.
the ejection marks on the shells fired from the shotguns are identical to those on the shell casings found at the Nite Owl.
I want confessions, Edmund.
a night's stewing has softened them up.
I'll break them, sir.
are you sure golden boy is up to the task, Cap?
I think you'd be surprised what the lad is capable of.
you're 22. Aren't you, Ray?
did an officer work you over?
you're 22, right?
why do you keep asking that?
22 makes it a gas chamber bounce.
you should've pulled this caper years ago.
get life, do a little Youth Authority jolt transfer to Folsom a big man get yourself a sissy.
I don't truck with no sissies.
Louis.
what?
you did the Casitas Youth Camp with Louis.
why you keep asking me about Louis?
his business is his business.
sugar, Louis told me you went sissy up at Casitas.
you couldn't do the time, so you got a big white boy to look after you.
said they called you Sugar
because you gave it out so sweet.
Louis gave it up at Casitas.
I was the boss jock in my dorm!
Louis was the sissy!
Louis gave it up for candy bars!
he isn't got the sense of a dog!
you like to shoot dogs.
dogs got no reason to live.
feel the same way about people?
What're you trying to say?
we got the shotguns.
I don't own no shotguns.
why were you throwing clothes in the incinerator?
say what?
a neighbor said she saw you throwing clothes in the incinerator.
doesn't look good.
I am not talking till I see a judge.
were you on hop?
you were passed out when we arrested you.
ty and Louis fuck with that shit, not me.
where do they get their stuff?
man. Give me one to feed the D. A.
it'll make me look good and I'll say Sugar Ray's not a punk like his sissy partners.
all right.
tell me one more thing about Jones and Fontaine.
where do they get drugs?
roland Navarette.
he runs a hole-up on Bunker Hill.
and he sells red devils.
Exley's good, I'll give him that.
I'll take a break.
you know, Ray,
I'm talking about the gas chamber and you haven't asked me what this is about.
you got a big "guilty" sign around your neck.
that was masterful, Edmund.
he's ready to go.
give Jones the newspaper.
I want him primed.
take the cuffs off, so he can read it.
ray Collins just ratted you off.
said the Nite Owl was your idea.
I think it was Ray's idea.
you talk, I think I can save your life.
6 people are dead, and someone has to pay for it.
now, it can be you, or it can be Ray.
Louis, he called you queer.
at Casitas, you took it up the ass.
I didn't kill nobody!!
son you know what'll happen if you don't talk.
you'll go to the gas chamber. So admit what you did.
I didn't mean to hurt her.
maybe she's okay.
okay?
they're all in the morgue.
they were dead when you left them.
I just wanted to lose my cherry.
she don't die, so I don't die.
she don't die, so I don't die.
Louis, who's the girl?
what's her name?
who are you talking about?
was she at the Nite Owl?
listen to me, was she at the Nite Owl?
this paper shit isn't shit!
Where's the girl?
you kill her?
Louis lost his cherry, but things got out of hand.
you made her bleed.
she bled on your clothes, so you burned the clothes.
who said that?!
now, listen to me.
if she's alive, she's the only chance you've got.
I think she's alive. -You think?
where is she now?
did you leave her someplace?
where is she?
What're you doing?
white!
1 in 6!
Where's the girl?!
put the weapon down!
Where's the girl?!!
Sylvester Fitch
what?
Sylvester Fitch, 109 Avalon brown corner house, upstairs.
just give me one minute.
you got it.
nobody moves.
we're going in the front.
stay put until I give the word.
he went around back!
I'm Lieutenant Exley.
I'm sorry to ask you this.
I need to know when they left you.
get her to the hospital.
excuse me.
give your career a rest.
leave her alone.
a naked guy with a gun?
who'll believe that?
get the fuck away from me.
how'll it look in your report?
it'll look like justice.
that's what the man got.
justice.
you don't know the meaning of the word.
you think it means getting your picture in the paper.
go after criminals for a change.
Stensland got what he deserved and so will you.
it's best to stay away when his blood is up.
his blood's always up.
perhaps you should stay away from him altogether.
Raymond Collins, Ty Jones and Louis Fontaine.
they are considered armed and dangerous.
repeat. The Nite Owl suspects have escaped.
how'd they get out the window?
they jumped from the 2nd floor.
girl said they left her at 12.
they could get to the Nite Owl by 1.
the question was, where did they get their drugs?
I haven't gotten that far yet.
roland Navarette lives on Bunker Hill, runs a hole-up
anyone seen Jack Vincennes?
is something up?
I need some backup. Go -What? -Nothing. Let's go.
this should be it.
nobody moves!
you're under arrest.
don't shoot, man!
don't move! Don't move!
there he is.
you did good, kid.
you should've seen this place. Blood everywhere.
who would have thought? Shotgun Ed.
Yes. Shotgun Ed.
somebody get him cleaned up.
come on.
Edmund J. Exley has amassed a brilliant record in his 7 years with the Los Angeles Police Department.
recently, he evinced spectacular bravery in the line of duty.
it is our privilege to present him with our highest honor:
the Medal of Valor.
what kind of car was it? -It was a Ford.
Ford. Are you sure?
my husband always drove a Ford.
I know what they look like.
excuse me, ma'am. Just the facts.
light or dark? Light.
and that's really all I remember, Officer.
thank you. You've been a big help.
cut! That's a print.
big Jack! He's back!
Jack's back.
tell Mr. Patchett I have no intention of changing my vote.
it may surprise some that an official would admit to making a mistake but after due consideration
I am changing my position on the matter before the council.
go west, America,
was a slogan of Manifest Destiny.
today is that last step westward with no stop signs no traffic signals, from downtown to the beach in 20 minutes.
what were you going to start with?
prostitution?
gambling?
go back to Jersey, sonny.
this is the City of the Angels and you haven't got any wings.
nice to see you again. Take care.
I wondered when you'd knock on my door again, Officer White.
it's Bud.
bud.
why me?
I don't know.
this election is about the future of law enforcement in Los Angeles.
city Councilman Rogers represents that future.
so let's dig deep and get a moral man re-elected.
Ellis Loew wants to say a few words.
thank you, Brett Chase.
the talented star of Badge of Honor.
let me tell you,
I am so thrilled to be here.
big V.
good to see you back.
how they hanging, Sid?
down around my ankles.
you tight with the D. A. Jackie?
Yes.
Yeah. He tried to throw me off the force last Christmas.
how about some payback, big-time?
plus the usual 50 dollar donation to the Jack Vincennes retirement fund.
did you know the D. A. was a swish?
no kidding?
remember Matt Reynolds? Christmas Eve?
the Movie Premiere Pot Bust?
he just got off the honor farm.
what's he doing here?
Reynolds is acey-deucey, not to mention broke.
I'm getting him to fuck the D. A. for $100.
that's twice the $50 you got for wrecking his career.
come here, come here.
Jesus, don't bring him
that's D. A. Loew right there.
OK.
you need a drink?
Yeah.
look after him.
Matt, this is Jack.
no secrets between me and him.
how you doing? -I'm okay. How're you?
I'm good.
have we met before?
Yeah.
was it at a party?
it was something like that.
fleur-de-lis party, right?
right.
fleur-de-lis.
whatever you desire.
dope, hookers that look like movie stars.
Pierce Patchett has it all.
you could say that again.
Pierce, he's not like regular guys.
I dig him, but you know he scares me too.
Really?
how?
when I came out to L. A. this isn't exactly where I saw myself ending up.
Yeah, well get in line.
your courage, kid. Drink up.
I don't think I should do this.
it's not like you don't know how.
Jack's connected to Badge of Honor.
pull this off, you'll get a part.
I smell a comeback, don't you, Jack?
the D. A.'s free.
go introduce yourself. Go on.
tell him about the opening on the show.
I'm pretty sure I can get you a part on this show.
but that's later on.
tonight, go on over there and pretend it's an acting job.
like show biz.
acting, that's it.
right. No one's going to know about this?
no.
it'll be our secret.
show biz.
that's it. Go on.
show biz.
if Reynolds works his charms, which I know he will they'll be at the Hollywood Center Motel, room 203.
meet me there at midnight for a photo shoot.
and maybe we can work in the Hollywood sign this time.
what do you know about Pierce Patchett?
I know what you know.
he's rich.
invested in the freeways, which'll make him richer.
Why?
I just keep hearing rumors, you know.
high-class porn, drugs, hookers that look like movie stars.
Patchett's what I call twilight.
he isn't queer or Red.
he cannot help me in my quest for prime sinnuendo.
as though Badge of Honor would touch that guy with a 10-foot pole after he's been Hush-Hush cover boy twice in one year.
