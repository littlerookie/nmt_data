private bankers in singapore and hong kong have expressed scepticism over whether the european union will succeed in persuading the two asian financial centres to co-operate in tracking down suspected tax evaders.
private bankers, brokers, trust companies, family offices and wealth managers are all asking the same question: what do wealthy women want?
private banking is less profitable in asia than in europe and the u. s., according to data from nine leading industry players compiled by mckinsey.
private banking represents only part of the total.
private banks are confronting mounting costs in asia even as the region promises a rapidly expanding base of wealthy clients, said senior industry leaders at a conference in singapore last week.
private banks collectively cannot self-insure against a generalised run on the banks.
private banks expecting a bonanza from new wealth in asia, especially among seriously rich individuals in emerging markets such as china and india, are finding the region more difficult to enter than expected, according to a mckinsey survey.
private banks in switzerland, meanwhile, had a cost-to-income ratio of 74 per cent last year, according to a pwc survey.
private banks reduced their medium-and long-term lending to companies and households between 2007 and 2012 in favour of short-term loans; the savings and co-operative banks increased theirs (see chart).
private banks say the recent turmoil in the markets has brought home to clients how important it is that they and their families understand where their money is invested and that they have a well-diversified spread of assets.
private banks, too, are trying novel approaches to help clients inculcate their values in succeeding generations.
