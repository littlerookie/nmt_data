ethanol is typically blended with regular fuel, and a widespread switchover to an ethanol blend (a result of another provision of last year's energy bill) has contributed to some petrol shortages in texas and elsewhere, as the supply chain creaks into life.
ethanol made from waste-and used neat or as a blend in a "flex-fuel" petrol engine-is currently the best deal in town.
ethanol output has more than doubled since 2002, thanks to the development of flex-fuel engines for cars, capable of running on either petrol or ethanol indistinguishably.
