all of them were claimed except for one. So I called the phone company, and I got a name.
Alex Henley, 22, from Astoria, Queens.
and then it dawned on me.
the phone wasn't stolen. It belongs to our vic.
okay, there you go. I sense a promotion in the near future.
so Alex Henley is our John Doe.
so let's see if he connects to anything on the front page of the paper.
no connection.
maybe it's not the stories but the date on that front page.
I hate that sound. No match.
wait a minute, if the connection isn't to our victim, it's got to be to our killer.
Hawkes determined that the murder weapon was a shank, making our killer an ex-con.
so connect February 6, 2011, to any legal actions, dockets, or convictions.
whoa, that's a huge file.
Hey, um, do men wear sequins?
I mean, I know they do in cabarets and Vegas.
okay, well, my point is Hawkes said that Sid found sequins on the the vic's suit, so it could be transfer from our killer.
that's part of the legend.
Wentworth was allergic to sun, so he rarely went out, right, and he always kept the drapes in his penthouse closed.
so he made this request that all his female visitors wear sequins to bring in the light.
the club still offers free entry to any women who still honor that request.
okay, let's limit the search to women.
hopefully one of them will be our perp.
linds, go back a set of mug shots.
okay.
this girl right here, this blonde.
where were you last night, Calvin, around 1: 00 in the morning?
I can't remember.
Really? You know, uh...
this is surveillance footage from the elevator at the crime scene the night of the murder, roughly around 1: 00 a. m. and this girl right here is also in this footage.
she's wearing a sequined scarf.
Macy Sullivan, arrested February 6, 2011.
criminal possession of stolen property, second degree.
february 6, 2011, that's the connection, the day she was arrested.
she did a two year sentence and got out two weeks ago.
okay, we have her in the building, but we don't have her near the body.
transfer of the sequin could have happened anywhere from anyone.
well, she's roughly the same height as the vic. I mean, it fits.
circumstantial.
we need a connector to Alex Henley's murder by putting her on that landing with the murder weapon in her hand.
the partial footprints Adam photographed at the scene are small...could be a woman.
can't take it to the D. A.
any unknown blood at the scene? - All belonged to our vic.
we dusted the door handles and the glass. No prints.
Flack and Lovato got an address on Macy Sullivan from her parole officer.
they're headed there now. P. O. said she didn't check in today.
she's running. Get her picture out.
have all the airports, bus stations, car rental companies check their surveillance for the past 18 hours.
if he finds her, have Flack pick her up for parole violation.
in the meantime... we got to prove that Macy Sullivan's our killer.
Macy Sullivan! NYPD!
she's long gone.
she left in a hurry, too.
the guys at the lab might like this.
I think we're looking for the wrong person.
what do you mean?
I mean she doesn't look like what we think she looks like.
she's no longer a blonde. And she cut her hair.
I need an APB out on a Macy Sullivan. Brunette, short hair.
all units be advised: female matching description, possible sighting Long Island city bus terminal.
proceed, no lights, no sirens.
I see her.
NYPD, freeze!
out of my way!
should've taken it with you.
I was in a hurry.
found Alex Henley's blood on the scarf.
found the scarf in your room. There was a missing sequin.
found that on Henley's body.
why'd you kill him?
can't believe you're here, Macy.
I've been waiting for this moment a long time.
finally seeing you again.
Really?
it's all I've thought about since the day I was convicted.
you were after revenge.
Hey, I was put away for crimes that I did not commit.
no matter how many times I told them I was innocent, it didn't matter.
especially not to Alex Henley.
I trusted him.
I guess I thought I could trust him because he was my boyfriend.
I found the bag in the closet in our apartment.
I looked inside, called Alex, and did what he told me to.
Alex, what do you want me to do with it?
just bring the bag to me.
but why is it in our apartment?
Macy, calm down. Just get here as fast as you can.
I read your case file, and you could've made a deal.
I was innocent. What would I need to make a deal?
you were in possession of stolen property, Macy.
there was a woman that identified you as someone she took a picture with, and then discovered her necklace was gone.
it's the scam that you and Alex played. The one he continued to play.
I was not the thief, okay?
it was Alex. It was only Alex.
I didn't know that he was stealing from people.
I thought we were just taking pictures and making money.
but I never for one second considered that he was the one stealing.
when I found the bag, he told me that he was holding it for a friend, and I believed him.
but there was no friend. - No.
so...
I sat in prison and came up with my plan.
he was gonna pay.
was it all worth going back to prison, Macy?
I got him back for what he did to me.
so, yeah, it was worth it.
Hey, I'm sorry I interrupted your plans for your day off.
Oh, it was an unexpected pleasure, Grant, really.
something my sister would have done.
she was so spontaneous and unpredictable.
and irresponsible, but very loving.
I haven't know you very long, but if feels right that you have her heart.
why was this so important to you?
transplant patients aren't always as lucky as I was.
every breath that I take, I cherish.
it's still hard knowing that someone had to die so I could live.
and I wanted to say thank you... to somebody.
you're welcome.
I-I have a... I have the craziest request.
can I listen to your heart?
hear it beat?
Absolutely.
it's strong.
Oh, it's beautiful.
thank you.
you bet.
okay, so, we're good.
whoa, guys, guys, here she goes. Here she goes.
no, no, this is no time for questions. I got money on the line.
exciting.
Hey, what are you doing here? - Hey, guys.
I thought this was your day off. - It was. It was terrific.
what are you all doing?
Sid thinks she's about to tell him. - Oh, yeah.
who's she? Tell who what?
here we go.
you ready to hit the road?
Danny, I'm pregnant.
what?
are you being serious with me right now?
Yes. I've thrown up twice today.
I've taken four pregnancy tests, and they were all positive.
Really? Really?
Yeah.
there we go. Look-Looking good.
no.
Yes.
Sid... - No, no, no. Wait, wait-wait for it.
Lucy's gonna be a big sister.
we're having a baby!
pay up, gentlemen.
we're having a baby, Mac.
Congratulations.
thank you very much. - There you go.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
where is it? You take checks?
she's pregnant. I'm gone one day and she's pregnant.
don't you think it's a little early to be telling everybody?
uh, I think they already know.
was there a bet?
uh, yeah.
where is she?
what the hell is going on?
we found Christine's phone at a jewelry store robbery.
the blood did match the blood we found in the hotel room.
Christine's room.
we still don't have an exemplar from New York, so we don't know that it's her yet.
what else you have?
okay, we found a print on the jeweler's safe.
hit came back to a James Boyd.
Boyd manages Christine's restaurant.
you son of a bitch.
where is she?
she's in New York.
she never came to Vegas.
what the hell are you talking about?
I owe money to a loan shark back in New York.
what's this have to do with Christine?
I needed to use her to pay him off.
where is she?
she's with my brother; my brother has her.
you're gonna call him, and you're gonna tell him it's over.
I can't.
don't play with me, Jimmy. Come on.
the guy I owe... he got nervous and he grabbed them up.
if I don't bring the diamonds tomorrow night, they're dead.
they're dead.
I'm taking that bastard back to New York with the diamonds.
he's gonna pay off the scumbag he owes.
I'm gonna get Christine back.
I'm not saying don't do this.
I'm just saying you're gonna need my help.
I'm coming with you.
that you, Boyd?
Yeah. I just got in from Vegas.
so where do you want to meet?
38th and Lex.
bring the diamonds.
Shawn and Christine, you're gonna bring 'em, right?
one hour, Boyd. Come alone.
Christine was so excited about going to Vegas.
they took her before she made it out of New York.
mac, we're gonna get her back.
I got visual confirmation.
two of them approaching from the northwest corner.
Yeah, we see them.
any sign of Christine or Shawn Boyd?
negative.
what about you, Adam?
nothing on the traffic cams.
running as many plates as I can, but traffic's picking up.
big brother returns.
where are they?
close by.
diamonds?
it's only fair.
you owed me first.
I've got an image of our two suspects.
Adam, see if you can get us more on Zane than just his first name.
on it.
they're all there, just like we talked about.
six hours, Jimmy.
six hours in Vegas we kept trying to call, but nobody could get a hold of you.
not even your brother.
I told you this... things went bad.
you think I'm stupid?
gun.
I don't like this, Mac. We got a lot of people out here.
he-he's testing him.
give it a second.
Hey, please.
please put the gun back.
what happened in those six hours, Jimmy?
did you get caught?
trying to set me up?
I just want my brother back.
please, you got to believe me.
I just want my brother back.
he's gonna do it.
hold your position.
come. Let's go.
where?
to get your brother and the girl.
you said you were gonna bring 'em here.
we have to take a ride first.
okay, that's not the plan.
Flack, they're headed your way.
I got 'em.
where are we going?
you will see.
you brought the cops?
NYPD. Stop!
where is she?
Where's Christine?
my friend asked you a question.
your friend won't like the answer.
What'd you do to her?
you will never see her again.
where is she being held?
she must be important to you.
you only ask about her.
who are you working with?
who's holding her?
leave it to the Boyd brothers to kidnap a cop's girlfriend.
you took Christine and Shawn as collateral for the $100, 000 he and his brother owed you.
everyone needs insurance.
any word on Jimmy Boyd?
he's still in surgery.
when you questioned him in Vegas, he give you anything on Zane?
no, he said he only met him once.
knew his first name, that's all.
said the guy was a loan shark that he and his brother, Shawn, were borrowing money from.
what a mess.
guy's in my custody.
I had to pull strings just to bring him back to New York.
do we know anything more about this guy?
I just got off the phone with Adam. Facial recognition was inconclusive.
he ran his prints through AFIS, got nothing back.
he's running them through Interpol now.
how's it going in there?
not good.
did you do something to her?
is she alive?
I'm done talking.
you can end this.
just tell me what you did with her.
go to hell.
tell me where she is.
they arrested Zane.
I don't know.
what do you want me to do?
Yeah.
I'll take care of it.
you and your brother, you were working for the cops?
no.
what happened? Where's Jimmy?
he's dead.
Jimmy's dead.
you set us up!
I swear, I don't know what you're talking about.
I think you do, I think you do.
don't shoot him.
police have your friend. They're gonna figure out where we are.
if you kill us, then you'll lose the only leverage that you've got.
what kind of leverage could you possibly be?
my-my-my boyfriend's a cop.
anything in your autopsy point to who our John Doe is or where he may have been in the last 24 hours?
I found non-fatal acute pulmonary inflammation.
something he inhaled within the last 24 hours caused irritation to the lining of his lungs.
I sent a sample to Tox.
I also discovered his fillings are made of glass ionomer.
these weren't don't by any dentist in the U. S.
from scarring on the surrounding gums, I'd say they're about three months old.
that tattoo on his bicep suggests he's from Egypt.
it's from the story of Seth and Apep.
Seth and Apep.
um, Seth, the god of chaos, protects Ra by beheading Apep, the god of evil.
it's an ancient Egyptian myth.
so chaos destroying evil.
sounds like gang ideology.
it could tie back to a gang in Egypt.
or one here with Egyptian ties.
Hey, it looks like our John Doe was keeping some kind of a ledger.
well, we think he's Egyptian.
would explain the Arabic.
Yeah, I don't know what these numbers correspond to yet.
did you find anything in tox?
Yeah, lung sample came back positive for alpha-terpineol.
all right, that's found in fragrances, right?
well, unfortunately it's found in everything from perfume to aftershave, making it virtually impossible to narrow down where he inhaled it.
I feel so helpless, knowing that Christine is out there alone.
I know. We just got to stay positive for Mac.
Yeah.
what's this?
I found this in his pocket but I couldn't make it out.
Nailah's Cleaners.
you said that tox detected alpha-terpineol?
that's found in industrial fabric softeners.
Bye. - Thanks for this.
okay, don't trip.
that's the Christine you always talked about at the academy?
mm, this is nice.
I love you, Christine.
just got a hit on Interpol.
wanted for murder in Egypt.
killed a member of their parliament. About a year ago.
well, if he's been here less than a year, chances are he's working for someone.
we need to find out who that is.
this was left for you at the front desk.
what is it?
I don't know. It just came in.
15 minutes to the call.
this is a lot for anyone to handle.
even Mac.
he puts the burden of the case on his shoulders even when it's a stranger.
now that it's Christine, it makes me worry for the people he's after because he's not gonna stop till he finds them.
I know how he feels.
few months ago, my... my granddaughter was kidnapped.
I would have done anything to get her back.
tell me you found her.
Yes, yeah, thanks to the people around me.
you know, Mac's lucky to have you.
all of you.
all right, I'm linking to every phone company in the tristate area.
when the call comes in, I'll determine the service provider, whether it be cell or landline, and then we can get our trace on.
excuse me.
I'm Detective Messer, this is Dr. Hawkes.
do you mind if we ask you a few questions?
no, not at all.
do you recognize this man?
no, I don't.
this was his ticket.
seems he was a customer of yours?
are you sure you don't recognize him?
he's no customer.
he collects money from me every week.
in this neighborhood, you don't do business for free.
and how long has that been going on?
a few months.
he says it's for protection, but it's Faraj we need protection from.
I don't know his last name.
do you know where he lives? Does he have any relatives in town?
have you ever seen him with this man?
he's coming in with Faraj once or twice.
I don't know his name.
this is a very tight community, like a family.
I can ask around, but people are scared.
I don't think anyone's going to say anything.
I'm sorry, Detectives. I wish I could help more.
thank you.
DNA came back on the tongue.
belongs to a male.
Oh, thank God.
if it's not Christine's, whose is it?
it could be Shawn Boyd's.
I got 'em running it through CODIS now.
where the hell is Mac?
what do you want to do?
I'm taking it.
detective Jo Danville. Who am I speaking with?
there's a fountain in Fong's alley, Chinatown.
next to it is a bench.
there will be instructions waiting in an envelope.
where are Christine and Shawn?
if you want to see them alive again, be at the bench in 15 minutes.
keep him talking.
we need to know they're alive first.
15 minutes.
Hello?
got it.
chelsea, 21st and Eighth.
I'll call Flack. Danny, you head to Chinatown.
it's transmitting from right here.
there's no one over here.
signal hasn't moved since Adam locked in on it.
looks like a burner.
Yeah, it's Messer.
Danny, we struck out here... what about you?
no, there's no envelope here.
what the hell's going on, Jo?
why make contact with us just to take us for a ride?
we need to find Mac.
mac, what are you doing?
damn it, D.B.,you shouldn't have followed me.
I saw you leave the lab...I figured something was going on. Thought you might need some backup.
you have to leave now.
they contacted you, didn't they?
they had Christine call my cell phone.
this is Mac Taylor.
mac, it's me.
thank God.
are you all right?
mac, listen.
she gave me an address of a warehouse.
said to come alone.
told me if I didn't, they'd kill her.
well, Mac, they just separated you from your team.
look, I know what I'm doing, D.B.
you of all people should understand that.
I do understand. That's why I'm here.
I'm not trying to stop you, but I'm not gonna leave you alone either.
look. I'll be close by... they won't even know I'm there.
Taylor.
you proved you're willing to work "alone.
now we make a trade.
Christine for Zane." - Okay.
uh, I understand.
I'll figure it out.
don't worry.
bring him to Teterboro Airport,"hangar 20. One hour.
or they'll kill me, Mac.
so he's got blood on his chin, but no pooling on the ground.
the lingual artery supplies blood to the tongue, and if it was severed here, let's just say we'd be looking at a much bigger mess.
he was killed somewhere else, then dumped here.
and Mac called it in.
they must've wanted him to find it.
maybe the kidnappers contacted him.
that's exactly what happened.
15 minutes to the call.
that's why they got us running all over town, so Mac would be here alone.
so what's our next move?
mac feels he needs to go with this alone, we need to trust him.
our job is to follow the science, just like any other case.
where the hell have you been?
everybody's been looking for you.
where is he, Flack? Where's Zane?
he's in holding. But not for long.
what do you mean?
once Zane's fingerprints got a hit in Interpol, the, uh, Department of Justice was alerted.
they're taking him into federal custody.
Yeah.
two U. S. Marshals are on their way over now.
well, has-has his provisional warrant been signed yet?
Yeah, it's a done deal.
once those guys walk through the door, he's no longer our prisoner.
well, until they get here, he's still ours.
I tested the blood. It's a match for Shawn Boyd.
it's awfully intricate to draw as you're dying.
well, I don't think he did it.
there's no traces of blood on his fingers.
well, if Shawn didn't draw it, then who did?
this eye is a fingerprint.
Christine.
new York State requires fingerprints for anyone who gets a liquor license.
she knew the body would end up here.
Christine's trying to tell us something.
we got to find out what this symbol means.
looks like this guy kept records of all his collections, and by the looks of it, he was pulling in several thousand a week.
can you pull up a map of all the addresses listed?
I'm one step ahead of you.
all these places are businesses in Little Egypt.
do you recognize one of the locations?
no. But I should.
Nailah's cleaner isn't on this map.
do you recognize this man?
he collects money from me every week.
she was lying.
a trade?
if I don't do it, they're gonna kill her.
now we make a trade.
Christine for Zane.
bring him to Teterboro Airport,"hangar 20.
one hour" Or they'll kill me, Mac.
then we talk to the marshals.
there's an innocent life at stake; they'll play ball.
not before running it up to the attorney general's office.
we don't have that kind of time.
then we ask for more time.
these men aren't patient.
they've already proven they'll kill to make a point.
you said it yourself: there's an innocent life at stake.
I can't take any chances, Don.
not on this one.
so what?
we just... spring the dude and walk him out the front door as the federal marshals are walking in?
Yes.
I'm here to take him out.
fellas. - You must be Detective Flack.
I am. Thank you for coming.
can't wait to get this guy off my hands.
all right, I'll just look this over real quick.
let's go.
Hey, sorry, I got hung up there.
are these the guys that are here for Zane Kalim?
Yeah. This is Detective Russell, out of Vegas.
he helped us apprehend Kalim.
appreciate your help. - Yeah. Yeah.
um... boy, I just better come clean here.
if you go on back to the cells, you're not gonna find Kalim.
so where is he?
go ahead, tell 'em.
he was taken over to the 88 in Brooklyn.
I got a uni picking him up right now.
it's all right. Actually, you know, it's my fault.
uh, when I was booking Kalim, I-I filled out the wrong...
the wrong form.
those damn things look so different in Vegas, and I'm a little tired to tell you the truth.
uh, tell you what. In the meantime, we will...
we'll grab a cup of coffee while we wait?
Yeah. - Fellas, I'm so sorry.
you know what? I wouldn't worry about it.
I'm, uh... I'm pretty sure that our guy's, uh...
walking him out of the precinct as we speak.
faraj kept a detailed ledger of every collection he's made over the past two months.
there's no mention of Nailah's or her dry cleaners.
why leave her off the list?
because.
he's not collecting from her, it's the other way around.
Nailah immigrated to the U. S. about ten years ago.
when she was applying for her green card, she legally changed her name to Fayed.
what was it before? - Kalim.
just like Zane. - Exactly like Zane.
they're brother and sister.
being related to someone doesn't make you guilty of their crime.
true, but this doesn't help her case.
that's the same symbol Christine left on Shawn Boyd's body.
it's on a restaurant in Little Egypt directly across the street from Nailah's dry cleaners.
Christine could have seen that from wherever she's being held.
that's what she's trying to tell us. She's at Nailah's.
come alone?
show me Christine.
Where's Zane?
satisfied?
now let me see Christine.
first take him out. Hand him over.
then I'll tell you where your girlfriend's being held.
change of plan.
now we're gonna go get Christine together, or I'm gonna shoot you dead right now.
where is she?
I'm tired of playing games.
let's play one of mine.
we'll see how far you're willing to go.
tell me when you've had enough.
wait!
Hey, please! Please!
Where's Christine?
no, no!
I'll take you to her! I'll take you to her!
how many men are holding her?
just one.
where? - In the back.
what's his name?
this him? - Yeah.
tell him to bring her outside.
don't try anything.
this one's full of bullets.
where the hell is he?
I don't know.
this is Ahmed. Leave a message.
all right.
let's go.
Nailah Fayed, we have a warrant to search the premises.
or should we call you Nailah Kalim?
don't make me chase you.
then I'm gonna have to shoot you.
is there anybody else in the building?
no.
which way? - Over there.
where? - Over here.
clear.
where? - Back there.
I got blood.
she was here.
so where is she now?
Hey, Ahmed.
get the girl. Bring her up front.
thank God, Mac.
it's okay, it's okay.
okay. It's okay, it's okay.
you're safe now. You're safe.
I knew you'd come for me. - Always.
I love you, Mac. - I love you, too.
it's okay.
I love you. I love you, too.
What'd the marshals say?
they were pissed.
but they'll get over it.
not much you can do.
clerical errors tend to happen from time to time.
clerical errors, huh?
Yup.
Hey, Jo. - Oh, Mac.
thank God we got Christine back.
how is she?
thankful it's over.
Yeah. - We took her to Trinity General.
so this is Zane's sister?
and the woman behind the blossoming crime family.
the laundry was her front.
I'm on my way to interrogate her and find out what else she was hiding.
I'm sorry I kept you in the dark.
if there was any other way...
I know.
Oh, one more thing.
the guy you arrested... Omar.
he told this wild story about playing a game of Russian roulette.
you wouldn't happen to know anything about that, would you?
hey... Let's see how far you're willing to go.
not much of a game when the gun's empty.
just when you think you got a moment to yourself, somebody knocks on your door.
well, I guess that's the job we signed up for.
there's got to be some perk to being the boss, right?
Yeah, the seminar in Hawaii comes to mind.
Yeah, that would do it, that would do it.
how's Christine doing?
she's coming along.
I was just about to head back to the hospital.
I guess it's your turn to take care of her, huh?
Yeah, it is.
so, when are you taking off?
uh, first thing in the morning.
and Boyd?
he made it out of surgery, so, as soon as he's safe to travel, they'll transfer him back to Vegas and have him stand trial for the murder of Sadat.
D. B.,I can't thank you enough for coming back here with me.
hey... No, no.
you stuck your neck way out on the line.
much more than I could have asked for.
I want you to know how grateful I am.
thank you.
next time we come to Vegas, dinner's on me.
damn right.
I'm gonna bring my whole family,too.
Freeze!
drop the weapon!
don't move!
Freeze!
slide the knife to me.
she deserved to die.
she took everything I worked for.
slide the knife to me! Do it now.
Mac! Officer down.
I need a bus at 675 Bowery.
we caught the son of a bitch, Mac.
we got him... got him.
one WEEK LATER
Aah... geez...
this lovely stack of papers needs your signature.
Yeah. I'll do my best.
I'll have Adam pick it up later tonight.
you need all this stuff by tonight?
you show me no mercy.
also need you to take a look at this.
photo was lifted from security footage from a bar in Astoria, Queens.
Shane Casey's still posing as a cop.
Yeah. And he still has Danny's stolen badge and debit card.
got another hit on my debit card.
an ATM in Midtown.
Shane Casey.
this was last night, Mac.
we were investigating an unrelated shooting.
we're trying to track him down.
didn't you bring me any good news?
actually, I did.
breakfast.
something fabulous.
nice.
you're gonna have to live with the fact that you'll smell like garlic all day, but it might take the edge off your pain medication.
speaking of which, how are those ribs?
Oh, still broken.
what?
you know, it's like a soap opera in this complex over here.
I had no idea what was going on in the world in the middle of the day until I got marooned in this chair.
mac Taylor! You're spying on your neighbors!
that young lady over there
she's supposed to be in school.
she's about to get caught.
her mother's coming down the hall.
she's in trouble, big-time.
God, I miss being a teenager.
Yeah, me, too.
I was grounded every other weekend.
we're gonna need something to wash this down.
there's some bottled water in the fridge.
Oh, great. I got it.
okay, I've got two waters, and I brought two forks for those of us who are chopstick-challenged.
Oh. Great.
let's eat.
hurts to even inhale.
whoa.
Yeah, about $2, 000 in cash, but no wallet and no I. D.
and he had at least $200 more than that.
Yeah, when the bartender tried to check his I. D., our Vic said he forgot his wallet and gave him $200 in cash to let it slide.
bartender have any idea who did this? No.
he didn't even know there was an altercation.
another customer found the Vic when he came in to take a leak.
did you just use "take a leak
and "altercation" in the same sentence?
you know, I don't know what we're looking at here.
there's no gunshot or stab wounds, no sign of head trauma.
there's a bloody nose, but no swelling or bruising on the Vic's face to suggest he was even punched.
so maybe our guy knew how to duck and throw a couple jabs of his own.
no, don't think so.
there are no defensive injuries of any kind.
his fists are clean.
I don't think this guy landed a punch.
okay, so he wasn't the one looking for a fight.
that means the blood and skin on this mirror belong to our attacker, whose only weapon was his fist.
well... he must have missed with a jab, and then landed with a well-placed body shot that caused internal injuries and killed or Vic.
so why didn't our John Doe fight back?
fear? FLACK: This guy?
Hey, he was clearly sweating.
those are urine stains on his pants.
are you kidding me?
who could make a big strong guy like that scared enough to pee his pants?
those are some pretty rough-looking bruises you got on your hand there, big guy.
I work hard.
on what, breaking glass?
what that's supposed to mean?
your seven years of bad luck is starting right now, Mr. Picozzi.
this guy dead?
come on, you didn't realize how hard you hit him?
I didn't hit nobody.
I don't even know who this character is.
okay, so you didn't introduce yourself before you landed the punch that ended his life.
but you didn't have to know him to kill him.
I didn't kill nobody, lady.
I don't think he knows how this works.
see, we found your blood in the restaurant bathroom when we found his body.
center Street Grill ring a bell?
and unlucky for you, that blood got a hit in CODIS.
and you may be wondering how we got a match to you in our database.
you got a bunch of priors for violent assault.
is that your thing?
huh? You like beating people up?
that's your MO?
except, this time, you killed a man.
that's a bunch of crap.
you guys got this whole thing sideways. No, no.
what we got is your blood on a cracked mirror at a murder scene.
Yeah, 'cause I hit it. Not the guy. There was no guy.
all right. What happened?
I was at the grill, okay?
at the bar, drinking with my girl.
out of nowheres, the broad tells me she's pregnant.
inside, I'm freakin'.
I do the gentlemanly thing, excuse myself from the table, enter the bathroom and punch the living hell out of the mirror, 'cause I ain't ready to be a father.
that's a good story.
it's the truth, and I want a lawyer.
hmm. You know, Troy, innocent folks don't usually ask for a lawyer.
that's 'cause they're stupid and don't have the balls to sue you guys for false arrest.
no way.
no way.
is this really Namath's signature?
Yes.
put the football down, Adam.
not good to touch things...
I gotta get me one of these.
what is it?
it's a ball chain machine.
it's a rare and very fragile antique.
yeah?
you know, boss, I would have never imagined you'd have such cool stuff in your apartment.
well, it.. it... It's not that you're not cool, it's just...
you know, I just thought that, you know, well, you wouldn't be so, well, not so...
cool?
no. That is...
that's not what I meant...
are you done with those signatures?
Yes. We're good.
give you this.
and I'll take that.
it's a case file of a crime we picked up today.
and I'm outta here.
Adam... Yeah?
we have a name on this Vic?
no. Still John Doe.
when were we dispatched to the scene?
just after lunch.
no autopsy report?
Sid is still trying to determine the cause of death.
something wrong?
I believe I saw this guy this morning, in that apartment over there.
was he dead?
no. Very much alive.
let yourself out.
okay.
don't touch anything.
female VOICE The number you have called is not in service.
please check the number you've dialed.
I printed our Vic.
no hits in AFIS.
this guy is clean, and I mean really clean.
his body was coated with various disinfectants.
head to toe.
compulsive disorder? Possible germaphobe?
it would certainly be an extreme case.
we know cause of death? No.
I searched the torso for subdermal bruising, any broken bones or fatal internal injuries to major organs, and found nothing.
confirmed your analysis at the scene of no evidence of blunt-force trauma.
my next thought was heart failure or stroke.
right. Not the case.
this was a very healthy young man.
so he died at the scene of a fight, but wasn't in the fight. Right.
confirms Troy Picozzi's claim that he didn't hit him.
not the guy. There was no guy.
well, that leaves this eczematous-type reaction on the victim's left hand and wrist which, at this point, I can only say is symptomatic of some type of allergy.
that doesn't quite explain the nosebleed.
Lindsay confirmed that it was our John Doe's blood in the bathroom sink.
means the answer's in our tox results.
has to be.
of course, if that comes back negative, our Vic died of natural causes.
hello.
it took me a while to track down your number.
I-I... I'm in New York.
I know you're in New York.
you look great.
look out the window.
the building across the way. I'll wave.
when did you move in?
eight months ago.
so, what brought you back to New York?
a meeting of the Pathologists Association, and I have a charity benefit tomorrow afternoon.
get to catch up with some old friends.
you do look great.
how well do you know that guy?
Oh, he's just a friend.
Oh, well, there are plenty of really nice hotels in the city.
he had a spare room, and it...
just made things easier.
your escort to the charity benefit?
I hope you're following Dr. Hunter's orders.
????????????????????????????
she's got great taste in flowers.
an orchid.
in England, they're a symbol for beauty and love.
chinese believe they're a cure for illness.
Aubrey's a lovely name.
good beside manner?
how do you know this Kevin?
professor Scott.
he was a colleague of mine, when I was teaching at Chelsea University.
so what do you know about his background?
any arrests?
criminal record? Mac.
is this an interrogation?
there's been some strange things going on in his apartment the past few days.
have you been peering through your neighbors' windows?
a man was found dead yesterday afternoon.
a few hours before, he paid a visit to Kevin Scott.
um... I-I should go.
no. Listen, he brought home a canary.
I saw him dispense something from a dropper in the bottom of the bird's cage.
whatever it was, killed that bird.
is a brilliant Professor of mathematics.
he's an intelligent, funny, smart human being.
he's probably quite distressed that his bird and-and a man he possibly knows are both dead.
did he mention either one of them to you?
there is a briefcase and a canister somewhere in that apartment that can prove that he killed that bird.
mac, the thing that impressed me the most when I met you was your passion for your work...
but not everything is a crime.
it was really great to see you.
Peyton, listen to me for a second.
I'll-I'll let myself out.
I'll lock the door behind me.
I processed the Vic's clothing.
the fabric was covered in disinfectant.
that's the same result Sid got from the Vic's skin.
right. It was also on his watch, so I had Sid swab underneath where his watch would have been.
there was a void. No disinfectant.
which means the chemical was applied while he was wearing all of his clothes.
I know. It's like it was sprayed on him.
it stained some of his clothing.
doesn't make sense.
Hey, guys. I got tox results.
the eczema on our John Doe's left hand was a chemical burn.
a reaction to a very potent poison.
well, that explains the urine and the sweat stains.
and the nosebleed.
this poison have a name?
so far, no. Sid's trying to narrow it down.
but he did say it was the fumes from the poison that caused our victim's death.
it's deadly just breathing it in.
all right, we need to find out who this John Doe is, where he was before he died and if anybody else out there came in contact with this mystery poison.
curiosity got the best of her.
I knew you couldn't shake this, Peyton.
U u found it.
and no bird.
isn't it a crime to spy on your neighbors?
uh, from this distance? Nope.
not even a misdemeanor.
check the paper lining in the cage.
no trace?
nothing.
Peyton, what are doing?
that's it. You found it.
that's the case. Bring it over.
I'm not taking it out of his apartment.
hold on.
Oh, now you're showing off.
he's back.
Peyton, go to your phone.
Kevin Peyton?
Ah. Allergies.
I hope you don't mind, but I looked through your medicine cabinet.
no, of course. I just don't have any medication like that.
I know. I know. I'm, uh...
I'm just gonna run to the pharmacy and get something.
sure. Yeah.
okay.
so I'll, uh, see you later?
Yeah.
Hi, Stella. Mac, what are you two doing here?
Hey.
I think I may know a little something about your poison victim.
and I'm here to prove a man innocent.
I got a little Intel on Professor Scott.
he has a history of espousing various conspiracy theories.
sharing them with his students got him into a little trouble.
every university has at least one unconventional Professor.
Aw, come on, Peyton.
this guy's ideas here are...
totally anti-American.
look at this.
water fluoridation, tsunami bombs, chemtrails.
what are chemtrails?
well, some people believe that vapor exhaust from aircraft are actually dangerous biochemicals dispersed into the air.
which only proves that Kevin's a little odd.
prints from the tape lift show that both Kevin Scott and our John Doe touched the case, analysis of the paper on the bottom of the birdcage does not confirm evidence of poison.
thank you.
many poisons are highly volatile.
they can evaporate within minutes.
just because it wasn't detected, doesn't mean it wasn't there.
Scott's background says he was recently forced into retirement by the university.
eight months ago.
he stopped teaching.
he never mentioned it.
there were also two recent arrests for public disturbance.
none of what you're saying sounds like the man that I know.
well, we don't have anything that connects Kevin Scott to the poison, or to our John Doe's death.
Sid's autopsy report indicates a loss of blood from the Ne e of the victim.
that's the same thing I saw happen to the bird.
I think they were both victims of poison.
but without that case or canister, we can't prove it.
Yes, we can. If we e find that canary.
I'm going to go back to my apartment.
Lindsay, I'll need whatever you have left of the paper
Peyton collected from their cage.
and some wasps.
Peyton collected Okay. from Some what? e.
wasps have an incredible sense of smell.
a highly sensitive antennae.
why use wasps instead of dogs?
dogs attract attention.
mac doesn't want his neighbors to know that they're under surveillance.
dogs also take days instead of minutes to train, Adam.
so this ??? will actually be able to find that ???
the strong scent of the canary Dogs also Ta d day instead remains in the paper.
the other surrounds the cube and is the predominant smell as they eat the sugar.
so the wasps will associate the scent of the canary with the sweet taste of sugar.
that bird could be buried anywhere out there.
or not at all.
Scott came back to his apartment wearing work gloves.
from here, it looked like they were stained with some kind of rust-colored dirt.
if that bird is out there in that courtyard, these wasps will find it.
they can detect chemicals at very minute levels, down to parts per billion.
I could make this all much easier.
I could just ask Kevin, over dinner, if he happened to kill his bird and his friend.
and ruin all the fun?
well, it's been 15 minutes.
I think these guys are ready.
what's that?
a wasp hound.
you're gonna walk the wasps.
huh. Me?
you.
are they doing anything yet? No movement.
Hey, wait. Right there.
hold it.
they're definitely getting excited about something.
keep walking.
necropsy findings on the bird.
as you can see, there were high levels of isopropyl methylphosphonofluoridate detected in the bird's brain tissue.
a metabolite of... sarin.
Yeah. Synthetic nerve Agent.
500 times more potent than cyanide.
clear, colorless and has no odor.
easily absorbed in the skin and inhaled.
Sheldon, Sid suggested that the victim had an allergy.
Yeah, originally thought to be an eczematous reaction, but could have been a chemical burn, or a result of contact with sarin.
which means that there's a possibility that your John Doe poisoned himself without even knowing it.
which means that the poisoning was accidental, not murder.
Yeah, but what about the bird?
also an accident?
it was Scott's way of testing his poison's effectiveness.
whether he killed our John Doe or not, he's definitely got something planned.
okay, well, all of this should be enough to get us a search warrant for his apartment, right?
if a few drops of sarin can kill a person in a matter of seconds...
we need to find out where Kevin Scott is and exactly what he has planned.
all right, so, Missing Persons got a match to our Vic.
his name is Ivan Paluck, and he worked at Hedge Island.
it's located off the northeast coast of Gardner's Bay, but it's unidentified on most maps.
there's a government animal disease research lab out there.
fancy name for a germ laboratory.
A17. Highly restricted.
they study rare biological elements for military use and education.
this is all making sense now, Danny.
the disinfectant on Paluck's skin and clothes was a result of the precautions that the lab would have taken to protect its workers.
Ivan Paluck smuggled the sarin off the island,
Danny, and he was working with Kevin Scott.
boss.
I just sent you a video from my phone.
run an analysis on it right away.
see if you can determine what Kevin Scott is saying and what number he called.
have Flack get a warrant.
call me when you get something.
Kevin Scott-- NYPD. Open up!
boss. Adam.
I got something else for you.
blueprints?
of what?
that's what I need you to get Lindsay to find out.
Hey, guys, what do we have? Hey.
I enhanced the video that file Mac sent over, and I got six of the seven digits that Professor Scott was dialing.
that narrows it down to possibly ten numbers.
right. Nine of whom were a dead end, but the tenth one, that was a real winner.
came back to Ivan Paluck.
I compared it to a DMV photo of the Vic, and I got a match.
if Kevin Scott was calling Paluck, means he had no idea he was dead.
also the video file that Mac sent over had no audio, so I used a lip-reading software.
I'll be there tonight.
it's on.
sounds like he's confirming some sort of prearranged meeting.
something's going down tonight.
we just need to figure out where.
I think this could help.
the blueprint from Scott's apartment was labeled, but the letters are too faded to read.
I used a laser to raise a latent print but...
...this is all I got.
any chance we can buy a vowel?
from the looks of the architectural design on the blueprint, I'm thinking it's an older building.
Conserv... Conservatory!
okay, run the blueprints against Microsoft Photosynth Mapping.
we might be able to get a 3-D match.
okay. I'll start with conservatories in Manhattan.
there we go.
Manhattan Enrichment Conservatory.
that's gotta be where Scott's headed.
mac, inhalation is the fastest way to poison all those people with sarin, if that Scott's intent.
he'll more than likely go through the air-conditioning system in the building.
I need to know exactly where the air-conditioning vents are.
one is on the East side of the building in a compressor room on the eighth floor.
the main compressor is on the roof.
we're 84 at the conservatory.
I don't want to scare him off.
keep all sector cars out of the area and notify FDNY.
I don't want to hear any sirens. Yeah, I'm on it.
Flack, go around to the freight elevator in the back.
make your way up to the roof. Done.
Peyton had plans to be at this event.
I'll find her.
you keep a low profile.
if he's in there, you see him before he sees you, all right?
I'm on it.
I'll find the security camera monitors.
excuse me. Peyton.
Mac. Did he meet you here?
no, I haven't seen or heard from him.
come with me.
Stella, got eyes on Professor Scott.
he's dressed in a security guard uniform.
he's entering a doorway at the West end of stairwell number four.
Where's it lead to?
Danny, it's a stairwell that leads to all floors. And the roof.
looks like he already got to the security guard.
is he still alive?
Danny, he killed a security guard.
be careful.
let's see if we can find him.
that's him.
that's Kevin.
I can't believe that he's doing this.
he's on the sixth floor.
Danny, he's three floors above you.
he's heading past the ninth floor.
Danny, he's definitely headed to the roof.
be careful.
copy that, Mac. Flack, he's headed your way.
that's far enough, Professor.
lose the container.
get on your knees and put your hands behind your head now.
Danny, I got him.
copy that. I'm on my way.
don't make me say it again.
lose the container, put your hands behind your head.
do it now!
don't move! - That's it! Right there!
don't move!
we're not ready.
no one is ready for biological warfare.
our citizens-- they're not safe.
you're not safe.
I've proved that.
if I can get a deadly gas into a room full of political dignitaries without detection, imagine what our enemies can do.
I mean...
wake up, people.
I've done you a favor. Look around you.
they are among us.
and they are planning their next attack.
it's the only way he'd agree to a confession.
thinks we're gonna upload it onto Youtube or something.
his mission statement.
that guy's crazy.
no one is safe.
these cuffs
they-they just prevent me from helping you.
thank you.
I didn't want to be right about Kevin Scott, Peyton.
wasn't exactly how I imagined I'd see you again.
everything about the two of us was always unpredictable.
that's why it was so great.
I'm so sorry for the way I ended everything.
you deserved so much better than that.
I needed to be with my family in London, and I... I didn't want to change my mind.
I didn't want to have to see you, look you in the eye...
and choose between you and them.
I understand the choice you made.
I just don't understand how you handled it.
you gave me no chance.
and I missed you.
so...
Dr. Aubrey...
do you like her?
Dr. Hunter?
we're just friends.
we started out as just friends.
you jealous?
Yeah.
good.
I'm still wounded here, you know.
you can see an awful lot through this window.
this is going to be good.
two nights ago, in Miami...
woman: Hey, look at that plane!
let's flash them.
Yeah! It's on fire!
dude, swerve! Oh, my...
you okay?
don't!
don't, please don't.
he's on a killing spree in Miami.
please... Shh...
I shot her.
Where'd you bury her body?
I took care of it.
you don't understand.
look in that guy's eyes...
...It's too late.
Caine: That younger woman is a hostage.
let the girl go.
Oh, not yet.
he told me he was going to New York City to make things right.
he's not gonna stop until we make him stop.
could I die from this?
that's the fun.
so what's it like to grow up with all this money?
what are you gonna do to me?
Oh, first things first.
go.
you said nobody'd be home.
nobody's supposed to be here.
you trying to set me up?
no, no, really. Hey, look who's here.
Hey, everybody, it's Alexa.
I thought you were in Miami.
um, where's my sister?
I am so high.
sorry.
Alexa, you promised to show me your bedroom.
will you excuse us?
make all the noise you want.
open it.
I didn't fly you a thousand miles for nothing.
give me your hand.
double-crossed me?
no, I didn't...
Oh, my God, Dalton.
you're bleeding.
it's not mine.
Where's Alexa?
Oh, my God.
I want everybody to get on the ground face down, hands behind your back.
now.
you do what I say,
I won't hurt you.
I promise.
you said you weren't gonna hurt us!
FLACK: How did this happen?
there were security guards at every one of the Endecotts' Manhattan properties.
he's got to be here somewhere.
we sure this is Darius?
take a good look at the position of these kids.
look familiar?
Yeah.
those nurses in Midtown.
he played in their blood.
any one of these kids Alexa Endecott?
she never saw it coming.
no.
safe is open and empty.
it's a biometric lock.
TAYLOR: Explains why he brought her to New York.
needed her hand, her blood vessels.
why would he bring Alexa all the way to New York for money?
thought he got money from the groupie in Florida.
it's not Endecott money.
and, as we know, money is only half of it.
last thing Darius said down in Miami:
he was coming to New York to make things right.
think he has?
not even close.
Darius is in the wind.
I got a broadcast out, Tri-State area.
the M. E.'s office finished bagging the last kid.
Alexa's next.
we found her younger sister, Sarah.
we're pulling her out of school, Hathaway Prep.
she's on her way to the precinct.
parents?
on their way back from Australia.
it's obvious he targeted Alexa for money, but why her?
we're not finding evidence of any previous connection between her and Darius.
then we'll work with current connections.
I need this lock taken back to the lab. I'll get the company out here ASAP.
room's been sealed, right?
Yeah, to the man.
red fabric.
from inside the vault.
make sure this gets to Trace.
I'll stay with the body till the M. E. gets up here.
all right.
guard on duty?
Yeah, M. E. says that his neck was snapped.
I'm gonna run trace on the clothes, see if I can't find a transfer from Darius-- we'll keep you in the loop.
appreciate it. I had my lab send up information on the bullet we extracted from Lydia Johnson.
Lydia Johnson, that's the Florida murder that Darius tried to pull off as his own.
Yeah, that's, um...
a promise of information got him out of prison, but it turns out the bullet is pointing to someone else, someone named Rosie.
Yeah, we got your information on the bullet.
nine millimeter, probably a Glock.
I'm running it through local and state databases, as we speak.
I'll check its progress.
are you this hot on every case?
well, I made a promise to an eight-year-old boy, and I'm not gonna let him down.
say no more.
got your call.
team's all here.
great, thanks.
we came as soon as we could.
what's with all the pills?
it's a pharm party.
what's a pharm party?
pharmaceuticals.
empty your parents' medicine cabinet, and pop until you drop.
rich kids' idea of fun.
at first glance, I've got lithium, sertraline, fluoxetine.
most of these drugs don't even get you high.
Stella and I are gonna run with this one.
Danny, check the service entry area.
there's an elevator there.
a secondary exit.
Sheldon, bag up these bottles.
get them over to Lindsay
she'll be in Trace. Okay.
sir, I've worked big crime scenes before.
I've got two hands, I'm ready to work.
this is a high-profile case, Lindsay.
I want you in the lab.
I need your full attention.
and, remember, anything we find here can take us to Darius.
be careful, be thorough.
just finished bagging the script bottles.
you got something?
Yeah, multicolored fiber, caught in the elevator gate, so I'm thinking one of these kids tried to escape.
it's possible. Let's get all this over to Lindsay.
read my mind.
what do you got, Montana?
Danny, stop calling me that, it's "Lindsay.
all right, all right, I'm just joking.
well, it's not funny.
am I supposed to be the new girl and the butt of all of your jokes?
you upset that Mac dismissed you?
I can handle it.
it's not about that, he was looking out for you.
you saw that place, it was a slaughterhouse in there.
what, you think I haven't seen blood like that before?
I don't know, tell you the truth.
have you?
Yes.
and a lot worse than that.
here, take a look.
what do you think? The one on the left is a fiber from the gate, the one on the right was taken from one of the dead girls' uniforms.
looks like a match to Hathaway Prep.
Yeah, except none of the victims had a tear in their skirt consistent with the fiber on the gate.
so one of the girls got away.
all right, keep these fibers in play, 'cause we got to find that schoolgirl.
ripped uniform?
from Hathaway Prep?
Yup.
any suggestions on a lead?
we found her younger sister, Sarah.
we're pulling her out of school, Hathaway Prep.
she's on her way to the precinct.
I think I know where to start.
I can't believe this happened to my sister.
can I see her, please?
ms. Endecott, I think it's best that we wait till your parents are with you.
you know, it never quite made sense to me that your classmates were in your house, but you weren't.
no, I told you, I-I had class, so I gave them the key.
ms. Endecott, would you stand up, please?
Why?
how'd you rip your skirt?
okay, I was there.
it was a pharm party.
but I must have been in the pantry or something when my sister came home, 'cause I never heard her arrive, and I never knew she was even in the house.
why didn't you come forward with this information when my detective picked you up at school?
I don't know. I just didn't want to get in trouble, okay? I'm sorry.
sit down.
here.
why don't you tell me what you remember?
okay, well...
whatever I took, I got... I got dry mouth, so I went to the pantry to get some more water and some vodka.
DALTON: Where's Alexa?
DARIUS: I want everybody to get on the ground.
you said you weren't going to hurt us!
he shot Paige!
and I went back to school.
I just tried to pretend it was all a dream.
you're lucky to be alive, you know that?
yeah...
got your page.
you're going to like this.
Oh, really?
that's a stria match.
Yeah, and the bullets are lining up like the Rockettes at Christmas.
check this out.
Albert Grafton, nickname "Big Al,
used the same weapon that killed your Lydia Johnson,
there you have it. Let's go.
I'll drive.
after you.
thank you. Yeah.
parking structure's across the street. Sounds good.
Yeah.
you've been served.
sign here, please.
these guys are worse than the paparazzi.
I have my own pen.
listen, I get named on these things all the time.
our union attorney's great, if you want me to give you his number.
this is a matter outside the job.
sorry.
I have a number of memories up here, not all are good.
so, I apologize.
um...
let's go get Al.
HAWKES: Hey, Mac?
I ran the script bottles
I collected from the Endecott house.
couple of Endecotts:
Tom, Paroxetine;
Alexa, Zolpidem.
zolpidem?
Alexa was taking a sleeping aid?
Yeah. Who's the family doctor?
a Dr. Feldstein.
Yeah. That name ring a bell?
he testified in Henry Darius' competency hearing murder of three nurses in Midtown.
he determined that Darius was sane enough to stand trial.
this is big, right? Huge.
you just found the connection between Darius and Alexa.
detective Taylor, NYPD.
this is Detective Flack.
we're here to see Dr. Feldstein right now.
he's with a client.
you can't go in.
the yellow light means he's mid-session.
session's over.
we're here about a murder.
detective Taylor, NYPD.
your, uh...
yellow light was on.
Where's your client?
uh, I had a cancellation.
I needed some quiet time to do my bills.
doctor, uh, how many times did you meet with Henry Darius?
Why?
did you reveal any information about Alexa Endecott at that meeting?
no-- that would be against the law.
Darius targeted Alexa Endecott in Florida, brought her back to her parents' home where he robbed and killed her.
uh, what does that have to do with...
doctor, you're the only point of intersection between killer and victim.
either you're an accomplice or you were duped.
all right, I may have unwittingly mentioned some of my clientele.
unwittingly.
now, how are you supposed to judge my competency, when you work for the county?
you see, I have a private practice that includes some of the most notable names in Manhattan.
have you heard of the Buchenwalds?
that's impressive.
sounds like Darius out-psyched the pysch.
what else did you tell him?
I may have mentioned that Alexa would have come into $3 million on her 21st birthday.
you told a convicted killer that?
well, come on, he was going away for life.
I mean, what was he going to do with that information?
you'd be surprised.
what's that?
I cut myself shaving.
I cut myself shaving, it's nothing.
he was here, wasn't he?
he came in the "out" door.
he told me that if I gave him up, he'd kill me.
Henry Darius was just here?
he was just here, yes.
Flack! Outside-- scaffolding!
show me your hands!
turn around!
slowly!
he put a gun in my mouth.
made me take my coveralls off, put this hat on.
found these on the roof of the building.
he's probably long gone by now.
I wonder if that could be the window washer's.
the washer doesn't put these on till he's at work.
now, why would he make a mistake like that?
he left this on purpose.
he wants a meeting.
a four-digit code on the back, hand written.
that's the lead car number.
I think Darius wants me to catch the same train as him.
where? That's what I'm gonna find out.
good afternoon.
Albert Grafton works here, correct?
he's security.
he's over by the chocolate fountain.
thank you.
at my club.
something happen I don't know about?
you were involved in a shooting four months ago at a club in Tribeca.
security detail.
it was self-defense.
judge dismissed the case.
Where's that gun now, Albert?
I don't know.
Albert, here's what I want you to do.
very slowly...
I want you to open your jacket.
do it.
well, Horatio, that looks like our nine-millimeter Glock.
same gun that killed Lydia Johnson, Albert.
I don't know no Lydia Johnson.
BONASERA: Well, striations from the bullet put your gun at her murder, back in Florida.
Hey, I bought that gun off some guy off in Union Square.
when?
about a year ago.
okay, that's the same time she was killed, my friend.
this man look familiar to you?
answer the question or she's going to hook you up.
he looks a lot like the guy that sold me the piece
ponytail, mouth.
his eyes were more narrow set.
he had a bump on his nose, just underneath the ridge.
you have an amazing memory.
I work security, dawg.
it's my job to remember faces.
well, that's great, because I need every detail.
that's right, dawg.
Caine: How are we doing?
uh, Big Al's got a world class memory.
PIMS program will start comparing mug shots in a second.
did you check out his story?
I did. He was in Japan working security with some big rapper the week Lydia was killed.
customs confirmed it for me.
so, his story holds? Yeah.
so, somebody...
somebody killed Lydia Johnson in Florida, and then sold Big Al the gun in New York.
all right, here we go.
just gonna put in the PIMS data.
Latino male, 30 to 35, brown hair, brown eyes, 175 to 200 pounds.
over a hundred hits.
think we need to pare this down a little bit.
big Al said that he had narrow-set eyes and a lump on his nose, right?
Yes, he did.
and then there's the ponytail.
that's your Rosie.
Yes. Did time in Attica.
same time as Darius.
well, if Darius got information from the shrink, you can bet that he got information from a convict. I agree.
let me check his current status.
got off on parole two days ago.
his parole officer will know where he works.
in the meantime,
I'm gonna get this to Al and double confirm it, all right?
good. All right. No problem.
Hey, hey.
watch where you're going!
thank you.
you're quite the gentleman.
detective Taylor.
I'm impressed you went through all the trouble.
you've been busy, Henry.
here, Miami.
you said you'd help me.
you offered me a deal if I confessed.
those three nurses in Midtown.
I sat in your interview room, and I told you everything.
except why.
I was hoping you'd tell me.
you're the only one who knows I can't control it.
that's why I came alone.
I want you to come with me.
I want to.
next stop, you and me.
I can't.
DARIUS: Who you gonna take care of now, huh, me or him?
NYPD. Everyone stay calm.
it's under control.
sir, tell the conductor to shut down right away.
CSI Detective Taylor to Central.
I have a male stabbed, heavy bleeder, on the train just west of the Woodside Station on the subway.
need an ambulance right away.
Flack told me that the guy on the train is going to be okay.
rescue stabilized him. He was lucky.
lucky you were there.
never mind that. I got every man in blue out looking for Darius. Full-court press.
this is the manhunt of the decade right here, right now. I hear you. See this face?
I'll check in with you later, Mac. Where you headed?
got a lead on the guy that was in Attica with Darius.
he works at a parking garage on Fifth.
I'll keep you posted.
looks important.
this is the fiber from inside the vault.
TAYLOR: It's synthetic.
okay. Ripstop nylon with a polyurethane coating.
probably some kind of protectant.
against weather.
so, we're talking gym bag, backpack, some kind of carrier.
exactly.
the eyewitnesses who remember seeing Darius enter the building with Alexa said neither of them was carrying a bag.
fiber's telling us that somebody else was there.
Danny's on the biometric lock.
we'll find out who.
here you go, sir. Thanks.
Where's Vincent Rosetti?
he parks cars here.
Hey, Vincent.
woman: I'm ready. What are you doing?
I'm in a hurry. Vincent, don't do it.
midtown traffic's a killer.
Caine: Vince Rosetti, you're under arrest for the murder of Lydia Johnson.
and that's just the charge in Florida.
selling your weapon in Union Square to a stranger, Vincent?
that wasn't too bright, was it? No way.
been in Attica the last six months on a stolen property bid.
Yeah, we know. That's where you met up with Henry Darius.
so, I was in lockdown with him. Big deal.
Caine: On the contrary,
Vincent. It is a big deal.
great.
a lockdown could take hours.
my name's Rosie.
Henry Darius? Wow, man.
I heard about you on the news.
you killed those nurses.
allegedly.
Yeah, I killed someone once.
tell me about it.
open your mouth.
open your mouth.
do it.
I got an urgent message. What's up?
we got a discrepancy in the timeline. Okay.
Yeah, I been working on this biometric palm analyzer.
all right, take a look.
safe was opened at 1: 30 p. m.
consistent with the time of the murders.
but I checked earlier in the day.
it was also opened up at 10: 30 a. m.
that's a half hour before Darius landed at Teterboro.
hence, my urgent message. There's no way Darius could have opened that safe the first time.
so, it's possible somebody else took the money out of the safe before Darius and Alexa got there.
give me a second, and I will tell you who.
Endecotts loaded the safe up with approved palm prints.
the little sister.
let's have Homicide bring her in.
I told you guys, I've never been to Florida.
well, witnesses say otherwise.
100 guys could look like that.
100 guys don't have your DNA, Vince, which we matched to the shovel that you used to bury Lydia in Miami.
the key word here is "match.
first, you shot her, and then came back here to New York and sold the gun.
but the striations followed you, Vincent.
let's go, Vince.
let's hear it... right now.
squirrelly little Eminem wannabe in Fort Lauderdale paid me.
wanted to scare the husband.
I end up with the wife.
scream and I'll blow your head off.
what do you want?
drive.
how'd you go from scaring to murder?
the broad started to fight me.
I was just going to drive her around a couple hours 'til her husband played some song.
she grabbed the gun.
it went off.
she made the first move.
Oh, don't even blame her for what you did.
she was driving crazy, bleeding everywhere.
screaming... I had to shut her up.
so you put a bullet in her temple.
it worked.
it worked...
Where's Darius, Vincent?
beats me.
I haven't seen him since that day after lockdown.
could I have a word with you, please?
Yeah.
I would really love first crack at this guy.
right, Mrs. Johnson's son.
I get it. Look, as long as he's off the streets, it's fine with me.
fair enough.
it's Mac-- he's got something on Darius.
I'll catch up.
sounds top secret.
it was top secret, Vincent.
so I want you to be the first to know that you are returning to Florida.
cool-- I like the sun.
Yes, well, you won't get to see very much of it, Vincent, because we enforce the death penalty.
checked on the whereabouts of Sarah Endecott.
she's not at the house or the school, or anywhere in between. TAYLOR: That's what we figured.
we switched over to Plan B.
Yeah, no girl ever leaves her house without her cellphone.
at least, not at that age.
TAYLOR: GPS the phone number.
got it.
Tiffany's... now you're talking my language.
you can tell from a map?
BONASERA: You kidding?
I could tell from the moon.
I love those little blue boxes.
let's go.
um, hi... Detective Taylor.
BONASERA: A little retail therapy?
that's one way to get over the loss of your sister.
may I take a peek?
let's see...
nice.
$8, 000... and she spent cash.
well, it's my...
it's my money,
I can use it however I want.
how'd you rip your backpack?
we found red fibers from a backpack in your parents' bedroom.
by the safe. I thought you never went in there.
I-I don't... I don't know...
I hardly ever do.
this is pretty heavy.
mind if I open it?
it's a lot more than just "walk-around" money, even for an Endecott.
you were in the house to steal the money.
the pharm party was just a ruse.
Sarah: Well, the plan was: have some friends over, party...
and I'd take the money while they were there.
and if the cops got wind, I'd have an alibi.
this doesn't look like the full three million.
you couldn't have spent all this today.
Mr. Endecott, we're doing everything humanly possible to put this animal behind bars.
where were you, Sarah?
Sarah's in a lot of trouble, sir.
she failed to notify authorities after fleeing the scene of a murder, robbery...
wait, wait, wait, wait, slow down.
Sarah didn't steal the money.
I told her she could take it from the safe.
TAYLOR: With all due respect, sir, I happen to know that the money was for Alexa.
I know all about the trust fund.
money was for Alexa on her 21st birthday.
coming from money, kids can end up with no ambition...
no drive.
I told them they stayed clean and sober, at 21, they'd get three million to do as they see fit.
Lex was going to start a day care down in Florida.
she was the one who loved kids.
her whole life was in front of her.
perhaps your youngest daughter stole the money because she knew that she'd never pass the clean and sober clause.
I lost one daughter today.
I'm not gonna lose another.
I told Sarah she could take the money.
you should know, sir, that we only found half the money.
Where's the other half?
who have you got mixed up with this time?
I'm sorry, you can't go in there. He's in a meeting.
we don't want him.
warrant, with your name on it.
Where's the money?
Sarah gave you up.
huh.
end of the year bonus?
Hey, could we do this somewhere else?
no.
these walls are insulated.
how'd you get access to Alexa's therapy sessions?
I type the notes from every one of Dr. Feldstein's sessions.
transcribed a session Alexa had three years ago, talking about her lump sum, how it'd come due.
I feel so guilty.
you know, I'm getting all this money and my sister won't get a penny.
and you knew Sarah was the black sheep of the family.
parents sent Sarah in a few times, but it didn't take.
she spent most of her time on the phone with me, canceling appointments.
and you became friendly.
well, I knew when Alexa would get her money.
marked it in my calendar.
when the time came,
I called Sarah.
I had the info, she had the access.
Sarah: $3 million? Where?
your parents' safe.
look, all I want is half.
I'm the Endecott here.
why should I give you anything?
because if you don't, I'll go to the cops.
Oh, and point the finger at me, right?
okay, deal.
you're aware that when Darius found the safe empty, he killed Alexa, aren't you?
no, I... I wasn't aware of that.
well, you'll have plenty of time to think about it
20, 25 years.
put your hands behind your back, please.
you're taking a ride.
heard there was a break in the case.
Stella already has you on speed dial.
thought you had to duck out on personal business.
I got an extension.
good news for both of us.
TAYLOR: Blood evidence from Alexa's crime scene?
Oh, yes, gentlemen, I found something very interesting.
I compared reference samples from Alexa Endecott to Henry Darius.
they're related.
related?
they are brother and sister.
also ran the references from the Endecott parents.
Mrs. Endecott is unrelated, but Tom Endecott is Henry Darius' father.
well, that changes everything.
we think Endecott knows this?
I'm gonna have Flack look into a paternity suit in his past. The question becomes, who's the target, Endecott or his other daughter?
we had to release Sarah.
I better GPS her.
worked once.
I'll try and track down Endecott.
come again?
Henry Darius is your biological son.
this killer, you can't be serious.
Mr. Endecott,
DNA doesn't lie.
look... as a young guy, I sowed my share of wild oats.
did you know you had a son out there?
ENDECOTT: I vaguely remember a girl years ago telling me she had a son, claimed it was mine.
actually, it was more than just a memory.
filed a paternity suit against you 23 years ago claiming her son was yours.
the doctors couldn't prove anything.
there was no DNA testing back then.
I'd met my wife by then.
we were starting our own family.
Oh, my God.
is that why he killed Alexa?
I'm beginning to think all the women he killed were stand-ins for your daughters.
he told you this?
he doesn't understand it himself.
BONASERA: See, getting Alexa's trust fund money meant he was a legitimate heir.
when the money wasn't there, he responded with rage.
my daughter Sarah, is she in danger?
we have concerns about that. Darius said he came to New York to make things right.
my God.
who is it?
DARIUS: Open the door, sis.
Where's Alexa's money?!
it's gone.
I want you to know who I am.
I'm your biological brother.
open the door.
you do what I say, I won't hurt you.
I promise.
come on in, Darius.
step away, Sarah.
turn around.
put your hands on your head.
you're under arrest.
it's all over.
nice job.
our pleasure.
want to hop in a squad?
I'll take you red lights to LaGuardia.
that's all been arranged.
but do me a favor, and give my best to Stella, will you?
I'll see you, Mac.
Adam: Hello?
Hey, Adam. It's Lieutenant Caine.
listen, I've got some news for you.
I got him and I'm bringing him back to Miami.
I'm sorry, Lieutenant. Hey, buddy, wait a second.
you never need to apologize to me.
I'm here and I'm not going anywhere.
I'm not going anywhere.
you'll be extradited back to Miami after we file on you here in New York.
do you know what's wrong with me?
I'm not a shrink.
better than Dr. Feldstein, I'll tell you that.
thank you.
for everything.
pardon?
this may sound crazy to you, Detective Taylor, but you fought for me.
chased me all over Manhattan.
that's my job.
but you came looking for me.
and that's more than my father ever did.
you think if he'd acknowledged me
I wouldn't have done the things that I did?
it's not for me to decide.
that's between you and your own personal god.
me-- I don't pity you, Darius.
there's a lot of people with worse stories than yours.
they never hurt anyone.
you killed 12 people in two states over the last 72 hours, and you want me to feel sorry for you because your daddy didn't kiss you when you were a baby?
you asked for my help-- I did help you.
you're where you belong.
you rot in hell, you son of a bitch.
two nights ago, in Miami...
Hey, look at that plane!
let's flash them.
Yeah! - It's on fire!
dude, swerve!
Oh, my...
you okay?
don't!
don't, please don't.
he's on a killing spree in Miami.
please... - Shh...
I shot her.
Where'd you bury her body?
I took care of it.
you don't understand.
look in that guy's eyes...
...It's too late.
that younger woman is a hostage.
let the girl go.
Oh, not yet.
he told me he was going to New York City to make things right.
he's not gonna stop until we make him stop.
could I die from this?
that's the fun.
so what's it like to grow up with all this money?
what are you gonna do to me?
Oh, first things first.
go.
you said nobody'd be home.
nobody's supposed to be here.
you trying to set me up?
no, no, really.
Hey, look who's here.
Hey, everybody, it's Alexa.
I thought you were in Miami.
um, where's my sister?
I am so high.
sorry.
Alexa, you promised to show me your bedroom.
will you excuse us?
make all the noise you want.
open it.
I didn't fly you a thousand miles for nothing.
give me your hand.
double-crossed me?
no, I didn't...
Oh, my God, Dalton.
you're bleeding.
it's not mine.
Where's Alexa?
Oh, my God.
I want everybody to get on the ground face down, hands behind your back.
now.
you do what I say, I won't hurt you.
I promise.
you said you weren't gonna hurt us!
how did this happen?
there were security guards at every one of the Endecotts' Manhattan properties.
he's got to be here somewhere.
we sure this is Darius?
take a good look at the position of these kids.
look familiar?
Yeah.
those nurses in Midtown.
he played in their blood.
any one of these kids Alexa Endecott?
she never saw it coming.
no.
safe is open and empty.
it's a biometric lock.
explains why he brought her to New York.
needed her hand, her blood vessels.
why would he bring Alexa all the way to New York for money?
thought he got money from the groupie in Florida.
it's not Endecott money.
and, as we know, money is only half of it.
last thing Darius said down in Miami:
he was coming to New York to make things right.
think he has?
not even close.

《 Manhattan Manhunt 》
Darius is in the wind.
I got a broadcast out,
tri-state area.
the M. E.'s office finished bagging the last kid.
Alexa's next.
we found her younger sister, Sarah.
we're pulling her out of school, Hathaway Prep.
she's on her way to the precinct.
parents?
on their way back from Australia.
it's obvious he targeted Alexa for money, but why her?
we're not finding evidence of any previous connection between her and Darius.
then we'll work with current connections.
I need this lock taken back to the lab.
I'll get the company out here ASAP.
room's been sealed, right?
Yeah, to the man.
red fabric.
from inside the vault.
make sure this gets to Trace.
I'll stay with the body till the M. E.gets up here.
all right.
guard on duty?
Yeah, M. E. says that his neck was snapped.
I'm gonna run trace on the clothes, see if I can't find a transfer from Darius
we'll keep you in the loop. - Appreciate it.
I had my lab send up information on the bullet we extracted from Lydia Johnson.
that's the Florida murder that Darius tried to pull off as his own.
Yeah, that's, um...
a promise of information got him out of prison, but iturnsut the bullet is pointing to someone else, someone named Rosie.
Yeah, we got your information on the bullet.
nine millimeter, probably a Glock.
I'm running it through local and state databases, as we speak.
I'll check its progress.
are you this hot on every case?
well, I made a promise to an eight-year-old boy, and I'm not gonna let him down.
say no more.
got your call.
team's all here.
great, thanks.
we came as soon as we could.
what's with all the pills?
it's a pharm party.
what's a pharm party?
pharmaceuticals.
empty your parents'medicine cabinet, and pop until you drop.
rich kids' idea of fun.
at first glance,
I've got lithium, sertraline, fluoxetine.
most of these drugs don't even get you high.
Stella and I are gonna run with this one.
Danny, check the service entry area.
there's an elevator there.
a secondary exit.
Sheldon, bag up these bottles.
get them over to Lindsay
she'll be in Trace. - Okay.
sir, I've worked big crime scenes before.
I've got two hands,
I'm ready to work.
this is a high-profile case, Lindsay.
I want you in the lab.
I need your full attention.
and, remember, anything we find here can take us to Darius.
be careful, be thorough.
just finished bagging the script bottles.
you got something?
Yeah, multicolored fiber, caught in the elevator gate, so I'm thinking one of these kids tried to escape.
it's possible.
let's get all this over to Lindsay.
read my mind.
what do you got, Montana?
Danny, stop calling me that, it's "Lindsay.
all right, all right,
I'm just joking.
well, it's not funny.
am I supposed to be the new girl and the butt of all of your jokes?
you upset that Mac dismissed you?
I can handle it.
it's not about that, he was looking out for you.
you saw that place, it was a slaughterhouse in there.
what, you think I haven't seen blood like that before?
I don't know, tell you the truth.
have you?
Yes.
and a lot worse than that.
here, take a look.
what do you think?
the one on the left is a fiberfrom the gate, the one on the right was taken from one of the dead girls' uniforms.
looks like a match to Hathaway Prep.
Yeah, except none of the victims had a tear in their skirt consistent with the fiber on the gate.
so one of the girls got away.
all right, keep these fibers in play, 'cause we got to find that schoolgirl.
ripped uniform?
from Hathaway Prep?
Yup.
any suggestions on a lead?
we found her younger sister, Sarah.
we're pulling her out of school, Hathaway Prep.
she's on her way to the precinct.
I think I know where to start.
I can't believe this happened to my sister.
can I see her, please?
ms. Endecott, I think it's best that we wait till your parents are with you.
you know, it never quite made sense to me that your classmates were in your house, but you weren't.
no, I told you,
I-I had class, so I gave them the key.
ms. Endecott, would you stand up, please?
Why?
how'd you rip your skirt?
okay, I was there.
it was a pharm party.
but I must have been in the pantry or something when my sister came home, 'cause I never heard her arrive, and I never knew she was even in the house.
why didn't you come forward with this information when my detective picked you up at school?
I don't know.
I just didn't want to get in trouble, okay?
I'm sorry.
okay. Okay.
sit down.
here.
why don't you tell me what you remember?
okay, well...
whatever I took,
I got... I got dry mouth, so I went to the pantry to get some more water and some vodka.
Where's Alexa?
I want everybody to get on the ground.
you said you weren't going to hurt us!
he shot Paige!
and I went back to school.
I just tried to pretend it was all a dream.
you're lucky to be alive, you know that?
yeah...
got your page.
you're going to like this.
Oh, really?
that's a stria match.
Yeah, and the bullets are lining up like the Rockettes at Christmas.
check this out.
nickname "Big Al,
used the same weapon that killed your Lydia Johnson, - four months ago. - There you have it.
let's go. - I'll drive.
after you. - Thank you.
Yeah.
parking structure's across the street. - Sounds good.
Horatio Caine? - Yeah.
you've been served.
sign here, please.
these guys are worse than the paparazzi.
I have my own pen.
listen, I get named on these things all the time.
our union attorney's great, if you want me to give you his number.
this is a matter outside the job.
sorry.
I have a number of memories up here, not all are good.
so, I apologize.
um...
let's go get Al.
Hey, Mac?
I ran the script bottles I collected from the Endecott house.
couple of Endecotts:
Tom, Paroxetine;
Zolpidem. - Zolpidem?
Alexa was taking a sleeping aid? - Yeah.
who's the family doctor?
a Dr. Feldstein.
Yeah.
that name ring a bell?
he testified in Henry Darius'competency hearing
murder of three nurses in Midtown.
he determined that Darius was sane enough to stand trial.
this is big, right?
huge.
you just found the connection between Darius and Alexa.
detective Taylor, NYPD.
this is Detective Flack.
we're here to see Dr. Feldstein right now.
he's with a client.
you can't go in.
the yellow light means he's mid-session.
Sessionn's over.
we're here about a murder.
detective Taylor, NYPD.
your, uh...
yellow light was on.
Where's your client?
uh, I had a cancellation.
I needed some quiet time to do my bills.
doctor, uh, how many times did you meet with Henry Darius?
Why?
did you reveal any information about Alexa Endecott at that meeting?
no
that would be against the law.
Darius targeted Alexa Endecott in Florida, brought her back to her parents' home where he robbed and killed her.
uh, what does that have to do with... - Doctor, you're the only point of intersection between killer and victim.
either you're an accomplice or you were duped.
all right, I may have unwittingly mentioned some of my clientele.
unwittingly.
now, how are you supposed to judge my competency, when you work for the county?
you see, I have a private practice that includes some of the most notable names in Manhattan.
have you heard of the Buchenwalds?
van der Griffs?
Endecotts?
Endecotts.
that's impressive.
sounds like Darius out-psyched the pysch.
what else did you tell him?
I may have mentioned that Alexa would have come into $3 million on her 21st birthday.
you told a convicted killer that?
well, come on, he was going away for life.
I mean, what was he going to do with that information?
you'd be surprised.
what's that?
I cut myself shaving.
I cut myself shaving, it's nothing.
he was here, wasn't he?
he came in the "out" door.
he told me that if I gave him up, he'd kill me.
Henry Darius was just here?
he was just here, yes.
Flack! Outside
scaffolding!
show me your hands!
turn around!
slowly!
he put a gun in my mouth made me take my coveralls off, put this hat on.
found these on the roof of the building.
he's probably long gone by now.
metrocard.
I wonder if that could be the window washer's.
the washer doesn't put these on till he's at work.
now, why would he make a mistake like that?
he left this on purpose.
he wants a meeting.
a four-digit code on the back, hand written.
that's the lead car number.
I think Darius wants me to catch the same train as him.
where?
that's what I'm gonna find out.
good afternoon.
Albert Grafton works here, correct?
he's security.
he's over by the chocolate fountain.
thank you.
5-0.
at my club.
something happen I don't know about?
you were involved in a shooting four months ago at a club in Tribeca.
security detail.
it was self-defense. Judge dismissed the case.
Where's that gun now, Albert?
I don't know.
Albert, here's what I want you to do. Very slowly...
I want you to open your jacket.
do it.
well, Horatio, that looks like our nine-millimeter Glock.
same gun that killed Lydia Johnson, Albert.
I don't know no Lydia Johnson.
well, striations from the bullet put your gun at her murder, back in Florida.
Hey, I bought that gun off some guy off in Union Square.
when?
about a year ago.
okay, that's the same time she was killed, my friend.
this man look familiar to you?
answer the question or she's going to hook you up.
he looks a lot like the guy that sold me the piece
ponytail, mouth.
his eyes were more narrow set.
he had a bump on his nose, just underneath the ridge.
you have an amazing memory.
I work security, dawg.
it's my job to remember faces.
well, that's great, because I need every detail.
that's right, dawg.
how are we doing?
uh, Big Al's got a world class memory.
PIMS program will start comparing mug shots in a second.
did you check out his story?
I did. He was in Japan working security with some big rapper the week Lydia was killed.
customs confirmed it for me.
so, his story holds? - Yeah.
so, somebody...
somebody killed Lydia Johnson in Florida, and then sold Big Al the gun in New York.
all right, here we go.
just gonna put in the PIMS data. Latino male, 30 to 35, brown hair, brown eyes, 175 to 200 pounds.
over a hundred hits.
think we need to pare this down a little bit.
big Al said that he had narrow-set eyes and a - lump on his nose, right? - Yes, he did.
and then there's the ponytail.
that's your Rosie. - Yes.
did time in Attica. Same time as Darius.
well, if Darius got information from the shrink, you can bet that he got information from a convict.
I agree.
let me check his current status.
got off on parole two days ago.
his parole officer will know where he works.
in the meantime, I'm gonna get this to Al and double confirm it, all right?
good. All right. No problem.
watch where you're going!
thank you.
you're quite the gentleman.
detective Taylor.
I'm impressed you went through all the trouble.
you've been busy, Henry.
here,
Miami.
you said you'd help me.
you offered me a deal if I confessed.
those three nurses in Midtown.
I sat in your interview room, and I told you everything.
except why.
I was hoping you'd tell me.
you're the only one who knows I can't control it.
that's why I came alone.
I want you to come with me.
I want to.
next stop, you and me.
I can't.
who you gonna take care of now, huh, me or him?
NYPD. Everyone stay calm. It's under control.
sir, tell the conductor to shut down right away.
CSI Detective Taylor to Central. I have a male stabbed, heavy bleeder, on the train just west of the Woodside Station on the subway.
need an ambulance right away.
Hey. - Hi.
Flack told me that the guy on the train is going to be okay.
rescue stabilized him. He was lucky.
lucky you were there. - Never mind that.
I got every man in blue out looking for Darius. Full-court press.
this is the manhunt of the decade right here, right now.
I hear you. See this face?
I'll check in with you later, Mac. - Where you headed?
got a lead on the guy that was in Attica with Darius.
he works at a parking garage on Fifth.
I'll keep you posted.
looks important.
this is the fiber from inside the vault.
it's synthetic. Okay.
ripstop nylon with a polyurethane coating. Probably some kind of protectant.
against weather. So, we're talking gym bag, backpack, some kind of carrier.
exactly.
the eyewitnesses who remember seeing Darius enter the building with Alexa said neither of them was carrying a bag.
fiber's telling us that somebody else was there.
Danny's on the biometric lock. We'll find out who.
Where's Vincent Rosetti? He parks cars here.
Hey, Vincent.
I'm ready. What are you doing?
I'm in a hurry. - Vincent, don't do it.
midtown traffic's a killer.
Vince Rosetti, you're under arrest for the murder of Lydia Johnson.
and that's just the charge in Florida.
selling your weapon in Union Square to a stranger, Vincent?
that wasn't too bright, was it?
no way.
been in Attica the last six months on a stolen property bid.
Yeah, we know. That's where you met up with Henry Darius.
so, I was in lockdown with him. Big deal.
on the conary, Vincent. It is a big deal.
great.
a lockdown could take hours.
my name's Rosie.
Henry Darius? Wow, man.
I heard about you on the news.
you killed those nurses.
allegedly.
Yeah, I killed someone once.
tell me about it.
open your mouth.
open your mouth!
do it.
I got an urgent message. What's up?
we got a discrepancy in the timeline. - Okay.
Yeah, I been working on this biometric palm analyzer. All right, take a look.
safe was opened at 1: 30 p. m.
consistent with the time of the murders.
but I checked earlier in the day.
it was also opened up at 10: 30 a. m.
that's a half hour before Darius landed at Teterboro.
hence, my urgent message.
there's no way Darius could have opened that safe the first time.
so, it's possible somebody else took the money out of the safe before Darius and Alexa got there.
give me a second, and I will tell you who.
Endecotts loaded the safe up with approved palm prints.
the little sister.
let's have Homicide bring her in.
I told you guys, I've never been to Florida.
well, witnesses say otherwise.
100 guys could look like that.
100 guys don't have your DNA,
Vince, which we matched to the shovel that you used to bury Lydia in Miami.
the key word here is "match.
first, you shot her, and then came back here to New York and sold the gun.
but the striations followed you, Vincent.
let's go, Vince. Let's hear it... right now.
squirrelly little Eminem wannabe in Fort Lauderdale paid me.
wanted to scare the husband. I end up with the wife.
scream and I'll blow your head off.
what do you want? - Drive.
how'd you go from scaring to murder?
the broad started to fight me.
I was just going to drive her around a couple hours 'til her husband played some song.
she grabbed the gun. It went off.
she made the first move.
Oh, don't even blame her for what you did.
she was driving crazy, bleeding everywhere.
screaming... I had to shut her up.
so you put a bullet in her temple.
it worked.
it worked...
Where's Darius, Vincent?
beats me.
I haven't seen him since that day after lockdown.
okay, Vince. Stella...
could I have a word with you, please?
Yeah.
I would really love first crack at this guy.
right, Mrs. Johnson's son. I get it.
look, as long as he's off the streets, it's fine with me.
fair enough.
it's Mac
he's got something on Darius. - I'll catch up.
sounds top secret.
it was top secret, Vincent.
so I want you to be the first to know that you are returning to Florida.
cool-- I like the sun.
Yes, well, you won't get to see very much of it, Vincent, because we enforce the death penalty.
checked on the whereabouts of Sarah Endecott.
she's not at the house or the school, or anywhere in between.
that's what we figured. We switched over to Plan B.
Yeah, no girl ever leaves her house without her cellphone. At least, not at that age.
GPS the phone number. - Got it.
Tiffany's... now you're talking my language.
you can tell from a map?
you kidding?
I could tell from the moon. I love those little blue boxes. Let's go.
um, hi... Detective Taylor.
a little retail therapy?
that's one way to get over the loss of your sister.
may I take a peek?
let's see...
nice.
$8, 000... and she spent cash.
well, it's my...
it's my money, I can use it however I want.
how'd you rip your backpack?
we found red fibers from a backpack in your parents' bedroom.
by the safe. I thought you never went in there.
I-I don't...I don't know...
I hardly ever do.
this is pretty heavy. Mind if I open it?
okay.
it's a lot more than just "walk-around" money, even for an Endecott.
you were in the house to steal the money.
the pharm party was just a ruse.
well, the plan was:
have some friends over, party...
and I'd take the money while they were there.
and if the cops got wind, I'd have an alibi.
this doesn't look like the full three million.
you couldn't have spent all this today. Where's the rest of the money?
Mr. Endecott, we're doing everything humanly possible to put this animal behind bars.
where were you, Sarah?
Sarah's in a lot of trouble, sir.
she failed to notify authorities after fleeing the scene of a murder, robbery...
wait, wait, wait, wait, slow down.
Sarah didn't steal the money.
I told her she could take it from the safe.
with all due respect, sir, I happen to know that the money was for Alexa.
I know all about the trust fund.
money was for Alexa on her 21st birthday.
coming from money, kids can end up with no ambition...
no drive.
I told them they stayed clean and sober, at 21, they'd get three million to do as they see fit.
Lex was going to start a day care down in Florida. She was the one who loved kids.
her whole life was in front of her.
perhaps your youngest daughter stole the money because she knew that she'd never pass the clean and sober clause.
I lost one daughter today. I'm not gonna lose another.
I told Sarah she could take the money.
you should know, sir, that we only found half the money.
Where's the other half?
who have you got mixed up with this time?
I'm sorry, you can't go in there. He's in a meeting.
we don't want him. Warrant, with your name on it.
Where's the money?
Sarah gave you up.
end of the year bonus?
Hey, could we do this somewhere else?
no.
these walls are insulated.
how'd you get access to Alexa's therapy sessions?
I type the notes from every one of Dr. Feldstein's sessions.
transcribed a session Alexa had three years ago, talking about her lump sum, how it'd come due.
I feel so guilty.
you know, I'm getting all this money and my sister won't get a penny.
and you knew Sarah was the black sheep of the family.
parents sent Sarah in a few times, but it didn't take.
she spent most of her time on the phone with me, canceling appointments.
and you became friendly.
well, I knew when Alexa would get her money.
marked it in my calendar.
when the time came, I called Sarah.
I had the info, she had the access.
$3 million? Where?
your parents' safe. Look, all I want is half.
I'm the Endecott here. Why should I give you anything?
because if you don't, I'll go to the cops.
Oh, and point the finger at me, right?
okay, deal.
you're aware that when Darius found the safe empty, he killed Alexa, aren't you?
no, I... I wasn't aware of that.
well, you'll have plenty of time to think about it
20, 25 years.
put your hands behind your back, please.
you're taking a ride.
heard there was a break in the case.
Stella already has you on speed dial.
thought you had to duck out on personal business.
I got an extension.
good news for both of us.
blood evidence from Alexa's crime scene?
Oh, yes, gentlemen, I found something very interesting.
I compared reference samples from Alexa Endecott to Henry Darius.
they're related.
related?
they are brother and sister.
also ran the references from the Endecott parents.
Mrs. Endecott is unrelated, but Tom Endecott is Henry Darius' father.
well, that changes everything. We think Endecott knows this?
I'm gonna have Flack look into a paternity suit in his past.
the question becomes, who's the target, Endecott or his other daughter?
we had to release Sarah.
I better GPS her.
worked once. I'll try and track down Endecott.
come again?
Henry Darius is your biological son.
this killer, you can't be serious.
Mr. Endecott,
DNA doesn't lie.
look... as a...
as a young guy, I sowed my share of wild oats.
did you know you had a son out there?
I vaguely remember a girl years ago telling me...
...she had a son, claimed it was mine.
actually, it was more than just a memory.
filed a paternity suit against you 23 years ago claiming her son was yours.
the doctors couldn't prove anything.
there was no DNA testing back then.
I'd met my wife by then. We were starting our own family.
Oh, my God.
is that why he killed Alexa?
I'm beginning to think all the women he killed were stand-ins for your daughters.
he told you this?
he doesn't understand it himself.
see, getting Alexa's trust fund money meant he was a legitimate heir.
when the money wasn't there, he responded with rage.
my daughter Sarah, is she in danger?
we have concerns about that.
Darius said he came to New York to make things right.
my God.
who is it?
open the door, sis.
Where's Alexa's money?!
it's gone.
I want you to know who I am.
I'm your biological brother.
open the door.
you do what I say, I won't hurt you.
I promise.
come on in, Darius.
step away, Sarah.
turn around.
put your hands on your head.
you're under arrest.
it's all over.
nice job.
our pleasure.
want to hop in a squad?
I'll take you red lights to LaGuardia.
that's all been arranged.
but do me a favor, and give my best to Stella, will you?
I'll see you, Mac.
Hello? - Hey, Adam.
it's Lieutenant Caine.
listen, I've got some news for you.
I got him and I'm bringing him back to Miami.
I'm sorry, Lieutenant. - Hey, buddy, wait a second.
you never need to apologize to me.
okay?
I'm here and I'm not going anywhere.
I'm not going anywhere.
you'll be extradited back to Miami after we file on you here in New York.
do you know what's wrong with me?
I'm not a shrink.
better than Dr. Feldstein, I'll tell you that.
thank you.
for everything.
pardon?
this may sound crazy to you, Detective Taylor, but...
...you fought for me.
chased me all over Manhattan.
that's my job.
but you came looking for me.
and that's more than my father ever did.
you think if he'd acknowledged me
I wouldn't have done the things that I did?
it's not for me to decide.
that's between you and your own personal god.
me
I don't pity you, Darius.
there's a lot of people with worse stories than yours.
they never hurt anyone.
you killed 12 people in two states over the last 72 hours, and you want me to feel sorry for you because your daddy didn't kiss you when you were a baby?
you asked for my help
I did help you.
you're where you belong.
you rot in hell, you son of a bitch.
give me the rock.
no, no, no, no.
driver's side window on that truck.
right there. Too easy, man.
Hey!
think he's a little ticked off?
he stupid punks, get back here! I saw you!
doll: That tickles!
doll 2: Do you wanna play?
doll 3: I'm Riley!
Oh, my God!
do you wanna play?
I'm Riley.
you're special.
MESSER: Wow.
now it is spooky.
welcome to New York City's Premiere Doll Hospital.
I lived here my whole life.
I never knew a place like this exited.
you never broke an arm off your G. I. Joe?
Yeah, but I did it on purpose.
it was a casualty of war.
TAYLOR: Who's our vic?
Russell McCulley. He owns all of this.
and the kid?
he literally stumbled onto our vic and then called 911. Somebody sliced his hand good.
sliced right through the radial artery.
MESSER: I got something here.
TAYLOR: Arterial spray.
he was cut there.
direction of the bod pattern says he stumbled back to here, grabbed for the shelves.
and it all came tumbling down.
more than likely, died of shock before he completely bled out.
why kill this guy?
MAC: Doesn't appear to be a robbery.
cash is still in the register.
none of the dolls are missing, as far as we can tell.
and no sign of forced entry.
although, the kid did say that it was open.
TAYLOR: "Closed" sign is in the window.
I imagine the vic flipped the sign, but didn't get a chance to lock the door.
left hand is clenched, still holding on tight.
quick and extreme rigor.
something at this little doll was worth dying for.
Dr. McCulley usually stays after hours, mostly to catch up on paperwork.
we close at 6: 00.
doctor
we try to make it like a real hospital.
we have admission and release forms, visiting hours.
it's for the kids.
when they drop off their broken dolls, we want them to feel like we'll take good care of them.
anything special about the doll that was in his hand?
Nurse: Secret Sofie.
she was admitted yesterday afternoon.
I believe the door repaired her.
I can get you the paperwork, Detective.
miss Felton, can you think of any reason why someone would want to kill Dr. McCulley?
no.
any disgruntled customers, former employees?
maybe he was having problems at home with the family.
the smallest thing could help.
uh... one lady returned her antique doll several times.
she was unsatisfied with the work, but that was months ago.
uh... more recently, the doctor filed a complaint with WorldSend.
the parcel delivery service?
some of the dolls we repair come from rest of state.
we carefully package them and send them back.
but lately, we've been getting calls.
the items inside we broken.
was Mr. Culley married or in a retionship?
Holessly single.
although, there were a lot of women in his life.
were you one of them?
no.
I wasn't that lucky.
excuse me.
possible suspect?
no, I'm focused on the boxes behind him.
they have WolrdSend overnight labels.
all are unopened, and the one on the bottom appear to have been wet.
looks like it absorbed water from the bottom up.
possibly from the snow.
someone delivered those boxes last night.
no ligature marks, lacerations.
no abrasions.
no bullet wounds.
no apparent external injuries, whatsoever.
I've got several nondescript capsules and a half glass of water.
but nothing that tells me whether these are barbiturates or vitamins.
possible O.D.
it's certainly not suicide.
this is a "To do" list dated for tomorrow.
if you're gonna kill yourself, why would you waste your time planning to pay bills and do laundry?
she was a waitress.
yeah?
how do you afford this a dress on a waitress' salary?
is it me, or is she smiling?
some souls find peace with death.
Yeah.
this isn't her glove.
Hey.
when Lauren didn't answer the door, I became concerned.
we've only been neighbors for eight months, but I-I feel like I've known her forever.
I-I know this sounds silly, but something just didn't feel right.
you know?
so I-I called the doorman.
you didn't assume she was at work or out running an errand?
yesterday, she told me she wasn't feeling well and would spend today in bed.
are you okay?
Oh, Dale, it's terrible. What? What?
Lauren's gone.
She's-she's dead.
what? What happened?
FLACK: This is Detective Bonasera.
I'm Dective Flack.
uh, Dale Straker.
detectives?
I'm sorry, this is a homicide?
all sudden and unexpected deaths are investigated.
of course.
Oh, um, you told them about the argument, right?
no, I mean, it was nothing, really.
yesterday, we heard some voice coming from Lauren's apartment.
I don't know, but it sounded like it got pretty heated.
about what time was this argument?
just after 5: 00, I think.
could you tell what they were arguing about?
no, it's not that.
it was the tone of the conversation that was disturbing... to me, at least.
it ended with a door being slammed.
was the other voice male or female?
female, definitely.
a very angry female voice.
I'm sorry.
look, before you start into a really moving story about how badly you need your package, I can't help you, okay?
I'm not allowed to pull anything off the truck.
I got to deliver it to the address on the box.
I'd like to talk to you about Russell McCulley.
his doll hospital is on your delivery route.
Yeah, I know him.
you were there last night?
I can't believe he called you.
what, now it's a crime to tell someone to mind their own business?
depends on how you told him.
I suppose he said I threatened him.
well, he accused me of being careless with his packages.
he called my supervisor.
I get one more complaint, and I lose my job.
so, yeah, I got a little mad, and I got in his face about it.
and then what?
I left.
did you leave by the front door or the back?
I didn't catch your name.
detective Taylor. Crime Scene Investigator.
which door?
I went out the back door.
every evening, same thing.
park my truck in the alley.
I get in, get out, get on with it.
it says "Fragile"-- I've had enough of you treating my boxes.
Yeah, yeah.
but the point is, I don't appreciate the accusation, okay?
the door locks automatically behind me.
did something happen?
Russell McCulley's been murdered.
what?
what time was your delivery?
late. It was my last stop.
I'd say 6: 30, quarter to 7: 00 .
after closing.
other than Russell McCulley, was there anyone else in the hospital when you were there?
no.
anybody see you go in or out?
no.
like I said, it was late.
how mad were you, Rhonda?
not mad enough to kill him.
now, unless you're out to tell me that I have the right to remain silent.
I have to get back to work.
excuse me.
um, I'm Harry Ellis, the next-door neighbor.
we were wondering how long would all this take?
most of the activity will settle down in a couple hours, but it's gonna remain a crime scene.
Oh.
Mr. Ellis, were you home yesterday around 5: 00?
Yes.
did you, uh, did you hear an argument coming from Ms. Redave's apartment?
I heard something, but, like I said to the officers, I've learned to tune out the noises.
so it'll probably be a whole week or so before they can list the apartment on the market?
Yeah, we usually don't let the realtors show a place until we get the link of death out of the carpeting.
just thought I ask.
and the attitude is unnecessary.
HAMMERBACK: Stomach cancer.
HAWKES: So it was as it appeared, hair loss due to chemotherapy.
only 28 years old.
this type of cancer rare in someone so young, but it does happen.
however, despite its advanced stage, it wasn't our cause of death.
our COD was respiratory failure.
I can see the discoloration on the lungs.
it's very gray here and here.
surface hard and rubbery?
Yes, Doctor.
there's a degree of damage to the organs due to the cancer as well as the chemo treatments.
so there's very little that I can conclude until we get the results back from tox..
precisely.
BONASERA: How much time did she have?
in regards to the cancer.
three to four months.
I wonder if she knew that.
Thanks, Sid.
maybe we should revisit the idea of suicide.
or assisted suicide.
she might have wanted to end it on her own terms.
she had every healthy food, cancer cure product available in her home.
no, it didn't look to me like she was giving up the fight.
I think Lauren Redgrave really wanted to live.
my name is Sooo... fie...
right. Mac...
I checked our doll fobridden drugs, cash, treasure maps.
anything that would tell us why our vic held on so tight.
and the verdict?
zero. I have no clue why this doll was so important to him.
any blood other than the vic's?
negative. All we got is a bad voice box.
and Lindsay just take it over to the AV.
so we find out who owned Secret Sofie.
you're having as much fun with your doll as I've had with mine.
Yeah. You have that shard you pulled from the vic's hand?
Yeah.
this little doll's arm is our murder weapon.
cheap Styrofoam.
somebody grabbed it when the soup was still hot.
Flack. Yeah, yeah.
it's always about the black glove.
Yeah, it's connected to the soup.
I'm getting a little hungry for lunch.
meet me there?
uh... I mix a little bit of rat poison with scrambled eggs.
gets them every time.
sorry you guys had to see that.
two for lunch?
no. Ah, no. Thank you.
I just need to ask you a couple questions. Could you tell me who made a delivery last night to 837 W. 57th Street?
sure. That was me.
great. Could you raise your right hand, please?
we found your glove.
three days ago, she was supposed to cover for me.
she didn't show.
I got fired.
we got into it over the phone.
I felt bad, so I went to see her.
did she explain why she didn't shown up?
she said she was sick.
that's why I brought her the soup.
and that was definitely a mistake.
how's that?
she accused me of trying to kill her.
I don't want it. It's poison.
it's soup, Lauren. It's your favorite.
you're sick, you should eat something.
there's pesticides in the vegetables.
they use chemicals to manufacture Styrofoam and it seeps into the food.
and the meat is from chickens that are injected with hormones. What is wrong with you?
I don't want to die!
Lauren, what are you talking about?
get out!
just get out!
you have lost your mind.
I'd never seen her like that before.
did you bring Lauren anything other to eat than the soup?
no.
all right.
thank you.
Darcy: Hey.
you didn't say how she died.
HAMMERBACK: Arsenic poisoning.
it's your cause of death.
Yeah.
and we can rule out the capsules we found at the scene.
they were nothing more the a collection of organic supplements.
there was no poison detected in the soup.
so that means we'll need to go back to the apartment and to every food and ingestible item that's there.
historical examination of the organs indicates chronic poisoning.
okay. Usually I can tell the number of weeks, but because our victim lost her hair, we don't have a sufficient sample to determine an accurate timeline.
which would help us narrow down a list of suspects.
who was in her life at the time of the poisonings?
you know, I used to date a lovely young lady who shed quite a bit.
my point being, when you return to the victim's apartment, you might want to gather a few hairs from the shower drain.
I imagine she didn't wear her wig while bathing.
and any long blond hairs in the din would be from her, most likely when she started to lose her hair.
right.
Angthing, Hawkes?
suspicious about everything and sure of nothing.
that's the truth.
you hear tt?
wow, he's good.
Yeah.
really good.
you know, I don't think Lauren told anybody about her cancer.
the Strakers didn't mention it.
and it was obvious that Darcy hadn't heard about it.
that's a tough thing to go through by yourself.
Oh. Must have been such a hard blow.
now I understand why she went to bed with her wig and makeup on.
what if she died in her sleep?
she wanted to look beautiful.
Yeah, and she did.
hmm.
Hey, Hawkes, come here.
take a look at this. Top of the tea bag.
very top.
staple's been moved.
removed.
this one, too.
okay, we got something here.
Hey, Hawkes?
Yeah.
the tea bags we tainted with arsenic, iron, metal, sulfide and olivine.
none of these are listed as ingredients on the tea bag box.
and the last four components create meteorite dust.
meteorite dust.
I don't make this stuff up.
Oh.
well, why is it in the tea bags?
the unanswered question. I know that they collect this dust from craters here on Earth.
it predominately used in golf clubs.
it's odd, and unexplainable, but it's not lethal.
it was the arsenic that killed Lauren Redgrave.
and the results of the atomic absorption test on her hair says she's been slowly poisoned over the last seven months.
this poison was found in tea bags that anybody could pick up at an upscale drugstore.
you're thinking product tampering?
I'm thinking maybe this is a lot bigger than Lauren Redgrave.
I dropped the doll off yesterday, late afternoon after my faculty meeting here at school.
is there anything special about your daughter's doll?
um, to Abby, Sofie was very special, but other an that, no.
why'd you take the doll to the doll hospital?
Abby explained , Sofie's mouth would move, but the sound wouldn't come out. Has she had the doll for a while?
over a year.
man: Miss Drake, these are the last boxes.
thank you, boys.
Luke, don't forget-- tutoring on Monday.
and Jason, expect your art history homework first thing.
ms. Drake we checked the doll hospital's phone records.
Mr. McCulley called you last night? Yes, he left a message on my voice mail.
I could pick up the doll anytime was ready.
but right now, I do have to pick up my daughter.
sure. Thank you.
monroe: Thanks.
maybe this isn't about the doll at all.
maybe he just used it to defend himself.
grip was way too tight.
you ever been to the scene of a shooting where the vic's hand is actually frozen in place?
you can actually take the gun... slide it right into the palm.
perfect fit.
that means he was struggling with his attacker for the gun.
saw thing happened here.
you know? You hungry?
no, I got to get back to the lab.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, me, too.
me, too.
monroe: This is no ordinary doll.
pretty expensive... not very many made, but her big selling point is that she can keep a secret.
the owner of the doll can record a message...
a secret... and then play it back again.
I've been tinkering with it...
girl's VOICE: I saw them kissing again.
th time, they were naked, and I saw everything.
they kept saying things like, "Ooh, touch me there. That feels good.
it was a bad touch. Shh...
it's a secret.
sounds like she cought two people in a compromising position.
the doctor fixed the doll and heard the secret.
do you murder somebody over it?
depends on who was getting compromised.
go back to the top.
I saw them kissing again.
this tim they were naked and I saw everything.
they kept saying things like... Wait, go back.
...and I saw everything. They...
pull up the back the backgrnd: I saw them kissing again.
this time, they were naked and I saw...
that's some kind of a bell.
this little girl saw something in her elementary school?
I guess we won't know until we ask her.
Abby, Sofie told me that you two have a secret.
do you want to tell me what it is?
no. I don't think she would like it.
I'm sure Sofie wouldn't mind.
I don't think so.
secrets are like promises.
and you have to keep them.
ms. DRAKE: I'm sorry. She won't tell me, either.
I tried on the way over here.
it's okay, sweetie.
you're being very good.
Abby, I promise you won't get in trouble.
no one's going to get mad.
in fact, nobody even has to know that you've told me.
you can tell me.
no, I can't.
the good news-- only one box was tainted.
the box in Lauren Redgrave's apartment.
the bad news, Harry, is this little price tag.
it tells me that the box came from your store.
so someone tampered with my products.
and it's just a coincidence at your next-door neighbor bought the only tainted box?
I didn't poison her.
did you know your price tag stamp could be identified much like a gun?
it leaves a very specific identifying mark.
unique only to that stamp. No other stamp has it.
this is all very interesting but why would I kill her?
we asked ourselves the same question.
and you know what?
you had already given me the answer.
you were interested in her apartment.
do you hear what you're saying?
that I'd kill somebody for a space?
it's a closet.
with a view. Maybe knock the wall down that separates your apartment from hers.
wasn't that your plan eight months ago, Harry?
I... I have no idea what you're talking about.
well, then let me take you back to the beginning.
you see, we couldn't figure out how Lauren Redgrave could afford that apartment on a waitress' slary, so we did some research.
and what we learned was the previous owner, George Milfy, left it to his favorite waitress in his will.
that must have really pissed you off.
you know what? Yeah, I did.
we're a co-operator.
and we search potential tenants.
those are the rules, and George Milfy broke them from his grave.
well, who knew his will would supersede the rules?
I didn't kill her.
I wouldn't do that.
I don't murder people.
that little girl was a tough cookie.
I couldn't get any more information.
when we recovered the doll at the scene it wasn't working.
but the nurse said McCulley had repaired it.
so it must have been damaged gain in the struggle.
if the doll doctor heard the same message we did, he might have believed that Abby witnessed something inappropriate.
that would explain the phone call he made to Abby's mother that night.
but it's not the kind of thing you leave on somebody's voice mail.
but the fact remains the doctor held on to that doll.
somebody wanted it because they knew what was on it.
Hey, that swatch you cut from the doll's clothing, anything on it?
salt... potassium acetate, which is consistent with the stuff that they use to melt the snow and ice out on the streets.
that leaves the print on the murder weapon.
no match in any database.
okay, go back to it, dig deeper.
we need to find something that gets us to our killer.
you're going to have to do more than just stare at it.
I'm waiting for it to talk to me.
Ah, then you might want to buy it a drink first.
this is all we got on our case.
and you know what Mac says, right?
dig deeper. Dig deeper.
you remember the Hutchinson murder?
Bleecker Street?
oily print.
Yes, I do.
if it's not the print itself, maybe it's something in the print.
exactly.
thank you.
Stella, I heard your vic had cancer, huh?
Yeah. Sad. It's very sad.
get that done, okay?
all right.
what are you doing?
you don't got to do that.
I was taught if you show someone a little respect you might get more than what you came for.
you, uh, play good cop, I'll be bad cop.
I'm going to keep my shoes on.
guess you didn't grow up with hardwood floors.
no, I didn't, actually.
Bronx marble.
what's it?
it's linoleum.
ms. DRAKE: One second.
MESSER: So, we found a fingerprint on the murder weapon that killed Mr. McCulley.
also we found traces of a substance called rhodium on that same fingerprint.
what does that have to do with me?
we saw you loading jewelry into your car the other day, Ms. Drake.
rhodium is used to plate white gold.
you obviously know something about jewelry plating.
actually it's about the physics of art.
one of my new classes.
I'm teaching my students to take ordinary pieces of costume jewelry and turn them into extraordinary works of art.
I think this ordinary fingerprint that we found on the murder weapon... might belong to you.
I'm sure it does.
when I dropped off Abby's doll, Mr. McCulley was helping another customer.
while I was waiting, I was fidgeting with the arm of a broken doll that was sitting on the counter.
I hope you don't imprison people based on such pedestrian evidence.
how did yoou know it was the arm we were talking about?
detective Messer simply said the print was found on the weapon that killed the victim.
well, it must be what you were referring to.
it was the only thing on the counter when I was there.
where were you on the night of the murder, Ms. Drake?
are you suggesting that I'm a suspect is death?
you didn't awerer my question.
I was at a PTA dinner.
MESSER: You got a phone number of someone that can confirm that?
Absolutely.
thought you were going to play good cop.
there's something about that woman.
Yeah, I know. She had all the answers, huh?
Yeah.
let's see if she has an answer for is.
it's a rush. Okay.
MESSER: I intercepted our DNA results.
the blood on the eye all you found in Monica Drake's hallway?
yeah? It matches to Russell McCulley.
you're making me nervous, Mac-- you got that look.
what look is that? That one that says, we're not quite finish; cancel your plans for the evening.
the doll's eye was outside Monica Drake's apartment, which puts Mr. McCuly's killer in her building.
wait, I'm confused-- it sounds to me like you're saying that the killer is somebody other than Monica Drake.
her alibi was confirmed-- she was nowhere near the doll hospital at the time of the murder.
but Mac we found the eyeball outside the door.
outside, Lindsay.
defense attorney will argue it's a hallway where anyone has access.
we got rhodium on a print and the vic's blood on the eyeball.
I'd say that's enough to get a search warrant.
so let's find something inside the apartment, preferably the doll doctor's blood.
Monica Drake knows the killer.
looks like Ms. Drake's been quite busy.
mo semen samples here than a fertility clinic.
what do you get?
it's kind of a white powder.
there's more on the floor.
seems kind of out of place, considering how clean the rest of the apartment is. That's great, but we need blood-- not anything?
not a drop.
there it is.
TAYLOR: See it?
the windows.
MESSER: There's snow.
window on the left and the window on the right have the same drift pattern.
Yeah, and the snow on the center window's disturbed.
somebody climbed through that window.
we got salt.
MESSER: Same as on the doll dress.
our killer entered the doll hospital from here.
I don't know, Mac, there's no fire escape ladder, there's not even a dumpster-- how's he get from down here to up there?
it means, if that result's correct, we're looking for somee from the Knicks. No.
we're looking for Rhonda.
at least, it's circumstantial evidence.
you know, we can connect Ellis to the teas and motive, but we can't prove he poisoned Lauren Redgrave.
and since he didn't get confession, that don't add up to much.
let's just go back to Darcy Sullivan.
rat poison is arsenic, and we did find traces of arsenic in her glove.
Yeah, but when did she have access to that particular box of tea, and what's her motive?
and why would anyone poison someone who was already so close to death?
they didn't know she had cancer.
(DOOR opens) HAWKES: I answered the unanswered question.
BONASERA: Really? Yes.
with a violin?
this is gonna be good.
now, I want you guys look right here, okay?
they use it to coat bows of string instruments-- it makes the tone better.
exactly.
sometimes metals are added to rosin to create different tonal qualities.
one of those metals is meteorite dust.
the unexplained ingredient in our tea bag.
wait a minute, this is not just about a room with a view, is is about space.
gentlemen, we have a right motive, just the wrong neighbor.
Oh, you really are a brilliant musician, Mr. Straker.
thank you. Mm.
but a very patient killer.
arsenic poisoning over the last seven months.
right after Lauren Redgrave inherited the apartment from George Miley.
no. You've got the wrong person. No, no, we had the wrong person-- see, your neighbor, Harry Ellis, he was our first suspect.
just knocking down the wall between his and Lauren's apartment, he gains a view.
but your plan was for a nursery.
that's why you killed her, right?
you don't understand-- Lauren Caron and I were like family.
guess that's what made it so easy to execute the poisoning.
tell me something, Dale, did you ever put arsenic in any other food?
then maybe Carol made a casserole, took it over to Lauren's house?
you used your wife and Lauren's friendship to gain access to Lauren's apartment, food........
look, this is crazy-- look, I did not poison Lauren Redgrave.
Oh. But you did.
BONASERA: See, rosin's very messy-- it gets sticky, sticks on your hands, gets underneath your fingernails.
you didn't even think about that when you were putting your arsenic in the tea bags, did you?
I-I want to, uh, to my lawr. Good.
you can explain to him what sealed your fate.
it's always the easiest things.
there you go-- Lauren's "To Do" list:
pay bills, do laundry, and, oh, "Give Dale $95."
the price of a box of tea.
Oh, um, Mr. Straker?
just wanted to let you know, Lauren had terminal cancer.
she only had three month to live.
so, this is where I parked it, just left of the door.
gives me plenty room to load and unload.
salt.
that's how salt on the shoe.
yo, Mac, I think I've seen this before.
thank you, boys.
Luke, don't forget about tutoring on Monday.
looks like we've got trace.
TAYLOR: She told you to break into the doll hospital? That's not how it happen.
ms. Drake had nothing to do with this.
come on, Luke.
she sent you there to steal the doll, isn't that right?
Hey! What are you doing? Give me the doll!
but you messed up-- you were only supposed get the doll, not kill Russell McCulley.
it was an accident! A terrible accident!
I mean, he should've just given me the doll.
you panicked...
so you went to her.
I think he's dead!
Where's the doll? I'm in trouble, I didn't get it.
you've gone this all wrong.
the secret your daughter was keeping was yours.
she walked in on you... tutoring Luke Fier.
mommy, you all right?
MONICA: Yeah, that feels good.
mom? Mommy?
Abby... sweetie, go to bed.
and you asked her to keep it a secret, right?
but she decided to share it with someone, someone she trusted.
saw them kissing again.
this time they were naked, and I saw everything.
she kept saying things like, "Ooh, touch me there, that feels good."
that was a bad touch.
it's a secret.
Abby, cookies are ready.
MESSER: The bell we heard came from your kitchen.
you would have never known about it if the doll hadn't been broken and the doctor hadn't heard the secret.
that's why he made that call to you the other night, cause he was concerned.
ABBY: she kept saying things like, "Ooh, touch me there, that feels good."
McCULLEY: I just thought you should hear that.
Abby has such a vivid imagination.
she would've told if she saw something like that at school.
I'll pick up the doll tomorrow
why'd you do it, Luke?
if people found out, they wouldn't let us be together.
now, I got a secret for you.
no one knew that what Abby witnessed... was you and Luke Fisher.
there's nothing on that tape that says it was you.
ABBY: I saw them kissing again.
this time they were naked, and I saw everything.
to anyone else, that could sound like... two high school kids going at it behind the bleachers.
but to your guilty conscience, it sounded just like what it was: you and a teenager.
does it matter at all that I love him?
okay, boys, who wants Kandy?!
pick me, please!
man: Pick me, pick me!
come on!
D. O.A. is Joanna Kelton, stage name Kandy with a K.
she's a featured stripper here.
who found her?
manager, Andy Kula.
his girls hang out in the alley between sets.
he came out here looking for Kandy, and he found her like this.
he give us anything else?
Yeah, he said the vic was lube wrestling earlier in the evening with an overly aggressive customer.
he got thrown out of the club.
he's not a regular here, and nobody got his name.
TAYLOR: Careful.
that light's 1, 000 degrees, burn your eyes.
Scagnetti, get somebody to turn this light off.
signs of a struggle.
same shade of lipstick.
so the vic comes out here to have a smoke...
someone attacks her...
and it's lights out.
just in time.
you want to get that side?
how horrible.
that end.
ready?
Yeah.
extensive burn trauma.
skin's reddish brown.
take her over to Dr. Pino for official C. O.D.
all right. Take the light with you for processing.
Lindsay, you're inside with me.
might be something in there we can use to I. D. the customer our vic was wrestling.
well...
let me know if you find anything.
I'll get my boots.
MESSER: I just can't believe it.
two years have gone by,
I haven't heard one word.
and out of the blue, Louie leaves me a message.
he says, "I'm in the city. Want to grab a beer?"
could only mean trouble.
Ah, Danny, he's your brother.
cut him some slack.
I know, you're right.
but if not trouble, he's probably looking for a handout.
why don't you just call Louie back,
I mean, before assuming the worst.
whether it's really a beer he wants or he needs your help.
after all, he is family.
throat slashed with a knife.
MESSER: You sure that's him?
Yep, that's him.
billionaire recluse.
the Howard Hughes of the computer industry.
there was a picture of him in the paper last year.
actually, it was more like a composite.
rumor is, he didn't get out much.
I got some pills here.
sertraline.
our vic was
I got a blood trail.
is it just me, or is this bedroom kind of giving you the creeps?
no windows. That is kind of weird.
know what? You stay with the vic, I'm gonna go find Flack.
he caught this one. See what he knows.
housekeeper was the first to arrive for work this morning.
she says she walked in and found her boss dead.
my boys swept the area.
no signs of forced entry.
this place is tighter than Fort Knox.
who's the guy Linda's with?
it's Roger Hagler. He's a bodyguard.
he just showed up.
all right, who else has access to this house?
Dr. Lyle Penn, Hunter's personal physician.
he works here out of the house.
he's late today. That's it?
no butler? No.
too bad. I thought we could wrap this one up quick.
what?
mansion like this, it's always the butler.
didn't you ever play Clue?
I was a Monopoly guy.
Ah. All right.
big money always comes with enemies.
let's make a few phone calls, find out who stood to gain from Hunter Hudson's death.
that was fast.
funny how a little lube speeds up the processing.
wedding ring, male.
what about you?
found blood.
and this.
our vic was cheating on someone.
we may have a motive.
what's cooking?
John Doe.
nice teeth.
Dr. Sheldon Hawkes, the man we all want to be when we grow up.
how's the field work, Sherlock?
never a dull moment.
tan's fading.
but then there's always spray-on when I start looking like the inventory.
well, glad you're back.
giants jersey?
you know it. Mm-hmm.
what did we find on our burn victim.
I found antemortem defensive bruising, which means that she got into a fight just before she was killed.
your official C. O.D?
severe burn trauma caused by contact with the klieg light.
I did find something you might like.
this is interesting.
Oh...
tattoo on the inner thigh means eyes only, means our vic had a lover.
you're thinking lovers' spat?
things got a little heated?
literally.
you got a camera?
Hawkes is sending us a picture.
our vic had artwork.
heart, with a letter "A" in the middle of it.
wasn't the manager's name Andy?
Dr. Penn, what were you treating Mr. Hudson for?
was he sick?
hunter suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and O. C.D.
medication and daily hypnotherapy helped him to cope.
so the stories are true.
what, that Hunter was crazy?
20 years ago, he suffered a severe emotional trauma.
his younger brother was kidnapped and murdered.
and it was something he never really recovered from.
all right, well, thank you, Doctor.
please, whatever I can do.
hypnotherapy.
when you're rich enough, you try things.
hold on a sec.
that's not good.
what the...?!
What...?
Hey!
Hey, Danny, can you hear me?!
you kidding me?
it's called a panic room.
it's like a bank vault for homes.
Mr. Hudson built his bedroom inside of it.
it was his sanctuary.
staff weren't allowed inside.
he had security issues.
how do we open it?
I'm afraid Mr. Hudson was the only one who had the security code.
well, that's beautiful. I can see you guys.
Hey, Danny. All right, look, there's got to be another way to get in the room. This is the only door.
Mr. Hudson had it preset to close at 9: 00 p. m. and reopen again at 9: 00 a. m. when the staff arrived.
is that the time you got here?
no, 9: 30.
I usually arrive early to prepare breakfast, but I stopped at the market this morning.
you're telling me that this spaceship doesn't open up again till tomorrow morning?
it doesn't open, period.
you just said he had it preset to open at 9: 00 a. m.
that's under normal operating conditions.
once the panic button is hit, the room thinks an intruder is inside.
it will not reopen until the security code is entered.
how many numbers in the code?
I have no idea.
this is getting better and better.
I'm not spending a week in here with a crazy dead guy trying to figure out the code.
so, do me a favor, call the locksmith.
he built the room for Mr. Hudson.
I'll find him.
Thanks, Flack.
okay, well,
I'm going to start processing out here.
Danny, we've got it under control.
help is on the way.
I'll be in here.
you said Kandy got into an altercation with a customer last night. That's right.
creep would've killed her if I didn't throw him out.
what about you?
looks like he wasn't the only one to get physical.
look, half my night's spent hauling drunks out of here on their asses, Detective.
this is all I go home with, it's a good night.
what?
Oh, you think I killed Kandy?
you're jumping the gun there, Andy.
all I asked you was how you got that fat lip.
and I told you, okay?
it gets kind of messy in here sometimes.
what about in Kandy's dressing room?
if I run the blood I found and it matches your DNA, what's the story going to be then?
Yeah, okay? I was in her dressing room, okay?
Kan... Kandy and I were close.
close enough to have your initial tattooed on her inner thigh?
whoa, whoa, whoa. That was there way before I came along.
tell me about the fight you had.
she was cheating on me.
Yeah. I saw that online.
so when you found this, you were surprised, you got angry, you confronted Kandy and things got out of hand.
define your definition of "out of hand," Detective?
murder.
not even close.
why should I believe you?
look, obviously you never been in here on a night when a stripper isn't killed;
the place is wall-to-wall honeys.
I do all the hirings and firings,
I got the pick of the litter.
saves on the wining and dining.
look, all I'm saying is, you're right,
I didn't like her playing behind my back.
but I didn't kill her.
wouldn't even waste my time.
we'll talk again.
BONASERA: Hey, Danny?
you find something?
Yeah.
I've got a blood trail that strangely seems to lead to the sink first, then the phone.
maybe the housekeeper got sick, went to the sink.
there's an awful lot of blood in here.
I got short strides. Tells me she wasn't running.
she knew Hunter was dead. What's the rush?
then she probably checked for the pulse.
I don't know.
this blood pool looks undisturbed.
there are no signs that she checked for vitals.
okay, Linda finds her boss in a pool of blood, yet doesn't check to make sure he's dead.
and then she takes her time to call the police.
she's got my attention.
cavalry's here. This is Jerry Gordon.
his company built Mr. Hudson's panic room.
Hallelujah.
unfortunately, there's no master code that can override the system.
only way in here is if I cut a new door.
how long is that going to take?
minimum, 13 hours.
MESSER: Excuse me?
thirteen hours?
Yeah, I'm gonna have to shut down this power to do it.
the backup generator will kick in when I pull the plug, but it's only got limited power.
forget fresh air circulating.
these vents aren't hooked up to any kind of auxiliary power feed.
that's beautiful.
might get a little toasty in there.
I suggest you conserve your oxygen.
fantastic.
excuse me. Yeah.
BONASERA: Hey, Danny?
you got to start processing in there right now.
process? With what?
I don't have a kit.
I know. You're going to have to improvise.
you heard what Jerry said, it's going to get hot in there.
if you don't start now, that body's going to decay further and we're going to lose evidence.
we can't let the killer get a head start.
Stella's been calling every half hour with updates.
I have a city engineer reviewing blueprints of the room to see if there are any other points of entry.
so just stand by, I'll keep you informed.
okay.
is he going to be all right?
they have a locksmith cutting a new door.
how long is that going to take?
they estimate 13 hours.
what do you know?
I went through the data on Kandy's computer.
found her last bit of Internet activity.
she was logged onto "cheats-on-you. com"
there's her picture in the list of cheaters.
who outed Kandy?
according to the IP address on the submission, it came in about a week ago from Kandy's computer.
but the e-mail address belongs to a woman named Angie Charles.
how long were you and Kandy lovers?
a little over two years.
monroe: These are beautiful.
those were from a freelance shoot in South America a few months ago.
I take it these were from a different assignment?
female nudes are what I'm known for.
when was the last time you saw her? Last week.
what about last night?
I was at home.
alone.
look, it was a bad breakup.
I wish there was more I can tell you.
the last time I saw Kandy, she was here, she packed some boxes, she split.
we barely spoke.
you asked her to move out?
Angie: 'Cause she was moving on.
some guy at the club she stripped at.
that's right.
and so you posted her picture on cheats-on-you. com for revenge.
buyer beware.
Kandy was a gold-digger.
I just wanted her next lover to know all the facts.
I gave her everything she wanted...
and she burned me.
and someone did the same to her.
all right, I got the vic's clothes off.
first thing I want you to do is visually examine the entire body.
and then describe to me the nature and location of all the wounds and abnormalities.
MESSER: Got a flashlight.
lucky for you you're not claustrophobic.
me? I do not like confined spaces.
why'd you choose a career that puts you in windowless rooms with dead bodies, then?
ladies love the degree.
they don't ask specifics.
six years of med school to become a player, huh?
no, I was already a player, Messer,
I just needed the bank to pay for my Porsche.
you know what? I officially hate you right now, all right?
are you done?
Yeah.
only thing abnormal about our vic is the blood leaking from his neck.
no defensive wounds?
not that I see.
doesn't look like he fought back.
okay. Describe the neck wound to me.
no hesitation marks.
one cut, and it looks clean.
a single incised wound.
is there blanching?
I'm pushing on the lividity.
it's clearing and coming back.
your victim's been in that position for less than six hours.
let's get a more precise TOD.
you're not serious.
there's got to be a bathroom there, right?
Yeah.
be a good Boy Scout and find a thermometer.
it's your lucky day, Doc.
nice.
now plant it in the end zone and put some points on the board.
is it in?
give me a second.
Rigor's setting in.
welcome to my world.
temperature is 93.
that means your victim's been dead for four hours, rigor and lividity confirm it.
no, that's impossible. The housekeeper said this room did not open up until three hours ago.
if that's the case, then, um...
how'd your killer get inside?
everything was a blur after I found Mr. Hudson dead.
I was in shock.
I don't even remember calling 911.
were you not afraid the killer was still in the house?
why'd you stay?
my boss was lying in a pool of blood.
I guess I wasn't thinking about myself.
if you're trying to say that I had something to do with Mr. Hudson's death, you're wrong.
I loved my boss.
Wow.
newspapers made him out to be a madman.
eccentric, absolutely.
hunter was controlling.
he didn't tolerate much of anything.
no drinking.
no smoking.
no social life.
but he treated his employees fairly.
FLACK: Oh... I'll say.
we took a peek at Hunter's will.
did you know he left you a large chunk of his estate?
he told me that I would be taken care of when he died.
I had no idea...
$40 million.
rest of his employees didn't see anything close to that.
you see why we needed to talk.
I understand how that makes me look, yes.
but you say it as if I won some sort of lottery, when all that's happened is I lost a friend.
BONASERA: Hey, Danny?
our housekeeper had all the right answers.
well, maybe she's a really good liar.
Yeah.
the panic room does not open till 9: 00 a. m. yet Hunter was killed an hour earlier.
how does somebody get in a locked vault with only one door?
if Houdini were alive, we'd have our killer.
the only way to solve this puzzle is to find something in that room.
all right, what do you suggest?
let's print the knife.
now, I saw a coffee pot in there, grab that.
and see if you can find some glue.
mighty Glue.
okay, that'll do.
empty the glue into the coffee pot.
once you do that,
I want you to insert the knife and then turn the machine on.
I think I seen this on an episode of The Flintstones.
cute.
all right.
cute.
Yeah, me and my girlfriend, we downloaded the same ringer.
Eh-- speak of the devil.
MESSER: It's working.
BONASERA: All right, now we're going to need elimination prints.
pen ink will be great.
miss MacGyver?
grab your camera, I've got a foreign print.
that's it, hold that.
great.
come on, come on...
got a hit.
nice.
who is it?
know where we can find him?
Yeah. Downstairs.
I got to get out of here.
how long have you been Mr. Hudson's bodyguard? Three years.
before that, I spent 15 with the NYPD.
hmm. So, you know my service record, and we're done here.
sit down, Mr. Hagler.
I'll tell you when we're done.
you really think I would kill Mr. Hudson?
sit down!
he left you $2 million.
that gives me the right to ask you a couple of questions.
where were you this morning at 8: 00?
my apartment.
I was alone.
and last night?
I went out.
I met some friends at O'Hurley's, a cop bar in Washington Heights.
you may have heard of it?
I thought Mr. Hudson didn't allow his employees to drink.
you're right.
I broke protocol.
it was my ex-partner's birthday.
figured Mr. Hudson was in his room for the night.
couple of pops with the boys wouldn't change anything.
yet it did.
jerry: Yo, Detective, you all right?
Yeah, I'm good, thanks.
I think your phone's ringing.
Yeah, I know.
but you're not gonna answer it?
it's my brother.
I've got enough problems for one day.
Hey. Found traces of a second skin donor on the klieg light.
DNA was heat degraded.
I was only able to get amelogenin. Male.
our manager didn't have any burns.
anything else?
tree sap. Sent it down to the lab.
Hey. I find out our mystery wrestler.
I cross-referenced the inscription on the wedding ring against the credit cards used at the strip club.
came up with a name-- John Grimes.
he's on his way to Interrogation.
TAYLOR: You like strippers, Mr. Grimes?
who doesn't?
that's not what the manager of Raunch 'N Roll told me. He said you did a number on Kandy.
Oh. Other way around.
but you did hit her? I was defending myself.
you were lube wrestling.
I wouldn't call that life threatening.
all right, I was drunk.
she humiliated me.
every... Everyone was laughing.
the manager threw me out. That was it.
don't waste my time, John.
a klieg light
that's about the heat needed to put those burns on your hand.
all right...
I realized I lost my wedding ring, so I waited outside.
I figured I'd ask someone to go in and get it for me.
I heard the alley was the place the girls had their smokes, so I went out there, but she was already dead.
lying there on the light.
then how did you burn your hand?
she had some money sticking out of her bathing suit.
I took it.
I wish the whole night hadn't happened.
how much money did Kandy have on her? 500 bucks.
a phone call would have cost you 50 cents. Get up.
wait. I didn't kill her.
I don't know about that yet.
for now, I'm arresting you on grand larceny.
let's go.
Hey, Danny, I'm back. What have you got?
I think I got trace.
looks smeared.
like it could have been deposited in a scuffle.
okay. Well, we're gonna have to test it.
look around. Improvise.
the word of the day-- improvise. All right.
hello.
Oh, my.
BONASERA: What? What did you find?
is that an ear?
Yeah.
it belonged to Hunter's brother, Joshua.
20 years ago, he was taken from the house in the middle of the night.
hunter was sleeping five feet away.
kidnappers sent back the ear as proof of life.
parents paid the ransom, but the kid was still murdered.
and a few years later, his parents die in a plane crash.
left him all alone.
maybe the trace on his clothes will tell us something.
I'm gonna get started.
Yes.
all right.
I got seven lines for the unknown on the notepad and ten lines for the solvent.
okay. That means our ratio is 0. 7.
that's our RF value.
the solvent is isopropyl alcohol.
okay, and the mystery stain is...
nicotine.
all right, so, who do we like so far that smokes?
Dr. Penn.
please, whatever I can do.
ten years ago, you had your license revoked temporarily for malpractice.
did Mr. Hudson know that?
it's not exactly something that one would put on a resume, no.
Mr. Hudson was a clean freak.
and yet we found traces of nicotine on his pajamas.
see, that puts you inside the panic room.
that's right.
I came here last night to talk to Hunter.
he wanted to fire me.
Why?
he was, uh, severely depressed.
he-he wanted me to increase his dosage of Sertraline, but I refused to overmedicate.
please, Mr. Hudson, don't do this. Get out, get out.
you got to stick with the treatment you're on.
we've made great strides together. Get out, get out! Out!
out!
and that was the last time you saw Hunter Hudson?
Yes, and he was very much alive.
now, Mr. Hudson wouldn't allow his employees to smoke, and yet, you did.
hypnosis is a very powerful tool, Detective.
I bet.
what, you have the pocket watch swinging back and forth?
people get sleepy, and then do whatever you tell them to do?
the trance work that I incorporate into my sessions includes a controlled environment, and a hypnotic suggestion.
are you telling me that you made him think that you weren't a smoker?
Wow.
what else did you make him think?
I'm not sure why you're looking at me.
I'm not the only one who had contact with nicotine.
was a smoker.
I treated her a couple of months ago, using hypnosis to break the habit.
tell me what you got, Hawkes.
Hey. Take a look at this trace I found on the light.
it's actually very old tree sap.
which technically makes it amber.
you ID the black traces?
well, looks like some type of carbon containing compound.
flora maybe, trapped inside the amber.
send it down to the AMS lab. Okay.
Hey.
Hey, Danny. It's Stella.
listen, I talked to Dr. Penn.
Flack is checking out his alibi, but we have a second smoker
Linda, the housekeeper.
nice.
well, I got a body that's degrading.
and blood that's starting to clot.
wait a minute. Sertraline is an anti-coagulant.
if he was taking it, his blood wouldn't be clotting.
it does makes sense, 'cause he told Dr. Penn that his meds weren't working.
well, maybe what he was taking wasn't an anti-depressant.
exactly.
well, maybe if he was off his meds, he killed himself.
whoever swapped Hunter's pills with placeboes wanted him depressed, suicidal...
hello. Can you see me?
Yeah, you look beautiful. Now get me out of here.
few more of these, we'll be able to start cutting a new door.
couple more?!
sorry.
Hey, Danny, stay with me.
we're getting closer, all right?
remember that blue trace we found when we first arrived?
send it through.
I'm sending it through.
here it comes.
got it.
making progress. Yeah.
crime stopper, run to Ray's, grab me a slice, extra pepperoni, all right?
bring it back.
just fold it up, slide it right through, huh?
that's no way to treat good pizza, Messer.
I checked on Hagler
alibis check out.
what do you got there?
surfactant and hypochlorite.
and for those of us with just a high school diploma?
uh, soap and bleach.
laundry detergent.
someone was in a hurry.
FLACK: Is that blood?
there's only one way to find out.
it's diluted, but it definitely is blood.
Linda was trying to wash her uniform when Jerry cut the power.
find Linda Cortez.
HAWKES: Hey, Mac.
ran our amber sample through A. M.S.
carbon date came back 55, 000 years old.
from a Kapok tree.
silk cotton.
kapok was used to make blowguns in the jungles of South America.
isn't that where Angie did her photo shoot a few months ago?
MAC: Tell us about this necklace.
it was a gift.
the women in that village made it for me.
we found pieces of it on the light that killed your lover.
I wasn't even there. Well, then how'd the necklace get there? I don't know.
maybe Kandy took it.
when did you take these pictures?
this morning.
they're all out of focus.
you recently suffered a trauma
it's called Macular Edema.
1, 000 degrees ought to do it.
MAC: Kandy cheated on you, and you killed her for it.
I told you, I wasn't even there.
that's not what the pictures are telling us.
I went to the club to apologize.
she was still angry at me for posting her on that cheater's website.
we started to argue.
things... things got out of hand.
it was an accident.
I loved her.
you sure had a strange way of showing it.
give me your hands.
FLACK: Smoke?
no, thanks.
that's right. You don't smoke.
it's a nasty habit.
stains your fingers, teeth, messes with your breath.
you sure you don't want a cigarette?
I told you.
right.
I know, right.
but you told Dr. Penn you smoked.
in fact, you went to him to quit smoking.
didn't you?
got Linda in Interrogation with nothing to say.
all right.
then we'll let her uniform do the talking.
arterial spray everywhere.
Linda was standing in front of Hunter when the cut was made.
DNA confirms that the blood was his.
case closed.
not exactly.
see, if she did slice his throat, there'd be a lot more blood on her sleeve, especially given the amount of arterial spray
then how did she slice his throat?
maybe she didn't.
I'm thinking maybe Hunter did it himself.
Linda forced him to.
she hypnotized him.
that's why she went to Dr. Penn.
to learn how to hypnotize Hunter, not to stop smoking.
Mr. Hudson.
I'm gonna need you
LINDA: In a few moments, your mind and body will become more relaxed...
...concentrate on the sound of my voice... on the sound of...
but it still doesn't explain how she got into that room.
Hey, my-my phone's dying. I got half a bar.
and we have the housekeeper.
nice, nice, nice.
but I'm looking at what seems to be a secondary blood donor.
if the housekeeper doesn't have a cut on her body, she might have a partner.
know what I'm thinking?
I'm thinking you got greedy.
you got sick of taking care of Mr. Hudson, so you killed him.
no, I'm sorry.
actually, you had him kill himself.
at first, I thought it was ingenious having him commit suicide via hypnosis.
now that I see you don't have any cuts on you,
I know you had a partner.
yo.
do me a favor. Get me out of here.
I'm trying, pal. Come on.
my partner's got a suspect in custody right now.
it's going down, and I'm stuck in here, man.
Yeah, it won't be long now, I promise.
get dressed.
she stays here.
thank you.
what are you doing, man? Jerry, what are you doing?
I want you to call your partner.
tell her to let Linda go.
it's you.
it was you? Stop moving.
huh? Stop moving.
you could have opened this door this whole time!
stop moving! Huh?
stop! How'd you get that cut? Huh?
what, he fight back? He fought back, didn't he?
let me tell you something, this wack job has been wanting to kill himself for years!
years!
come time, he couldn't do it.
stop moving!
get on the phone!
all right, easy.
pick up the phone!
call your partner! Now! I will!
all right.
call your partner!
partner's right here!
leave!
now or I'll kill him!
settle down.
relax your arm! Settle down!
you all right?
Thanks, yeah.
all right. We got him.
all right, get on your feet. Come on.
Hey, what do you say we get out of here?
you got a phone I could use?
Yep.
Thanks.
I'll catch up with you. All right? No problem.
it's your brother.
you want to go grab that beer?
Yeah, yeah.
I'll grab you in an hour.
maybe the chute was sabotaged?
problem is, all our suspects are dead.
multiple compound fractures to the legs.
the impact also caused significant brain trauma, all consistent with a base jump gone bad.
and our vic was the best in the business.
Jeff Scott. 23 years old.
Madison avenue hired him to promote the upcoming real fuel games.
they picked today for the stunt 'cause the conditions were perfect.
Yeah, there was a slight change in forecast to cloudy with a chance of birds.
the pigeons weren't flying-- they dropped out of the sky like bricks.
what are we looking at here?
electrical storm?
bird flu?
poison.
according to Jo O'Keefe of animal care and control, based on the size of the crime scene and the number of birds, she believes they were flying formation, and then suddenly died at approximately the same time.
that doesn't explain all the blood that they're covered in, though.
somebody's tagged them.
these are racing pigeons.
it looks like a bloody handprint.
well, the vic's wearing gloves, so it didn't come from him.
take a look at this one.
high-velocity blood spatter, indicating a gunshot or some other violent action.
that means somewhere out there...
there's one more victim.
sweet Sixteen send this to the print lab.
I didn't think they still raised pigeons, huh?
it's become a popular sport.
these birds are athletes.
they can fly a thousand miles at 60 miles per hour and always return home.
they navigate by the earth's magnetic field.
the beak has magnetite in it.
acts like a bird compass.
I always thought these things were just flying rats.
to some, yeah.
but to others in the racing community, these birds are worth a lot of money.
that's motive for the poisoning right there.
national racing pigeon union.
06 for the year the bird was born and registered.
Rs-644 is the owner.
all right, I'll reach out to the national pigeon...
whatever it is, and see if I can't figure out who owns these birds.
Yeah, maybe that'll lead us to the owner of the bloody handprint.
vic's name is Edward Archerson.
he's the birthday girl's father.
and...that's Autumn.
she turned 16 today.
next to her is Debra, the mother.
and then over there is Chaz, the son, channeling the late great Johnny Cash.
the presentation of the car was supposed to be the big finale.
daddy!
dad?
dad!
did anybody notice that the father was missing before then?
party like this, I don't think anybody noticed anything.
excuse me.
C-l-k-350.
bet you the kid doesn't have a driver's license yet.
well, nothing says happy birthday like a $60, 000 car.
you know, when I turned 16, I got my mom's used pinto.
I loved that car.
this isn't about sweet 16.
this is about outdoing the joneses.
help me move him back.
all right.
Hey, Lindsay!
she just got bit by a snake.
somewhere over there.
got it!
don't shoot!
don't shoot! It's mine!
let me see, let me see, let me see.
you're gonna be all right.
I need a med-evac at 633 Cliffside drive.
put this around your arm.
okay, all right, all right, just send ems.
they can't get a med-evac in here.
but ems is on their way, and they're gonna take you to heliport, and the chopper's gonna take you to the snake bite center, all right?
look at me, look at me.
you're gonna be fine. Okay?
you're gonna be fine.
Yeah, yeah.
okay.
Oh, yeah.
that's the same band that's on every one of Mr. Seely's birds.
his coop's just up there.
he isn't in his apartment, he's usually on the roof.
how's Lindsay doing?
she was treated with antivenin bolus.
she'll be fine.
you know Mr. Seely well?
well enough.
you know, just the other day, Ray was telling me how he got one of the networks to pony up a $50, 000 quarter-mile race between one of his pigeons and a greyhound.
do you believe that?
full rigor.
and you're just gonna ignore the bird?
same tag.
this is home.
he doesn't have blood on him like the others, though.
or dead like the others.
this looks pretty.
arterial spray-- he was cut here and...
stumbled back into the coop.
that could explain the bloody handprint we found on one of the birds.
severed carotid-- that's gonna be our COD.
M. E.'S office is on the way.
Howie, did Mr. Seely ever mention any trouble he was having?
nothing specific.
but as I understand, the sport was very competitive.
everybody wants to come after the king.
that's what Ray used to say.
maybe that's why he was thinking about getting out.
what do you mean, he was quitting?
he told me he was thinking about selling off his flock.
who else has access to the roof?
no one.
Mr. Seely paid extra to have the roof to himself.
I mean, it was just him and the kid.
who?
what kid?
uh, he cleaned the coop, fed the birds.
he loved the flock as much as Ray, I guess.
I heard them get into it the other day.
but I wasn't close enough to hear what they were saying.
what's the kid's name?
this cut in Seely's bone looks like it was produced by a toothed blade.
discoloration suggests it was moving at a high rate of speed.
you're thinking the murder weapon was a power saw?
that would explain the high-velocity spatter.
results came back from the reflective substance we scooped off the pigeon coop.
calcium carbonate and conchiolin, it's called nacre...
but more commonly mother-of-pearl.
clam shells in a pigeon coop?
not specifically.
could be the iridescent lining of any number of mollusk shells.
you guys ready for this?
ray Reeley is actually Rudy Santangelo.
I ran background on him-- Ray's prints came back to this guy Rudy who picked up for a couple b & e's when he was 15.
did some more checking-- turns out Rudy-boy testified in a federal case back in '93.
after that, nothing...
disappeared like he never even existed.
our victim was in witness protection.
thanks for meeting me, Candace.
here's your guy-- Rudy Santangelo-- aka, Ray Seeley.
went into protection in New Mexico in '93 when he was 17.
guess he got tired of it, because he came out on his own in '04.
been out of our radar ever since.
tell me what you can tell me.
you know the rules, Mac.
look, I'm not asking the bureau to compromise itself.
just tell me what's pertinent to my investigation.
if I knew why the vic was being protected I might have an idea of who'd want to see him dead.
Santangelo-- Seeley befriended a k-9 cop, Kevin Bart.
community policing and all that.
they grew close.
ray saw Bart and his dog killed by two bank robbers.
the robbers were IRA.
Santangelo testified against them in open court.
ira used to drop four or five bodies a year here in new york.
you think they'd hold a grudge?
we'll let you know.
mac, why do I get the feeling we're going to be bumping into each other on this?
because your witness was found dead and it's my job to find out who killed him.
this car is pristine except for these distinctive scratches here in the hood.
okay, set the light to the lower angle.
I have a date with an unconscious snake.
Limonene...
primarily used in cleaning applications.
possible sources are paint stripper, wax remover...
guitar strings.
guitar strings?
Hey, Stella. Hawkes.
I know how the snake got in the car.
it was an accident.
all I meant to do is scare Autumn.
I didn't mean to hurt anyone.
Chaz, that little prank you pulled put one of my people in the hospital and it put your father in the morgue.
I'm sorry...
I'm so sorry...
the snake charmer we hired assured us it would be safe.
he came highly recommended by my spiritual advisor.
Chaz, did you know your father was going to be in the car?
no.
I didn't mean to kill my dad.
what's going to happen?
is he going to go to jail?
at the very least he'll be charged with reckless endangerment.
now, if your husband did die from the snakebite, he's looking at manslaughter.
mom...
while the unfortunate Mr. Archerson did have a close encounter of the reptile kind...
that was not what killed him.
see this damage to the throat?
here.
crushed thyroid cartilage...
cod is asphyxiation due to strangulation.
if the killer used a soft object, combined with a wide distribution of force, then you wouldn't have any noticeable damage to the epidermis, but you'd still get the damage to the underlying tissue.
what kind of murder weapon does that?
you might want to keep that coat on, boss.
I found traces of termite killer inside the feed box on Seeley's roof.
located the one place that stocks the "fly high" feed and I checked their packages.
all the other bags were clean.
so someone tampered with the feed after it left the store.
the owner confirmed that Seeley had an account there.
sent a kid named Jesse to pick up the feed every week.
Jesse Quinn-- loved the birds as much as Ray.
tracked him down to a pool table repair shop on ocean avenue in Brooklyn.
pool tables...
which have mother of pearl inlays.
call Flack, tell him to meet me there.
Hey, Hawkes...
heard the autopsy report came back on Edward Archerson.
strangulation, murder weapon...
unknown.
blood alcohol level was negative.
that's odd.
the whiskey bottle we found in his pocket was open and empty.
I'll show you something else that's odd.
it's this stray hair I pulled from the vic.
the proximal end of the hair?
Yeah.
if that hair was ripped out during a struggle, that end should be torn not cut.
now see, there's a small segment of the hair that's crushed.
which can happen in cases of blunt-force trauma.
but there was no blood in the car, nothing else to substantiate that, so...
I ran some additional tests.
not even a trace of keratin, propylparaben or fragrance.
that's not possible.
it is if it's virgin hair.
hair that hasn't been treated with a kind of product.
so you're thinking...
that this hair, was ripped out of a very expensive hair extension.
so we've got two unanswered questions-- the hair and the whiskey.
I say we hit the bottle first.
ray Seeley dead?
for real?
afraid so.
decent guy.
my stepson Jesse-- he worked with Mr. Seeley and his birds.
he did that ever since his mom died.
got any leads?
Yeah, working on a couple things.
how'd you get interested in pigeons, Jesse?
Jess, come over.
the man asked a question.
I don't...
I don't know.
stard when I was a little kid.
a pigeon flew into my bedroom-- right through the window.
and she wasn't scared at all.
Hey, Jesse, when was the last time you saw Ray Seeley?
the other day.
the building super said you two had a fight on the roof, Jesse.
were you pissed 'cause he was selling off his flock.
no.
I mean, that's not true.
Jesse, did you damage Mr. Seeley's coop?
there was a cut in one of the wooden posts.
okay, all right, we're done here.
Jesse, would you mind if we had a little talk alone?
I'll cut him off on the other side.
I just want to talk to you, Jesse.
Jesus, who did that to you?
what the hell was that?
you had him. You let him go?
the kid doesn't have a summer house in the Hamptons.
trust me, he'll be around.
trust you?
what's that supposed to mean?
you got a problem with me, just say it.
let's just get out of here.
cops are talking about you, I know that.
they're saying you didn't have dean Truby's back when you gave me the memo book that convicted him.
doesn't matter.
he's in jail. That's what you wanted, right?
I wanted to put a killer behind bars, and I did that.
Truby was a bad cop.
he stole cocaine from a crime scene and he killed somebody.
don, you know you did the right thing.
you want to be angry at somebody, make it Truby.
cause he's the one that forced you to make that decision.
dried blood.
mac, I hope you're right about this kid.
because if the blood on that case matches our vic, your instincts just let our murderer go.
>8 all right, so this eliminates our vic as the source of the print.
now, Edward Archerson didn't drink, so someone had to put the bottle into his pocket at the party.
let's see who may have had a fondness for whiskey.
the Archersons didn't invite any criminals to their party.
the guest list was 90% kids and unless they're robbing banks between classes, they're not gonna be in the system.
depends on the system.
come here.
Brighton country day.
autumn and Chaz Archerson's school.
let me reference their data base.
they fingerprint kids at school?
it's a new little gizmo they use in high school cafeterias.
see, junior just runs his finger over a scanner and...
debits an account.
and we have a winner.
perfection.
I've known Autumn since pre-K.
even then she treated me like I don't exist.
she invited you to her party.
not because she likes me.
hi...
Hi, guys.
Tim. Come up here.
Thanks, Autumn.
never, ever touch me.
autumn said I can make it up to her, if I brought her cousin, Mia Pleskow, to the party, emphasis on the "cow."
so you, uh, agreed to do that?
Yeah.
it was supposed to be the party of the decade.
I just wanted to be included.
or maybe you just thought it would be the perfect place to seek your revenge.
tell me what happened between you and Mr. Archerson.
it was no big deal.
I tried to spike the punch, but that's it.
Hey!
what the hell you doing?
gimme that.
come on.
security!
get this guy the hell out of here.
don't let him back in.
figured Autumn and her friends would get drunk and the princess's sweet 16 would turn into a sweet puke fest.
I just wanted to knock 'em down a peg.
are you telling me it doesn't bother you at all that one of your friend's father was murdered?
do you think it bothers anybody?
you're one screwed up little kid.
Hey.
heard you had a suspect.
Yeah, a 16-year-old.
I'm looking for a teenage suspect, too.
they keep getting younger and younger.
the only problem is, who do you blame-- them or their parents?
Hey, have you heard from Reed Garrett?
no.
nothing yet, but that day in the diner when I described his mother to him, he lit up.
his eyes were just filled with curiosity.
he reminded me so much of her.
I think he'll...
he'll call me when he's ready.
I just want it to be his decision.
you might need to give him a little nudge.
Yeah, well, you know what he's going through.
he's a kid and he needs his space right now.
I can't imagine.
he spends all his time looking for his biological mother and then he finds out that Claire no longer exists.
Oh, she exists, mac.
in your memory and in your heart.
you can show him who she was.
same "w" shape, curve mark and tooth pattern.
looks like you found our murder weapon.
not only our murder weapon.
it also tells us how the coop was damaged.
you said Jesse Quinn had a job building pool tables.
means he had access to power tools.
we got his prints at the crime scene.
and we got motive.
still don't think this kid did it?
Jesse Quinn is not a killer.
and you're right. Let's follow procedure.
call the D. A.
get a search warrant.
let's see if one of Quinn's power saws is our murder weapon.
Hey, Hawkes, what have you got?
these are all the photos I took of the car that we brought back from the crime scene.
now, they were all taken using various lighting angles.
and when I stack them on top of each other...
what is that?
a drachma.
the Greek coin.
actually, in this case, it's part of a coin belt.
and that's what caused the scratches on the hood of the car.
belly dancers wear those.
exactly.
which ties into the party theme-- Arabian nights.
and I remembered seeing a photo station in the room.
so I contacted the photographer...
and I got his flash card.
I isolated all the females who were dressed as belly dancers.
and found the drachma belt.
great work.
Yeah, that's my belt.
I still can't believe someone would kill Edward.
that's an informal way to refer to your best fend's father.
but it was more than that, wasn't it, Paige?
he liked me.
it was flattering.
he bought me things.
and we have a little evidence that suggests how you might have thanked him.
I was just trying to get into the party.
Hi, baby.
what are you doing here?
if Autumn sees you, she's going to throw a fit.
come on.
you weren't invited?
autumn was upset with me.
dad.
honey.
want a sandwich?
did Autumn tell her mother?
you saw the car, right?
that's what it cost Edward for her not to tell.
mac, I got a D. A.
who's asking me a lot of questions.
okay? He wants to know where we are on the Seeley investigation.
I was a little tongue-tied, so I'm asking you.
the blood we found on the birdcage outside the billiard shop turned out to be pigeon blood.
okay, what about the warrant to search Quinn's power saws?
look, I understand the kid looks good, but I'm not gonna rush this.
Patrick Quinn has a history of abuse flag.
Jesse wasn't running from us, he was running from his stepfather.
incident reports filed by er doctors?
Jesse Quinn broke his collar bone on September fifth of last year.
in November, a broken finger.
in March, two broken ribs.
this summer, a shoulder sprain.
four instances this year.
maybe the kid plays football.
in January?
that's when he broke his arm for the second time.
I got our vic's blood on one of the saws I took from Quinn's workshop.
two sets of prints.
Jesse and his stepfather, Patrick.
they share tools.
okay.
you're going to find two sets of prints.
but hear me out, the stepfather's got no motive.
it's the kid.
Seeley was going to sell his flock, Jesse got pissed.
we got our murderer.
just give me an hour.
I'm working on something here.
if I can't prove to you that Jesse didn't do it, I'll make the arrest myself.
I been looking at all the pictures from the party, trying to find a match to the hair that you found in the car.
and I think I found one.
well, the hair's definitely a visual match in color.
Yeah, not only that, if I measure from the top of the head to the hair's terminus...
we have a match.
and Debra Archerson was wearing hair extensions.
that could be her real hair.
not unless she can grow 18 inches in two weeks.
same photographer took their holiday photo.
18 inches.
now, Mr. Archerson's neck size couldn't have been more than 15 and a half.
that hair extension would definitely be long enough to fit around his neck.
and soft enough to not do any visible damage to the epidermis.
we have our murder weapon and we have our murderer.
nice to have you back, Lindsay.
now let's get these over to Stella.
you killed your husband.
what?
first you accuse my son and now me?
we have evidence that puts you in the car.
of course you do.
my husband wanted me to look at the car for the big presentation.
is that when you killed him?
no.
how can you sit there and suggest that I'm a suspect.
Mrs. Archerson, we pulled a hair off your husband's lifeless body and it's a match to this photograph.
your hair extension is the murder weapon.
when Edward was killed I was with my daughter.
Ugh, all day long it was one thing after another.
and then the car.
you're angry about the car?
it was a bit excessive.
edward and I agreed on a Mustang for Autumn.
and here's this ridiculous Benz.
it's what Autumn wanted.
and he always gave her what she wanted.
always? - Always!
well, they can't have everything they want!
they can't.
why not?
it's not like you don't have the money.
I am not like them.
I'm not like them.
I'm not.
I'm so sick of it all.
I just wanted to walk out and leave everything behind-- the party, my daughter...
God.
what kind of a name is that?
autumn was Edward's idea.
he had me sit inside that car...
to see how comfy it was.
you indulge her every whim.
don't be such a downer, Deb.
come on, you only turn 16 once, right?
just try to be happy for once in your life.
it was just too much!
way too much.
if you think about it, in the long run...
it was the right thing to do.
you're worried about the kids.
don't worry about the kids.
cause maybe...
they won't take the little things for granted.
I think they both will be better off.
don't you?
mac, it's Candace.
I need to talk to you; I may have something on the Ray Seeley case.
a lead on a suspect?
well, I won't know until I see you.
can we meet for coffee tomorrow?
Westway diner, 8: 00 A. M.
see you there.
okay.
Hey, I got your page-- what's up?
I think I can prove Jesse Quinn didn't murder Ray Seeley.
here's what I've been working on; take a look.
based on statements and autopsy findings, our vic's official time of death was Friday at approximately 3: 00 P. M.
and we know from the digital clock we found on the coop our bird landed here, Seeley's rooftop, at 3: 18 P. M.
the chip attached to the pigeon recorded a distance covered of 12 miles.
assuming a straight line of flight, the bird was released anywhere along this 12-mile radius.
and that zone includes the billiard shop where Jesse worked.
I believe that's where he was taking care of our little feathered friend.
and it's the same place where we found the bird cage with Jesse's prints and traces of bird blood.
so you're saying that Jesse released the bird from this location.
18 minutes is not enough time for him to murder Ray Seeley, get back to the billiard shop to release the pigeon, and for the bird to then fly twelve miles back to the coop.
good theory.
it just depends how fast the bird can fly.
we need to clock this bird.
you guys in position?
Yeah, we're ready.
all right.
Houston, we have liftoff.
from that direction.
I got him.
twelve minutes, fifty seconds.
just under 60 miles per hour.
that would only leave Jesse about five minutes to get from the murder scene back to the billiard shop 12 miles away.
there's no way he killed Ray Seeley.
which means the second set of prints we got off our murder weapon belong to our killer.
let's go talk to Jesse's stepfather.
What'd you do, Quinn?
hang out in tribeca till Seeley left the apartment?
figured with all the construction going on in the neighborhood, who'd notice another guy with a tool belt and a reciprocating saw?
right?
you went upstairs...
dumped bug poison on the feed...
then you started to take apart the coop.
that's when Seeley returned.
what the hell?
when we came to your shop to break the news, Jesse ran-- not from us, but from you.
you beat your kid.
you think I did that?
you did do that.
he knew what you did, and what you would do to make sure he kept his mouth shut.
let me tell you something.
life ain't a free ride, okay?!
sit.
you sit down.
wrong answer.
you might want to sit down.
kid spent all his time with that freak and his damn birds.
you think he could help me out?
in a shop?
look, I know, it's easy.
blame me for being a lousy parent.
what about him?
huh?
what about his responsibility to me?
kid didn't even go to school, but he was perfectly content to let me work my fingers to the bone.
well, to hell with him!
and the hell with you.
get him out of my face.
stand up.
I gave that kid my name.
he wasn't even mine.
I should have tossed him to the street years ago.
wait.
right now, I'd give a year's pay for two minutes alone in this room with you.
but since that won't happen, I promise you this.
you're going to place where you won't be able to hurt Jesse again.
thanks for bringing her home.
what were you arguing about with Ray Seeley?
Oh, no big deal.
usually, I use the stairs when I take feed up to the roof.
that day, I used the elevator.
I guess some of it leaked.
neighbors must have complained.
her name's Sadie.
after my mom.
after she was the only one that survived, I knew it must have been a sign.
you want to see her fly?
sure.
Hi.
you, uh, you like cheeseburgers?
P. J.Clark's on third?
got the best burgers in town.
come on, I'm buying.
look, Mr. Taylor...
it's Mac.
uh, well, Mac...
I appreciate the offer, but you don't have to start buying me meals because you feel bad.
look, Reed, I'm not here for me...
or you.
I'm here because despite what you told me when we met, that we're not related, we do have something...
very much in common-- your mother, Claire Conrad Taylor.
I'm here for her.
I know that she would have wanted us to get to know each other.
and I'd like to give that to her.
how about it?
I brought pictures.
you got to go?
I'm sorry.
I'll tell you what.
why don't you hang on to these for me?
Yeah, it's FBI agent Candace Broadbent.
get down here now.
looks like she was ambushed on the way to her car.
straight up execution.
no robbery, no nothing.
whoever did this was a pro.
I was supposed to meet her tomorrow morning.
she said she had info on Ray Seeley.
did we snag the wrong guy, Mac?
no.
our evidence led right to Quinn.
I think Candace started asking questions about Ray Seeley...
opened a can of worms, and found a snake.
the topic on every new yorker's mind?
the monster the press has dubbed the cabbie killer.
a serial murderer who has brought the city to its knees by creating commuter chaos not seen since the last transit strike.
the phones are popping.
let's go to Jason on line six.
mayor better get off his ass and do something pretty soon.
people are angry.
buses are packed, d train's a joke.
my 20-minute commute takes two hours now.
you and eight million others, Jason.
let's go to Wendy on line three.
we got 30, 000 cops in this city, Larry.
why can't they catch one crazy cab driver?
Ah, he's nasty.
his breath smells.
makes prom night in the back of my father's caddy with Bianca Difazio seem like it never happened.
back of your father's caddy?
come on, Roland, time to make the doughnuts.
was either that or my Pontiac Sunbird.
let's go, pal.
he's dead.
I lost him.
Jersey City P.D.
you think it was him, the cabbie killer?
well, if it was, he just upped his game.
the son of a bitch killed a cop.
you catch a license plate on the cab?
no, it didn't have any tags.
what about the car?
make, model, year?
I don't know, maybe Ford.
any dents or distinguishing marks?
he was going too fast, I was running.
come on, give me something-- anything.
look, I know I sound like an idiot.
it was a yellow cab, that's all I got.
I get within 20 feet when he jumps the curb, cuts the corner, and he's gone.
that's motor oil.
must have cracked his oil pan.
can't get far if he loses too much.
I was this close.
I could've seen his face.
don't worry about it.
we have every cop in Manhattan looking for this cab.
what the hell?
Ants-- what are you guys, crazy, eating this stuff?
bright red blood.
consistent with carbon monoxide poisoning.
certainly matches our cabbie killer's M.O.
right down to the carvings on the neck.
they appear to be postmortem.
Flack said he pushed him out of the cab while it was still moving.
that's pretty brazen to kill a cop, but then to dump him out in front of the precinct?
the cabbie killer's mocking us.
or daring us to catch him.
Quinn, I see Jersey City sent its finest.
this is the cabbie killer's handiwork, right?
appears to be.
his first victim was from Hoboken.
now he's killed a Jersey City cop?
I'm working the case with you.
the maniac's killed six people.
let's hope this is the last one.
did you work with him, Quinn?
I'm sorry.
no holster, no gun.
probably wasn't carrying.
the cabbie killer murders have been front page news for weeks.
why would anyone, let alone an unarmed cop, get into a taxi in New York City?
the motor oil Danny swabbed off the sidewalk where the cab jumped the curb...
guess why all the ants were lined up like it was a buffet.
I give up.
it's derived from animal fat.
now, it's called G-Oil, a brand-new, environmentally friendly motor oil.
can't be a lot of cab companies using it.
there's only one.
all right, boys, everything gets checked.
if it makes you look twice, I want to see it.
we got company.
what the hell is this?
we have a warrant to search the premises.
now what?
you guys are here every other week.
uh, there's a killer out there and he happens to drive a cab.
and who you think is paying the price for that, huh?
the whole city's a victim.
cab comes in recently with a broken oil pan?
no?
anyone call for a tow last night, early this morning?
no, nothing like that.
all your cars accounted for?
Yes.
every single one.
well, now, that's odd.
cause a man was murdered and dumped out of a cab that was leaking G-Oil.
care to explain that?
you're the detective.
ain't that your job?
Yes, it is.
and I plan on staying here while every cab is processed and every logbook checked, and if I find out that either of you two are lying to me, you're gonna find out just how well I do my job.
what do we got, Montana?
haven't heard that in a while.
just slipped out, sorry.
it's okay, I kinda miss it
I, uh...I processed officer Chameides' clothing, and I found a light brown smudge on the jacket that looked consistent with blood.
you ran it through CODIS?
got nothing
right now, I'm just trying to narrow it down to a specific species.
species?
it's not human?
the DNA came back as primate.
these look random.
they're certainly not consistent with the markings on the previous five victims.
also, these appear to have been made with a bladed instrument.
the wound tracks on James' neck are deeper and much more clearly defined, and the wounds are absent the trace of sycamore, slate and ash I found in the others.
are we looking at a copycat?
information the cabbie's victims had carvings on the back of their necks was never released to the press.
whoever did this wasn't just guessing.
I noticed some bruising.
he was beaten pretty badly.
the size and shape of the bruises indicate multiple sources.
we're looking for three attackers.
everything I've seen so far says the cabbie killer acted alone.
so he didn't murder Jimmy.
no, but there are three guys out there who want us to think he did.
patrol found the cab 20 minutes ago.
nice.
can you give me your flashlight?
few more hours, somebody would've been living in it.
oil pan's cracked.
Yep, that's the cab.
all right, I'll have it towed back to the lab.
gloves?
five Brothers Cab Company.
what?
we seized every document in that garage -
there was not a cab unaccounted for.
looks like our friends are trying real hard to cover their tracks.
and missing paperwork doesn't put them at the scene.
guys?
this case just got a lot stranger.
our Jersey cop was moonlighting as a cab driver.
so Jimmy Chameides was dumped out of his own cab?
we've been looking at Jimmy Chameides' case the wrong way.
we thought we had a dead cop.
what if what we're really looking at is a dead cab driver?
okay. So our cabbie is beaten up by three guys.
but then, they kill him with carbon monoxide, and carve into his neck.
maybe they gave him a taste of his own medicine.
Jimmy was a cabbie, cabbie's been terrorizing the city, putting hacks out of business.
that's why they dumped him in front of the precinct.
they delivered him to us like a gift.
this is vigilante justice.
still doesn't explain how the killers knew about the carvings on the back of the victims' necks.
or why they thought Jimmy Chameides was our cabbie killer.
can either of you help me explain to the mayor how sensitive information about an active serial killer case ends up on an Internet blog?
what sensitive information?
the existence of carvings on the victims' necks.
are you accusing this lab of leaking information to the press?
I'm simply asking for your help.
the investigation of this leak has landed in my lap.
well, plenty of people right on up to the mayor's office were privy to that detail, Jordan.
did you question them, or was it just easier coming in here and accusing us?
that's not fair, Stella.
I'm looking for answers. I'm not pointing fingers.
the last thing I would do is question the integrity of the two of you.
but this administration's at the breaking point.
if this leak came from this office, I can't help you.
mac, it's Reed.
he couldn't have known.
who's your source, Reed?
who told you about the carvings on the neck?
I don't know his name.
how do you get in touch with him?
he contacts me.
what's he look like?
I can't tell you that.
you can, and you will.
look, when I wanted a story, you stayed true to the code of your office, and now, I'm staying true to mine.
this is not a game.
an innocent man is dead.
what are you talking about?
your blog.
you accused a driver named Jimmy of being the cabbie killer.
I didn't accuse anybody.
I reported the information that I was given.
without confirming it.
Jimmy the cab driver was also known as police officer James Chameides.
he was moonlighting as a cabbie out of Five Brothers Garage.
no, wait a minute. I thought chameides was the work of the cabbie killer.
he was... he was dumped from a cab.
his own cab after he was brutally beaten and murdered by three men.
vigilante justice.
now, where do you think they got the idea that Jimmy was the cabbie killer?
you're not blaming me for this guy's death?
I'm blaming you for putting a target on his back.
how'd it go with Reed?
how do you think it went?
Oh, I think you pushed, and he got mad, and refused to give up his source, and then one of you stormed off.
well, if you told me that before, you could've saved me the trip.
come on, Mac. He's 23 years old.
it's his first real job.
he just wants to succeed, and can't see beyond that.
is he really any different than you and I were at that age?
people are dying.
I don't have time for the understanding approach.
okay, well, Reed found out about those carvings.
we need to find his source.
don't let your pride get in the way.
Hey, Stella.
the primate DNA on officer Chameides' jacket?
I traced it back to a rare species.
it came from a white-throated monkey.
I noticed the sample was diluted, and a lot of the cells had lysed, so it was most likely frozen at some point.
so, it wasn't transferred from a live animal?
I'm thinking it was actually somebody's dinner.
white-throated monkey is a popular bush meat.
it's illegally imported from the jungles of Africa and Asia.
in some cultures, it has spiritual significance.
in others, it's a delicacy.
but there are health risks involved with ingesting the meat.
cdc has seen cases of intestinal parasites, Ebola, monkey pox.
problem is, I don't think this gets us any closer to finding our cop killer.
now who do you think is paying the price for that?
actually, Lindsay, it leads us right to him.
looks like you had a pretty bad case of monkey pox a while back.
common for someone who's eaten illegal, tainted bush meat.
the man you and your friends killed -
he had DNA from a white-throated monkey on his clothes.
see, we call that secondary transfer.
and I'll bet when we get a search warrant for your house, that we'll find bush meat in your freezer.
lots of people eat it.
look, Artie, I'm not in a good mood here.
a cop's dead.
whoever killed him almost ran down me and my partner with a cab from your garage.
the same cab you so smugly swore to me was not missing.
I was mistaken.
no, you were lying.
make a fist.
what is this?
I said, make a fist.
the men who murdered officer Chameides -
they left very distinct bruises on his body.
I'm about to match the size and shape of your knuckles to some of those bruises.
you didn't know he was a cop, did you, Artie?
Chameides always kept to himself.
acted like he didn't belong there.
like he was better than everybody else.
whose idea was it?
Jeff Conte pulled up a blog on his computer.
it said it was a driver named Jimmy at our garage that was the killer.
everything pointed to him.
the cops weren't doing anything.
we were starving for fares.
people have to eat, you know?
we thought we were delivering the cabbie killer.
we did.
it wasn't supposed to happen like this.
we didn't know.
please, you've got to believe me.
please.
I have a judge ready to issue an order of contempt if Reed Garrett doesn't give up his source.
you what?
the source knew things that were never released to the press.
he may know the killer.
no, don't. Don't go to a judge.
why not?
mac, this Garrett kid is the only lead we've got.
we can force him to tell us.
where are you?
I'll be there in ten minutes.
you know him.
it's a long story.
one I'm gonna need to hear.
look, just give me a couple hours.
one hour.
go anywhere you want!
Hey, lady, need a cab?
cab, lady?
reed, where are you?
call me back right away.
can I give you a lift?
no, thanks.
come on, give a guy a break.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
just trying to make a living.
got three hungry little mouths to feed at home.
I think I'll just wait for the bus.
get you home before the next bus even gets here.
chances are, it's gonna be packed, and you're gonna have to wait for one after that.
you're probably right.
let me guess.
upper east side?
impressive.
all right.
why not?
so, how old are your kids?
I don't have any children.
but you said you...
what are you doing?
stop the car!
don't do this!
No!
stop!
he left his keys in the door, his backpack on the stairs.
there's no question this is foul play.
you call his parents?
they haven't talked to him since yesterday.
you think someone's trying to take revenge for the dead cop?
I can't get a signal.
Reed's cell is turned off and there's something wrong with it, because even the phone company can't turn it on.
we can't help him if we can't find him.
Hey, mac.
he's posting on his blog.
for weeks, I've been investigating the cabbie killer murders with a certain morbid fascination.
this is in real time.
I'll create a GUI interface using visual basic.
see if I can track an I.P. Address.
what I never anticipated...
was becoming part of the story.
at this moment, I'm sitting "face to face with the brilliant criminal "who has made the greatest city in the world his victim.
he wants you to understand.
he wants me to give you his message.
Reed's source is the cabbie killer.
now the son of a bitch has him.
why can't you see who I am?
I'm trying.
please, okay. I'm trying so hard, I just...
the newly dead who have coins to pay for the ride must be taken across the river, or they'll wander the banks for a hundred years.
okay, do you want me to...do you want me to write that?
is that what you want me to say?
No!
don't you see? They think I'm insane.
they call me the cabbie killer.
use your words.
let them see me deliver the message...to the doomed.
make them understand.
are you gonna kill me?
only those who have the golden branch can cross the river while still alive and return to this world.
type!
now!
the pall of death is overwhelming as I watch him carve into her once-pristine neck.
I don't even know her name.
this white powdery trace could be something.
may be transfer from anywhere Reed stopped on his way home.
it's on the top of the backpack.
mac said some blew off when he picked it up.
all right, so any other movement would've caused it to plume, so it must've fallen onto the backpack at the time Reed was abducted.
Yes.
what the hell's going on?
I just heard he's got Reed.
and another female victim.
I'll call her Claire.
no one should be written about with anonymity.
but then, she shouldn't be dead.
if Reed's using Claire's name in his blog, he's got to be sending you a message, Mac.
who is Reed to you?
he's Claire's son, Quinn!
she gave him up for adoption before we met.
when he came looking for his biological mother, he found me.
unaware that she had died.
look, I know you're busy, but you got to hear this.
this is Reed's interview with the cabbie killer.
I'm not sure I should tell you.
I got a family.
if he finds out...
if you tell me what you know, then we can stop him.
okay, they'll take him away.
he can never touch you.
sounds like they're in his cab.
he'll know it's me.
I can't.
wait a minute, I was supposed to meet someone on that corner and they never showed.
that was you.
that was you.
you want to do the right thing.
you want to tell me.
I can't keep this inside anymore.
he thinks they're doomed, carves in the back of their necks.
what?
what does he carve?
I don't know.
it's his message.
what he wants them to understand.
how do you know all this?
you know him, don't you?
you know him. What's his name?
tell me his name.
that's all I know.
drives for Five Brothers.
and you're sure that's him?
trust me.
he's your guy.
it stops after that.
the interview was a test.
and when James Chameides ended up dead within a matter of hours, the killer realized that Reed's blog was a conduit to the world.
with people everywhere as his captive audience, waiting for the next post, he has the ultimate control.
explains why he took Reed, but...
why would the killer want to turn people against Jimmy?
Where's he blogging from?
somewhere in the city.
that's all you've got?
Reed's typing, but it's not streaming.
he completes a whole post, then he hits enter; it travels in a matter of seconds.
it's happening too fast to get an exact fix on an I.P. Address.
we're running out of time, Lindsay.
here we go.
her eyes are vacant.
there's so much she'll never get to see: The glaciers, a falling comet.
guess I won't either.
he's picking a funny time to get creative with his writing.
I always wanted to go back to Australia where I was born.
I left so young.
reed was born in Australia?
no, he's from Chicago.
so what does this mean?
he's blogging from somewhere in midtown.
best I can do is the west side.
what've you got?
I processed the powder we found on Reed's backpack.
saccharomyces cerevisiae.
yeast?
could be from anywhere: bakery, brewery.
please tell me how we can have all this technology at our disposal, and we can't get a location on Reed.
well, as long as he keeps blogging at least we know he's alive.
it's not enough!
I should never have given him access to the case.
mac, there is nothing you could've done to prevent this.
look, another post.
he likes killing passively.
Claire's the passive one now.
to think-- just hours ago, she was having breakfast, like any normal day.
I wonder what she had: corn flaked?
french toast?
corn flaked?
could be a typo.
Stella, scroll back up.
you got it.
what do you see?
Hawkes found yeast trace on Reed's backpack.
it's not corn flaked, it's flaked corn.
glacier and comet are hops.
australia is a type of wheat malt.
and flaked corn is an adjunct.
all ingredients used to brew beer.
we're looking for a brewery.
Quinn, find me a brewery on the west side in midtown.
we're heading in that direction.
mac, I've got a location for you.
Doohan's brewery, west side highway and Evergreen.
it was closed down six months ago by the Health Department.
that's the cab!
stop right there!
NY P.D.
I need you down here now!
Flack, get on your radio.
I want every available unit.
shut down the west side highway if you have to.
central, I need a level three mobilization at west side highway and Evergreen.
in the vicinity of Doohan's brewery.
suspect is on foot.
dispatch aviation.
my hand-- my hand is too small.
all right. Reed?
hang in there, Reed.
don't die on me.
bus is on its way.
don't die on me. Come on.
okay, let's go, let's get him out.
this cab needs to go to the garage immediately.
there's no bed or food here -
nothing that indicates this is where he lays his head.
probably just his "office."
picked a place of opportunity.
unfortunately for him, this place is no longer available.
Where's mac?
is he at the hospital?
what can I do to help you, Jordan?
there's a press conference in five minutes.
I mean, how's the mayor going to stand out there before a panicked public and report that a killer whose body count has reached seven has eluded capture?
I don't know how to answer that.
I guess he'll just have to tell the truth?
I'm not trying to give you a hard time here, Stella.
don't make me the villain. I'm on your side.
I just wish you were on mine.
what's that supposed to mean?
why am I the last to know that Reed is practically Mac's son?
it wasn't my place to share that information.
Look...the mayor plans to assign the FBI's forensic team to the case.
well, until he does, I got a lot of work to do.
Hey, Jordan...
thanks for the heads-up.
sure.
try something else.
we've tried everything else.
maybe it's the presets on the radio.
how about now?
nothing.
what about now?
hold on. I think you've got it.
pull over!
innocent people died right in the back of this cab.
the prints on the knife used to cut Reed are in the system.
did you get a name?
just a match to a set of prints Danny found Jimmy Chameides' cab all right, proves the connection between Chameides and our cabbie killer;
but it doesn't explain why Jimmy got into the cab.
you know what? I don't think he did.
damage to the killer's front fender and the paint transfer are a match to Jimmy's cab.
they got into a car accident.
buddy! Yo!
what are you doing, man?!
so Jimmy Chameides probably wanted to report the damage, but the cabbie killer couldn't risk that.
I mean, police would've been all over his cab.
instead, he uses Reed's blog to set Jimmy up as the cabbie killer.
so we got a dead cop because he was in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Hey, Mac...
Hey, hey...
Hey.
don't try to talk.
how you doing?
you're going to be all right.
I need your help.
I need to know what you remember.
I know you can do this 'cause you led us to him the first time.
you were in the trunk.
he abducted you outside of your apartment in the west village.
and he drove. For how long?
okay, so ten minutes of street driving and 25 on the highway.
you heard gravel under the tires.
he pulled into a building and put the woman in the trunk?
you saw a Fendi billboard through high windows?
how long were you there?
half hour?
wait. Water running for that long?
took a shower; that must be where he lives.
what else? What else did you see, hear, smell?
candy corn?
he was adamant, it was candy corn.
I knew someday there'd be an advantage to living in Jersey.
there's a candy corn factory in Fort Lee.
I get nauseous every time I drive by it.
the brewery is where the killer carved them, but it's likely the place that he stopped is home.
reed said the highway driving totaled 25 minutes.
west village to Fort Lee?
middle of the day-- no way.
he didn't have to go to Jersey to smell it.
prevailing winds are eastward.
washington Heights.
so a Fendi billboard and a gravel road, in or near Washington Heights.
I processed the hose used to divert the carbon monoxide in the cab.
it's made from a durable, woven cotton that's consistent with the kind used in fire hoses.
he could've bought it or got it from a building.
I don't think so.
it showed signs of stretching from repeated use.
how often does a building use their fire hose?
nobody's going to buy or sell an old, worn fire hose.
it's more like something that was left behind.
now, our cabbie killer seems to like buildings that are no longer in use.
here we go.
an abandoned fire house at Pineview and 181st.
drop to your knees!
put your hands behind your head!
I am Charon...
the son of Erebus and Nyx.
yeah?
well, even the gods can't help you now.
don't you see?
I had to.
all human beings that are doomed lose the right to be redeemed.
they must be put to death.
Leviticus, 27: 29.
get up.
he was a ticking time bomb-- alone, delusional.
the faces on the billboards made him angry.
he saw their slogans as false promises and lies.
his victims were sinners who were doomed and in need of redemption.
the only way to be redeemed was to be killed, and then given passage across the river Styx.
he saw himself as Charon, the Greek god, also known as Ferryman.
his duty was to offer that passage.
the city was a hostage to fear, to panic, to turning against one another, all because of one man's rampage.
now that he's locked up forever, New York can begin to heal.
we all can begin to heal.
Taxi!
the bottle's made of ice for the party, but when it hits the markets, it'll be glass.
can I fill you up?
make it a double.
you want to try both flavors?
here you go.
party time.
this is awesome.
check this out.
this is my masterpiece.
Buri vodka.
I'd rather have her.
straight up, or on the rocks?
which one tastes better?
ladies and gentlemen, presenting Buri vodka's ice princess!
she's bleeding!
it's Liam!
Oh, my god.
call an ambulance! Call 911! - Stay with her.
I'll go get help.
party was for the release of a new vodka.
DOA is Tonya Nettles, the face of the promotional campaign.
statements?
looks like she was killed in the basement before she came up on that platform.
access to the basement?
Yeah, there's a stairway.
the manager, a guy called Colin Flynn, said that only employees have access.
well, see what else you can get, and I'll have a look at the vic.
Messer: I'm sorry, Mac.
I got hung up.
no retraction marks.
and the blood in the fabric looks diluted.
weapon was either soaking wet...
or...
she was stabbed with an icicle?
that's cold.
not cold enough.
our evidence is about to turn into a big pool of water.
love Run Cold
the air conditioning's been lowered to 55 degrees.
this dry ice will help stabilize the ambient temperature.
ice is about 25 degrees.
given the surface area of the crime scene, we have about an hour maximum to procure what evidence may still be here.
these icicles could be part of the murder weapon.
well, we don't have much time to find out.
you got the scene?
you good?
Yeah.
first priority's up here.
I got uniforms keeping the crime scene secure downstairs till you get there.
keep me posted. - All right.
and work fast.
the manager said everyone who handled the ice bottles was told to wear gloves.
everyone but our killer.
the dirty underbelly of show business.
it can't all be glitz and glamour.
Tonya Nettles would not disagree with that.
it's been a long time since I've been stood up on a date.
more wine, sir?
sorry, Danny.
something came up.
phone's not working, or...
I'm really sorry.
are we all right?
Yeah.
sure.
these are the ice versions of the commercial product.
they were filled with vodka for the party.
all right, so this lift is operated from upstairs.
think those are from someone at the party?
well, they weren't our vic's.
she wasn't wearing feathers this color.
from her killer?
well, if they are, looks like he flew the coop.
you're Tonya's boyfriend?
I was visiting my parents up in Beaver Kill, and I got stuck on the Tapanzee bridge coming back.
I thought she'd be so mad if I was late, so I changed in the car on the way here.
miss, you were asked to stay inside till the detective talked to you.
I needed a cigarette.
I've been here all night. It's nearly 5: 00 A. M.
when was the last you saw Tonya Nettles?
not until her grand entrance.
she was in the basement primping. I was up here working.
is there anyone that can vouch for that?
the manager.
won't let you go pee without asking him first.
take a minute.
I'll be right back.
get anything?
negative.
the bouncer said nobody left the bar after Tonya was discovered.
so our witness list might be our suspect list.
runners, take your marks.
three!
two!
one!
runners, proceed with caution.
please follow the cones.
the course has been diverted.
please follow the cones.
proceed with caution.
the course has been diverted.
please follow the cones.
looks like he was pushed, hit his head on the curb.
with all the crap on the ground, he could have easily lost his footing.
lost more than his footing.
what makes somebody want to run 26. 2 miles anyway?
read the sign.
of?
cyanide poisoning.
in the middle of a marathon?
how?
the aid station.
Hey!
no more water!
shut this station down!
the water's bad!
let's get it out of here!
pour it out!
pour it out!
dump it!
be thorough.
every cup. Anything you can find.
the volunteers wear gloves, so even if one of them did poison our vic, we wouldn't get any prints.
could still get poison trace.
true.
it's a high pressure valve.
an odd thing to find at a marathon.
senior vice president, Latchford financial partnerships.
a player.
cause of death was definitely not natural.
he was in superb shape.
lungs, heart, all the vital organs, near perfect.
so you're saying he's actually still alive?
tox came back negative for cyanide poisoning.
there's also this.
looks like frostbite.
Yeah.
related to cod?
well, he didn't freeze to death, if that's what you mean.
it's 90 degrees out there.
bright red blood color, facial lividity.
rapid system failure.
Cyanide's not the only substance that would cause these symptoms.
right.
so, what else could it be?
well, possibly a hemoglobin inhibitor, like carbon monoxide.
co molecules absorbed by red blood cells destroy the blood's ability to carry oxygen, leading to tissue death and organ failure.
same symptoms as cyanide.
just my opinion, but cyanide seems a lot simpler way to kill someone.
murder's never simple, doctor.
now I've seen your crimes I know they're not for me all this time together makes it easy to see...
you ready?
warming up as we speak.
looks like some sort of egg, but the elisa will tell us for sure.
enzyme-linked immuno sorbent assay.
you're soaking in it.
fish eggs.
what are fish eggs doing on a marathon runner's shirt?
autopsy results?
this is a good one.
a runner who somehow has frostbite on his face in 90-degree heat, who died of carbon monoxide poisoning in the middle of central park.
that's just...not possible.
an interesting case.
Tonya Nettles was stone cold sober.
aren't most people when they're at work, Sid?
I'll ignore the implication of your question, detective.
I only remark on it because the young lady's blood alcohol content was zero percent but her stomach was filled with vodka.
that happens how?
the alcohol entered her body either at the time of death or immediately afterwards.
I'd say the vodka came in via this wound in her stomach.
well, the waitresses were pouring vodka from bottles made of ice.
you know, the promoter said that she was supposed to be holding a big ice scepter when she came up.
which is also filled with vodka.
I also found this trace on her cheek over her make-up -- some kind of grease.
Tonya had a compact.
she would have checked her face last.
did she have any trace on her hands?
nary a one.
if she didn't put it there herself...
we have to find out who did.
the nozzle was modified to allow the largest possible burst of gas.
which would maximize and accelerate the effect.
combined with fatigue at mile 25 of a marathon...
less than a second's worth of the gas would have been enough to kill.
explains the frostbite also.
adiabatic cooling of the gas due to rapid pressure drop.
exacerbated by the nozzle modification.
the gas would have been ice cold.
I think this nozzle is one piece of our murder weapon.
who uses carbon monoxide?
well, there are several practical applications.
calibration of home gas detectors, semiconductor fabrication.
it's also a preservative, right?
Yeah, but that doesn't help us much.
you know what does help us?
is the fact that this was a premeditated attack on a specific target, and there has to be a motive out there somewhere.
Flack and his guys talked to all the volunteers and spectators, right?
he didn't find anyone with a connection to the victim.
all right, we have the how, but not the who or the why.
time to cast our net a little wider.
let's re-examine the crime scene.
all right.
you still with us?
Yeah, yeah, I'm sorry, I just-- I can't get over the fact that this happened and that no one saw anything.
I've been going over these feathers.
they're mostly rooster, ostrich, that sort of thing.
more than likely came from the costumes the waiters were wearing at the party.
you getting anything back off the print from the scepter?
nothing in AFIS, but I did get a source for the smear on Tonya's cheek.
soy oil.
some kind of make-up?
soy oil's significant property is its ability to withstand extreme cold.
from the hydraulic lift at the club.
but the way that platform was set up, Tonya couldn't have touched the grease.
well, transferred to Tonya by somebody she worked with maybe?
no codis hit on the blood from the safety pin, and the dna sample from the gum was too corrupted to say anything more than that it came from a woman...
but we do know it's not from Tonya Nettles.
I'm pulling a list of employees.
there's our boy, Flack, the manager from the club.
all right, let's go.
Colin Flynn?
that's me.
NYPD.
we got a couple of questions for you, all right?
do I have to answer?
I'm a cop, not a lawyer, but yeah, you do.
what's that under your eye, Mr. Flynn?
my cat scratched me.
Yeah, I got to tell you -- I don't know what you think, detective -- but you don't really look like a cat person to me.
you sure you didn't hurt yourself at work last night?
maybe playing peek-a-boo with some of the girls at the party?
okay, sure, I was checking out that girl.
I wanted to see if she'd fit in that tiny little costume.
she caught me.
what can I say?
get the hell out of here.
we're gonna need to get your fingerprints.
you're going to charge me with something?
you want us to?
Hey, that's harassment, man.
you know what? You're right.
you're right.
it's my fault.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. You can go. Go ahead.
that was good.
you like that?
Yeah.
got it?
got it.
I've matched Owen Reid's projected finish time with the runners he would have crossed the finish line with.
extrapolate backward and you get the group who would have been in the area where he fell.
according to the race splits, these three runners were with Reid at the 10k, half- marathon, and 20k marks.
interestingly enough, this one here-- Michael Gibson-- was involved in a lawsuit against Reid.
something about a bad $40 million investment.
seems like Owen Reid gave this Michael Gibson a serious run for his money.
and a motive of murder.
Mr. Gibson, we're looking into the death of a colleague of yours in the marathon yesterday.
Yeah, I heard it, uh, it might have been a heart attack.
you don't seem upset.
well, everyone knows the risks of running a marathon.
hmm, last man standing sort of thing?
something like.
you wouldn't have happened to help him fall, perhaps?
county.
I wouldn't need to cheat to beat Owen Reid, no.
we found traces of vaseline on Mr. Reid's back, a handprint with streaks of blood in it.
is that going to be your blood?
I don't know. Should it be?
we have photos of the finish line.
you had blood on your shirt when you crossed.
when you run, various parts of your body chafe enough to bleed.
so we use vaseline.
it helps a lot.
Owen was fading, so I gave him a slap on the back as I took off.
just a friendly slap?
no, there was nothing friendly about it.
I was going to beat his ass.
he's dead, Mr. Gibson.
his lawsuit isn't.
being dead, it's not going to stop him.
it might slow him down a little, but that's about it.
why don't you just quit while you're ahead?
you got enough blood on your hands already.
we'll need a DNA sample.
Yeah.
I thought you might.
why don't we get his prints as well?
seeing as Mr. Gibson here is in such a giving mood.
Yeah.
Colin's prints came back negative.
so is he off the hook?
blood still puts him at the scene.
so what else do we got?
do you want to go get some lunch?
Danny, Mac wants us to wrap this up.
sure, but he doesn't want us to starve to death.
what else did Adam say?
what do you mean?
I mean, that's who you were talking to, right?
Yeah, but what makes you think he said anything else?
I just want to go get something to eat.
all right.
the gum you found?
he matched it to the dental impressions from the vic.
nothing.
the DNA and teeth impressions both negative?
negative.
I'm gonna go back and look at the gum.
no, no, no, no, Adam, Adam looked at the gum.
I just want to grab a slice.
I'm starving here.
where am I?
we need to connect someone to this nozzle.
somebody had to see something.
Owen Reid was lying almost directly on top of this sign.
but it was found 50 yards down the road from the nozzle.
it couldn't belong to the killer.
maybe it could lead us to a witness.
now...
none of these footprints have enough individualizing characteristics to be unique.
but...
take a look at this.
a bicycle, maybe?
or a stroller.
some people like to run with their kids.
but this tread pattern is too narrow to be a stroller.
it's a wheelchair.
still have those results?
Yeah.
okay.
according to this, Owen was on track to finish the race in three hours and 20 minutes.
only one wheelchair finished in that time.
looks like I found my witness.
I checked your stats, you ranked in your age group.
you've only been racing for five years.
that's how long I've been at a chair.
I wasn't born like this.
guy jumped a median on the belt parkway and pow, didn't even see it coming.
he walked away from it, and I haven't walked since.
you said on the phone you had some questions about Owen Reid.
you knew him?
I read the papers.
did you see anything?
I saw him go down.
I just thought maybe he slipped, on those paper cups.
what happened to your hands?
just before that guy fell I crashed as well.
someone got in my way and I went down hard.
that's the repair I'm doing.
so you didn't see anything at all?
one of the disadvantages of being in a wheelchair, you don't see things the way you used to.
they look different.
well, thank you, Mr. Keith.
if I have any further questions, I'll be in touch.
the fish eggs are from Masago.
smelts.
widely used as a garnish for sushi.
popular and cheap.
so no immediate source that links to our suspect.
well, not unless Owen Reid stopped at Norimaku while he was running up First Avenue.
hey guys, you can come here for a second?
I talked to Richard Keith.
not a lot of help, so I decided take another look at that nozzle.
you already checked for prints.
well, given the blank we're drawing with Mr. Gibson, I figured it was good for another go-round.
all right, remember these indentations?
what am I looking at?
I think they're animal bite marks.
and that which bites leaves saliva.
exactly.
and the mystery animal is?
Felis Lybica Sarda.
a Sicilian wild cat.
it's illegal to own because of its protected status.
but as in all things illegal - there are people that just have to have one.
Yeah, several people have been fined in the last 12 months for having one in their possession.
our only link to a suspect is a cat's DNA?
a cat that's owned by a person.
and you have a list of people.
as a matter of fact...I do.
my landlord and me, we had an agreement.
it's still illegal to keep those animals in the city.
I had Psycho for six years.
ever since I came from Sacramento.
all of a sudden there's this law.
I didn't even know.
where is Psycho now?
not in the tree, he died four days ago.
I buried him down there.
what happened?
ate rat poison.
someone in the building had a thing against against cats-- you, uh, you know how many sickos there are in this town?
your vet told you it was rat poison?
he said it was cyanide.
Heather, I'm sorry, but we're going to have to examine Psycho.
you want to dig him up?
I'm sorry.
is there any dignity left?
what do you got?
the gum we found at the crime scene was bubble gum but it had traces of spearmint and nicotine.
one of the waitresses was smoking before I talked to her and then she did a pop of that breath freshener.
she said she wasn't in the basement, though.
well her breath tells a different story.
so you told the detective that you didn't go down into the basement.
that's right.
I was up here working the party.
and did you go onto the stage after Tonya came up?
no.
look, I'm kind of in a hurry.
I have proof you were on the platform where Tonya was killed.
I wasn't there, I told you.
your gum, Jennifer.
you left it behind.
okay.
look, I only went down there to sit on the throne.
feel what it was like to be in the winner's seat for a change.
and did Tonya see you?
she came out of her little dressing room.
caught me sitting there.
you have to earn that seat.
I earned it.
Sure...on your back.
what did you say?
you heard me.
you little bitch!
then I went back upstairs.
is this your costume?
Yeah.
did you go into Tonya's dressing room?
no.
Maybe...I don't know.
I'm going to need your prints.
I was wearing gloves.
how's that going to prove anything?
you were there, so I need your prints.
look, I told you what happened.
my dad's an attorney.
you want my prints, you talk to him.
believe me, I will.
you got a C. O.D. On Psycho yet?
two guesses.
no...
one.
carbon monoxide?
somebody told you.
so why the teeth marks on the nozzle?
did the cat bite the canister used to kill Owen Reid?
or maybe the cat was gassed as a test.
can't rule it out, I guess.
anything else?
Yeah, I found this under one of the cat's claws.
material?
some kind of nylon.
let me take a look at this.
I know where this came from.
I'm sorry, you caught me at work.
you were contacted by a detective earlier today.
about the marathon.
I volunteer every year.
you mind if I sit?
that's the repair I'm doing.
that's a nasty bruise.
Yeah, it's one of the perils of volunteering.
35, 000 runners coming by -- it's hard to avoid them all.
a runner did that?
a runner fell near the aid station. You were working at.
I heard that.
I didn't see it happen, but as you said I was nearby.
it's unforgivable when an athlete's injured.
your upstairs neighbor's cat died.
And?
these tears in your screen make us think that it tried to get into your apartment.
so you think I killed it?
would you mind if I looked around?
well, I'm actually in the middle of a shoot.
but okay.
I mean, please try not to disturb anything.
I see your studio is wheelchair accessible.
that's the law for businesses, no?
I thought you'd approve.
what's this used for?
carbon monoxide-- it brightens the food for the camera.
it's the missing canister.
did you shoot this sushi recently?
day before yesterday.
Why?
you left eggs at central park.
on Owen Reid's body.
I got your message.
you don't like Jennifer for the killing, so I thought I'd take another look at these here.
it just doesn't add up.
Jennifer weighs 110 dripping wet.
there's no way she could have thrust that ice scepter with that much force.
I'm getting her prints anyway.
just tying up loose ends.
so what do you have here?
this one's odd.
the rest of these are common feather but this one comes from a rare jungle bird in central India.
it's called a jungle cock eye.
you know what, at this magnitude the feather should look dull.
see how it's kind of glassy?
Synthetic?
fishermen use these kind of feathers to make flies.
what do you got?
Euglenae.
it's freshwater organisms.
this feather was used recently.
who's our fly fisherman?
I was visiting my parents up at Beaver Kill.
Tonya's boyfriend said he was up in Beaver Kill.
that's up in the Catskills. Freshwater.
trout fishing central.
well, I think we just got a bite.
like I told you earlier, I was never in the basement.
I barely even made it to the party.
Where'd you say you were?
I was upstate -- my parent's place.
that's right, upstate.
you do some fishing up there?
Yeah, sure.
make your own flies?
that was a question.
why don't you just tell us what happened in the basement.
I was never in the basement.
do me a favor now-- don't get yourself in a situation where you're going to tell one lie to explain another lie, all right?
it's just a bad strategy, man.
this got on your clothes when you were changing in your car.
then when you went downstairs that feather fell on the floor.
there were tons of people with feathers on them at that party.
not this particular feather, though.
and when we asked to examine your suit, remember that?
yeah?
we were looking for grease from the hydraulic lift in the basement in the club.
well, guess what?
we found some.
that gives us probable cause to arrest you and take your prints.
which we're thinking are going to match the prints that we found on the murder weapon.
we went out since high school.
we even went to the same college so we could be together.
go on.
almost...almost as soon as we got here, she started talking about needing space, and we should take our time.
said she was waitressing.
till dawn some nights.
she'd come home drunk.
so I followed her to work one day, 'cause I knew, i knew she was lying.
she was dancing.
a dancer.
we had a huge fight.
she couldn't trust me.
I was suffocating her.
the Buri vodka thing came up, she quit dancing.
everything felt better.
we were talking about getting married.
I went upstate to tell my mom and dad, and then, I get this phone call.
I just thought you'd want to know that your girlfriend is sleeping with the vodka man.
I got back in, like, three hours.
went to the club, went downstairs.
we're done, finished.
I'm moving out.
I have to go.
Tonya, please.
I love you.
we've been done for years.
every time we break up, you just stand there with that look on your face.
Yeah, that look.
what are you doing?
I was just so mad.
love run cold.
that'll do it.
Lindsay Monroe, can I talk to you for a second?
Yeah.
I have to know what's going on with you.
look, I mean, you and I -- we have this -- this thing, right?
this chemistry, like we're into each other?
but every time we're in the same room together today, it's like...
don't tell me you don't feel it, also.
I can't do this, Danny.
you can't do what?
I can't...be in relationship with you.
all right, I don't...
I don't...
um, I just...
I'm talking about spending some time together.
dinner, a few drinks.
some laughs.
I like you.
a lot.
but right now, I can't.
it's not you, okay?
it's...
I just...
I need to be by myself so I can work some stuff out that I thought I had put behind me.
I didn't mean for this to happen.
it's okay.
maybe we should just do our jobs.
if there's anything you need from me, just let me know, okay?
your sister's in trouble, Richard.
ms. Cates, we know you killed Owen Reid.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I was handing out water.
you handed out more than water.
you waited till he got to the aid station, and then you poisoned him with this.
I found his skin on this canister from your apartment.
the canister was so cold, he left a piece behind.
I think I know why you did it.
that racer who crashed into you, Richard Keith as luck would have it, he was your brother, who nearly died from an accident caused by Mr. Reid.
you still go by your married name, which is why the connection wasn't obvious.
the DA says unless you confess your involvement, there will be no plea bargain for your sister.
that means life.
richard normally finishes at the top of his age group, but yesterday, he was a full two hours behind.
see, I think he was trailing Reid.
he'd let you know he was coming.
richard had nothing to do with it.
how did he communicate to you that Reid was approaching your aid station?
did he page you from a pay-as-you-go cell phone so we wouldn't be unable to trace it?
the fact that he crashed into me isn't connected to Reid's death.
we know about the settlement Reid negotiated, and how he didn't live up to it.
you took him to court and you still didn't get anything.
I can see how angry that would make you, Sharon.
look, I would be angry, too.
you know when I was hurt, she was more devastated than me.
I figured I could recover, but she never did.
you have no idea.
richard was an All-American runner.
ranked third in the country coming out of high-school.
olympic qualifier in '96. His best marathon time was 2: 26 in Boston.
2:26.
then that animal...
Owen Reid was drunk and he took my brother's life away.
he took his legs away, Sharon, not his life.
whatever agreement you have with Sharon, you owe it to her to accept responsibility.
she made me promise.
she'll tell you everything you need to know.
my brother's already in prison; what he goes through every day.
I killed Owen Reid...in revenge for what he did to my brother.
Richard's innocent.
he had nothing to do with the death of owen reid, and I have nothing else to say.
please don't let go of me.
no...
don't drop me, please...
no...
beautiful!
Hey, you there!
that's right!
Mandi, over the shoulder.
okay, great.
Mandi, love, I need you to turn to camera for me when you hit that ball, okay?
then move the camera, tony.
I'm not a contortionist.
finally, I called about these pillows two hours ago.
could you set those lights up for me over there?
Thanks.
what is this thing made of?
buckwheat hulls, they conform to the head and neck for maximum...
it's lumpy.
well, this is our gelly neck roll pillow.
it's therapeutic moldable gel...
this is it?
this is all you have?
I just flew in from Milan.
is it too much to ask for a decent pillow?
Hello!
I asked you a question.
Mandi, uh, I need to touch up your makeup.
get out of my face, Tess.
I was just trying to help.
Mandi: Thank you for your concern.
I'll call you as soon as I'm ready for a touch up.
and as for you...
call me when she's done. - Okay.
I said,"is it too much to ask for a decent pillow?"
I'm sorry, Ms. Foster.
I'll check the pillow menu.
I'm sure I'll find something that you'll like.
somehow, I'm not in the mood for volleyball anymore.
I'm going to my room.
all right, everybody take five.
don't drop me, please.
Where's Mandi?
please.
right here.
sir, stop that.
please excuse me-- ladies, excuse me.
they were shooting a swimwear ad on the rooftop lounge.
Mandi Foster found the body.
is our victim a model, too?
hotel concierge.
Sara Jackson, 20 years old.
moved here from Minnesota two years ago.
based on the trajectory...
I'd say this wasn't an accident.
open and Shut
I got a partial print off the fingernail.
possible defensive wounds on her arms.
I want this section of the railing to go back to the lab.
have Adam check it out.
what about the victim?
remove the body with the spike intact.
that was a gunshot.
sounds close.
Danny, stay here.
hold the crime scene.
10-13, shots fired next door to the Soho Regency.
send some backup, we're on our way.
I got two down over here.
we got two down.
I need a bus and put a rush on it.
copy that. We'll notify.
is there anyone else here, ma'am?
I'm gonna pick up the gun, okay?
he was hitting my husband in the head with a hammer.
he just kept hitting...
I didn't know what else to do.
I shot him.
are you hurt?
I don't think so.
I'm detective Bonasera.
that's my...
my husband, Dan.
cancel the rush on the bus.
we got two doas.
do you know who this man is?
I've never seen him before.
do you have any idea how he got in here?
I was upstairs getting out of the shower and I heard this strange sound.
I saw...
that man hitting my husband with his hammer.
and I didn't know what else to do.
so I...I shot him.
grace, why don't we go outside, okay?
no, I can't leave him.
no. He's lying here on the floor...
no.
we'll take good care of him, ma'am.
let go.
let go.
careful.
I want this case.
I'm a therapist.
I counsel trauma patients and look at me, I can't even think straight.
you've been through something that most people don't experience in a lifetime.
it happened in my own home.
you're supposed to be safe in your own home.
do you own the gun?
my husband.
what about the hammer?
it was ours.
before I got in the shower, Dan said he was going to hang this...
clock that we got online.
do you have any friends in the city?
anywhere you can stay?
my sister.
I'd like to go upstairs and collect a couple of things.
I'm sorry, Grace.
I can't let you go back in there.
it's a crime scene now, okay.
I understand.
you think I'll be arrested for killing that man?
it's not my place to say.
but the P.A doesn't usually prosecute in self defense cases.
there's one you don't see every day.
betcha kind of wish you were still in the M. E.'S office, don't you?
no, I can safely say the thrill is gone.
all right, we have two crime scenes.
we got one in the hotel here, the other in the apartment building next door.
I think it was a full moon last night.
any way the two crimes could be related?
they don't appear to be.
okay, you two hook up with Stella.
Danny's gonna work the hotel with me.
husband sustained blunt force trauma to the head consistent with hammer blows.
I count...
one, two...
three circular skull fractures.
our attacker took two rounds to the back of the skull.
one's a through and through.
there's also something written on his hand.
257 Morton.
10: 00 A. M.
that's this address.
why would he write the time and address if he was coming here to kill them?
that sounds more like an appointment.
an appointment for murder.
the spike penetrated the chest wall and perforated the aortic arch.
a couple of centimeters to the right, she might've pulled through.
when I was an intern, they brought in a guy who'd fallen from a loading dock onto a container of steel reinforcement rods.
talk about a 1, 000 points of light-- now, Sid,
I'm sure that's all fascinating, but I'm kind of jammed up here today.
why...
why'd you leave this on?
Oh, yeah, look at this.
cartier came out with these bracelets in the 70s.
they're supposed to represent enduring love.
only way to remove it is with a special screwdriver which is kept by the giver of the gift.
of course, I could've cut it off, but i couldn't bring myself to damage such a sentimental part of the victim's life.
what about these gouges here?
uh, fingernail marks.
I collected some kind of oily substance from the wound tracts.
her vaginal sample tested positive for seminal fluid and I also found some hairs on her inner thigh.
they're not hers.
so we have her bracelet, fingernail marks, sexual activity and foreign hairs.
add it all up...
could be looking at a lovers' quarrel.
a lovers' quarrel.
what were you up to, Sara Jackson?
Oh, man this oily substance it found, not only do I not know what kind of cell it is,
I don't even think it's human.
I'm having the same problem with the hair.
microscopic characteristics are sometimes hard to nail down.
just keep at it.
camel hair.
camel hair?
what are camel hairs doing on our victim's thigh?
I use that brush in my work.
we found camel hairs on Sara Jackson's body.
and evidence of recent sexual activity.
we'd like a reference sample of your DNA.
what, so you can stick it on some government database?
no way.
I know my rights.
we have rights too.
they're called warrants.
okay, so I partied with her last night.
sex in not a crime.
no, it's not.
however, several witnesses say that you left the roof lounge the same time as the victim.
Yeah, so what'd you do?
wait for her in the atrium?
I came back here to my room.
when these supermodels pitch a fit, it can be three, four hours of down time.
easy.
that's enough time for another round of fun and games with Sara.
Yeah.
so what happened?
you make a play for her she shut you down?
bruise your ego?
let's go back to my room.
no, no, just let go of me.
the only reason I was even with that girl cause I was doing Mandi a favor.
having sex with the hotel concierge was a favor?
look, Mandi introduced us.
she told me Sara was an aspiring model.
and asked if I'd take her head shots.
Mandi and Sara were friends?
I don't know what their deal was.
I just take the pictures.
we're going to need some fingerprints to go along with that DNA.
our hammer man's name is Ron Blunt.
he's already in the system.
for what?
indecent exposure.
he took a bath in the Lincoln center fountain last year.
any history of drugs?
tox screen showed traces of an anti-psychotic called risperidone.
all right, maybe he went off his meds and had a meltdown.
we found out that his name is Ron Blunt.
does that name ring a bell?
he's the limo driver.
he drove my husband home from the airport a few weeks ago.
something happened?
he told Dan that he could speak to spirits and fly above the trees.
he started driving erratically, and refused to stop the car.
Dan, I really think you should report this to the police.
it won't do any good.
they're just going to rubber stamp it.
well, you have to do something.
the behavior that you described me indicates paranoid schizophrenia.
he needs help.
I called the limo company and told them that one of their drivers was potentially dangerous.
and that he needed a psych evaluation.
and did they follow through?
well, I don't know if he ever got treatment, but I'm pretty sure that he...
was dismissed.
I should've listened to Dan.
I should've just left it alone.
this is...
this is all my fault.
no.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I'm such a mess.
um, I was wondering when I could get back into my apartment?
it's kind of hard living out of a tote bag.
well, we're still processing the scene but even if we weren't...
grace, I know you think you're ready to go back in there.
but you need to give yourself some time.
now, I would be happy to send someone back to your home to get a few things if you'd like.
you just let me know.
my home?
when I close my eyes I can still see...
the blood all over the kitchen.
and Dan lying there on the...
floor.
Hey.
prints from the hammer.
some were smeared, but I did get a partial from Ron Blunt and a set from the victim.
Thomason's prints are on the hammer because he owned it.
which means that Ron Blunt came to the scene without a weapon.
so the murder wasn't premeditated.
I'm surprised you're jumping to that conclusion, Lindsay.
just because he didn't bring a weapon doesn't mean he didn't have intent.
well, so far, we don't have anything that says he came to the scene with the intent to kill.
well, we have Blunt's background check.
not only does he have a history of psychiatric problems, he was fired three days before the murder.
that sounds like a revenge killing to me.
well, what about the flowers?
here's his autopsy report.
Peyton found traces of pollen on his hand.
I fumed the wrapping from the flowers and his prints were all over it.
well, maybe he used the flowers to get into the apartment.
I mean, looking through a peep hole and seeing a bouquet of flowers isn't exactly threatening.
true but Dan Thomason knows what he looked like, so he wouldn't of just let him in.
well, he must've.
there were no signs of forced entry-- Blunt didn't break in.
you know, maybe we're looking at this the wrong way, Stella maybe Thomason got scared when he saw Blunt at the door, despite the fact that the flowers are just what they appear to be-- a peace offering, his way of saying he was sorry for the whole limo thing.
okay. He came to apologize, found it unsatisfying and took it to the next level.
Hey, I'm...
I'm just doing what you taught me.
I'm just asking the tough questions.
but you're looking at a schizophrenic and expecting rational answers
the only two people who know exactly what happened in that room are dead, Lindsay.
it's our job to collect the evidence and examine it.
and the sooner we do that, the sooner we can all move on.
we're fine.
I spoke with Grace Thomason.
she's blaming herself.
common reaction.
you know, we go to crime scenes and we start rattling off platitudes to people.
words of pain and loss and healing.
and the truth is, all we really about is the business of death.
I know this has to be a little tough on you, Stella.
Yeah.
actually, I think it's good.
it's bringing out stuff that I haven't dealt with.
Yeah, I look at Grace and...
I know what she's going through.
that's our very first case together.
I remember the look in your eyes at the end of each day, when you processed the crime scene and analyzed her clothes.
I'm going to tell you now what I told you then:
it's hard to separate yourself emotionally, but in the end, always comes down to the evidence.
I didn't forgot that, Mac.
this case is different.
hell, I'm different.
I know what it's like to be trapped in your home.
and I have a vivid memory of that horrible moment when you realize the only way out is a bullet.
I have no choice but to be emotionally involved.
you got anything on the railing?
that's a joke, right?
call it wishful thinking.
it's got more trace on it than a public rest room.
actually, I have no idea what I'm looking for here.
well, sometimes you don't know what you're looking for until you find it-- thank you.
our photographer's prints didn't match the print we found on the victim.
we got a hit on someone else.
see if you can put it on the railing.
Mandi foster, oh.
uh, I love Mandi foster.
you were picked up three years ago for assaulting your assistant with an iPod.
police report said it wasn't the first time.
I tossed her my iPod.
it accidentally hit her in the head.
that's the truth.
I was there.
she sold her story to the tabloids for 50 grand.
bought a tanning salon with it.
you're the stylist, right?
Tess Larson? Yeah?
we don't need to talk to you right now.
could you leave us alone, please?
Tessie, how about some water?
Volvic, room temp.
Thanks, Tess.
we found your fingerprints on Sara Jackson.
I must have touched her when I found the body.
I remember checking for a pulse.
on her fingertip?
what can I say?
I've never seen a dead person before.
I was freaking out.
we have a witness who says that you knew the victim and that you arranged for her to get head shots.
deluca, that idiot.
we'll take that as a yes.
I met Sara here at the hotel.
we talked a little. She said she wanted to be a model.
I tried to help her.
end of story.
and you did all of this out of the goodness of your heart?
Yeah, that's right.
models have hearts, too, you know.
when Blunt attacked Thomason with the hammer, he should've ended up with some medium-velocity blood spatter on his shirt.
I can't find any.
any spatter could've been covered when he fell into the blood pool.
Yeah, well, let's spray it with luminol.
maybe we're just not seeing it.
Hawkes, I need you to take a look at something.
okay.
brain tissue.
from the blood i collected in the bathroom.
it's Dan Thomason's DNA.
so how did Dan Thomason's brain matter end up on the bathtub?
I don't know.
I mean, there was no blood trail leading in that direction, at least none that we could see.
there's also a possible inconsistency with the spatter on Blunt's shirt.
looks like we've got some unanswered questions.
then let's answer them.
so I finally identify that substance we found in Sara's arm wounds.
bovine stem cells.
cow stem cells.
those are used in medical research.
as far as I know, that's all they're used for, but I'll keep looking.
Hey.
so I went down to the deli to get a cinnamon twist, ran into a friend of ours.
paparazzi must've been hiding behind a potted plant.
I don't know.
the angle's pretty low, and look at this bracelet.
it belongs to Sara Jackson.
so she took this photo?
there's just one problem with your theory.
that was the editor of entertainment worldwide.
the photo came from a digital video which was uploaded to their web site two hours after Sara's murder.
get a subpoena for the video.
whoever took it could be our killer.
all right, according to Grace Thomason's statement, Blunt was standing about two feet behind her husband.
just about here.
ready?
Yep
okay, here we go.
medium-velocity blood spatter.
Thomason went down with his head right about there.
his arm was bent and his feet were over there.
all right, you ready, hammer man?
okay, concentrated blood pattern on the chest and the blood pool.
medium-velocity blood spatter on the neck, shoulder, and arms.
there should have been a similar pattern on the shirt that Blunt was wearing.
and the fact that there wasn't suggests that Blunt didn't wield the hammer.
what else do we have?
okay, let's check the gravitational drops.
bring the hammer down.
no match.
lower it again.
still no match.
lower it again.
we have a match in stain size.
one foot, eight inches.
okay, adjusting for arm length.
whoever held the hammer was between 5'2" and 5'5."
Ron Blunt is six feet.
you wanted to see me, Sid?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
uh, glove up.
you're gonna want to check this out.
when Sara Jackson's body went into rigor, something interesting happened.
what?
look.
check her right hand.
it's not in rigor like the rest of her body.
muscle exertion at the time of death caused her hand to go into early rigor.
that would only happen if she was clutching something when she died.
we didn't find anything at the scene.
maybe someone pried her hand open and took it out.
once the rigor was broken, it didn't return.
right.
you're looking for an object that would have fit in the palm of her hand.
Sara was holding a camera when she died, wasn't she?
how should I know?
because you cracked open her hand and took it out.
leaving your fingerprints behind.
whatever.
why do you guys keep harassing me?
we tend to do that when we think someone is guilty of murder.
this doesn't make sense.
why would I kill her?
because you found out she was videotaping you.
you got angry, told her to give you the camera.
when she didn't give you the camera, you had one of your outbursts.
only this time, things got really out of hand.
give me the camera.
no.
give me the camera.
give me the camera, Sara!
No!
let go!
okay, I admit I took the camera, but I'd been through a traumatic experience.
I think you guys are forgetting that I'm the victim here.
Really?
I don't think Sara Jackson's family would see it that way.
I'm really sad about what happened to Sara, but she was already dead when I found her.
What'd you do with the camera?
I got rid of it.
where?
why does it matter?
it's evidence.
well, it's in the Hudson now.
if you threw the camera in the river, how'd the photos end up in entertainment worldwide?
you sent them, didn't you?
it was a business thing.
what kind of business thing?
Sara was supposed to videotape me, leak it to the press, and in return, I was supposed to get my photographer to take head shots of her.
I don't know what went wrong.
so you're telling me this whole thing was a publicity stunt?
look at Kate Moss.
she's gotten over nine international covers since she was videotaped doing coke.
stand up.
what are you doing?
we have enough evidence to charge you on probable cause.
but I told you I didn't do anything.
you were at the scene of a homicide, you took the camera out of the victim's hand.
look at it this way, kitten.
it's free publicity.
son of a bitch.
grace planned this whole thing.
there's Sara.
looks like her camera had some kind of clip-on attachment like a cell phone.
here's the cover shot.
that looks...
that's the Thomasons' apartment in the background.
Where'd you get this?
Sara Jackson took it on the roof yesterday, before she died.
so it looks like Mandi was on the up-and-up about the videotaping.
still doesn't mean she's innocent.
Hey, what time was this video taken?
around 9: 35.
so you'll never guess what bovine stem cells are used for these days.
facials.
Oh, that's a new one.
Yeah, apparently it reverses the aging process.
only a couple places in Manhattan do it.
luy for us, one of them is the Soho Regency spa.
was Mandi foster on their client list?
along with her stylist and her agent and about seven other hotel guests.
well, now all we got to do is narrow it down.
boom.
the blue markers represent your biologicals.
baby spit-up, semen, e coli bacteria, saliva...
not all from the same person, I hope.
according to the DNA results-- ding, ding, ding!
you are correct.
what are the yellow markers?
uh, consumer goods.
juicy fruit gum, eyebrow pencil, pomegranate juice.
that's a great antioxidant.
next, you got your reds.
metals and minerals.
copper, brass, gold, 14-karat, 18-karat.
there was a mix of turquoise and silver.
wait.
turquoise and silver?
uh, yeah.
Tessie, how about some water?
Volvic. Room temp.
I need to see that turquoise and silver trace.
it's right down...
down...
it's right here.
scratches have a forward directionality.
imprint is pretty deep.
minute amount of silver trace actually embedded in the wood.
would take a lot of pressure to do that.
someone...
leaning over the railing...
holding something heavy.
Yeah.
how much did the victim weigh?
uh, 115.
what are you talking about?
you pushed Sara over the balcony in the atrium, and then you tried to save her.
I wasn't anywhere near that atrium.
when you leaned over the railing to grab Sara, your navel ring imprinted on the railing, leaving microscopic amounts of turquoise and silver.
we were able to simulate the conditions and get the same results.
tons of people wear navel rings.
how many of them also had a bovine facial in the hotel spa?
what does that have to do with this?
everything.
we found bovine stem cells in the wounds on Sara Jackson's arms, transferred from your nails.
you were the only hotel guest who had both a bovine facial and VIP access to the rooftop floor.
so you want to tell me what happened?
I've been with Mandi since the beginning.
she gave me my start.
I just wanted to protect her.
from what?
the paparazzi, the tabloids. They're...
waiting for her to screw up.
they're just...
they're like sharks circling, they're everywhere.
Tess, Mandi planned this whole thing.
it was her idea.
what do you mean?
Mandi arranged for Sara to videotape her on the roof for publicity.
it was all for the publicity.
no.
that's not true.
can't be true. I just...
is it too much to ask for a decent pillow?
I asked you a question!
Mandi, I need to touch up your makeup.
get out of my face, Tess.
I said...
hey...
I saw what you were doing.
give me the camera!
No!
give it to me!
No! You don't know what you're doing!
you can't do this!
let go of me!
No!
please...
please don't let go of me!
help me, please...
no, don't drop me!
I just wanted the camera.
I just needed to get the camera from her.
I didn't want to kill her.
the evidence we got from the crime scene reenactment was damning, but inconclusive.
so I had to go back to the only real solid evidence we have.
the brain cells from the blood in the bathroom.
I couldn't figure out how they got in there.
and then it hit me.
grace didn't take a shower before her husband was killed, she took one afterwards.
so you're saying Grace killed her husband, took a shower and then shot Ron Blunt?
mac, Grace planned the whole thing down to the last detail.
and this is proof.
I enhanced the video that Sara Jackson took from the roof.
okay?
see, I think Grace had already bludgeoned her husband at this point.
notice she's wearing a white t-shirt, and her hair is dry.
so she hasn't taken a shower yet.
right.
now she's heading to the bathroom here.
probably to take that shower.
when she took off the bloody t-shirt, a drop of the blood containing her husband's brain matter must've fallen onto the bathtub.
so this is all happening right before we arrived at the hotel for the Jackson murder?
exactly.
see, I checked the police report, and we entered the Thomasons' apartment at exactly 9: 50.
that's 15 minutes after this video was taken.
grace had wet hair and she was wearing a pink shirt, remember?
the question is, where's that white t-shirt?
she could've tossed it.
there's an incinerator shaft in the hall.
no, I don't think she had enough time to go out in the hallway.
see, Ron Blunt had "10: 00 A. M." Written on his hand.
when we got there at ten to 10: 00, he was already dead.
he must've arrived early.
so she had enough time to change her shirt, but not dispose of it.
and there was no opportunity after she shot Blunt because we were on the scene within seconds.
that's why she was so anxious to get back into the apartment.
I'd like to go up to Sara's and collect a couple of things.
I was wondering when I could get back into my apartment.
to dispose of that t-shirt.
framing a man with known mental problems was very clever.
but then again, you're a therapist; you'd know who to pick.
I really have no idea what you're talking about.
Oh, see, now, that's a clich?
I would've expected something far more imaginative from you.
okay, that's just being passive-aggressive.
you had it all planned down to the last detail, didn't you, Grace?
see, the only thing you couldn't have known is that we were seconds away on another case.
you know, I just buried my husband.
why are you doing this to me?
Ron Blunt's funeral is tomorrow.
see, I doubt anybody will be there, because the press has painted him as a depraved murderer.
because that's exactly what he is.
now, that's projecting.
you're the one who brought that poor man to your apartment.
I mean, what did you say to him?
that you would help him get his job back?
well, you tell me.
I'm sure you have a theory.
well, he brought you flowers.
I'm sure he was just trying to make a good impression.
and then, you led him into the kitchen where the body of your bludgeoned husband lay.
and you shot him in the back of the head.
and then you put the hammer in his hand, so his prints would be on it.
I suppose you have evidence to back up this outrageous accusation.
I found your little white t-shirt, shoved in the vent in your bedroom.
that's why you wanted to get back into your apartment.
wanted to get rid of all that stuff.
how am I doing so far?
you didn't have to live with him.
maybe not.
but murder isn't the solution.
isn't that a bit hypocritical?
I mean, coming from you.
excuse me?
Yeah, I read somewhere that you shot your boyfriend three times in the chest, point blank range, in own your apartment.
was last year, wasn't it?
that was self-defense.
I was a victim, and you're a cold-blooded murderer.
Hey.
the old stomping ground.
it's been a while.
thanks for coming, Mac. You want something?
no, no, I'm still on the clock.
you sounded a little rattled on the phone.
everything okay?
I think somebody's following me.
what makes you think that?
I'm hearing footsteps and seeing shadows and glimpses of something or someone and...
look, I know this sounds crazy, but I really feel like I'm being watched.
this is at your place?
no, no, actually it's, uh...
as I go into work, twice on the subway, when I was shopping today.
when did this start?
Uh...about a week ago.
I first felt it, when I dropped off your birthday gift at your place.
well, I'll assign a patrol unit.
we'll have some guys outside your place.
no, no, that's not necessary.
okay.
a homicide on Lafayette.
come on, I'll drop you off at home, it's on the way.
no, no, it's okay.
I want to enjoy every last minute of my day off.
just telling you makes me feel a lot better, okay?
okay, I'll call you.
a little early for the Macy's thanksgiving day parade.
well, according to ms. Lorraine Hannaford, a century-old tradition doesn't just happen.
there's months of prep.
organizers inflate balloons, check for leaks, let their volunteers get a trial run at steering these things.
this big fella was scheduled for a test run tomorrow morning.
how'd our vic get in here?
must be some kind of security in this place.
security guard. Norman Baker.
says he was outside making his exterior rounds, came back, saw the door to the alley open, vic dead.
claims he didn't see or hear anything.
looks like our only witness is full of hot air.
expensive marker, top of the line equipment.
we got a paintball pro here.
we have a name?
no wallet, no id.
gunshot wound to the shoulder.
right at the scapula.
bullet's more than likely deformed-- little chance it'll get us a hit in ibis.
wound to the chest is a through and through
still looking for the bullet.
looks like we'll have to perform an autopsy, on our wounded soldier.
they build these balloons in sections and divide them into compartments.
Yeah, that would explain the limp arm.
and our bullet's somewhere inside all that polyurethane.
thought you might want to do the autopsy.
for old times sake.
this job is never boring.
all right.
the red in the green paint is definitely blood.
but I also found orange paintballs near the body in the warehouse and on the dumpster.
all right, so there was another paintball player in the alley.
maybe their friendly little game turned serious and mr. Green paint traded in his ammo for the real thing.
but then where did he go?
I mean if you just shot someone why would you run in this direction?
there's no way out.
got a dead end.
got a locked gate.
and this door is locked.
what about a car?
seems the only way in and out for a vehicle is blocked.
paint trail starts there leads here and then just stops.
I'm telling you, Stella, this guy got to this spot...
then poof.
he just disappeared.
more blood.
how you doing, sir?
did you hear or see anything strange in the alley last night?
well, that depends on what you consider strange.
I mean, is this New York city, or what?
good morning, miss, were you home last night?
are you with the government?
are you here about the aliens?
uh, I'm with the nypd.
I'm sorry I was...
whoosh, whoosh, whoosh. It was right under my window.
did you see anything?
no, I would never look out my window...
my son said he saw two guys running around with guns.
I thought he was making it up.
can I talk to him? He's with his mother today?
I get him every other day.
I went to bed around 8: 00.
those paintball guys are around here all the time making noise.
okay, thanks.
uh, I'll leave my card.
call if you think of something.
I'll just leave my card
I'll just leave my card.
thank you.
nine millimeter.
it's been a little tough going.
fragment's really beat up.
bullet must have ricocheted before it ended up in the balloon.
using the fragment,
I was able to reconstruct the bullet to get the general rifling characteristics of the gun that fired it.
five lands and grooves with a right hand twist, consistent with three different types of firearms.
I'm hoping the little striae that's there will get us a hit in ibis
anything on the security guard's weapon?
no match to the fragment, he was negative for gunshot residue.
we're no closer to the shooter, Mac.
and this tiny little piece of metal is all we got.
that looks fun.
bullet through the chest is what killed him.
it entered from the back and exited just below the xiphoid process of the sternum.
take a look at the entry wound.
traces of black powder inside the wound.
gunshot residue?
he was shot at close range?
I arrived at the same conclusion. -But?
but there were no powder burns or stippling on the clothing surrounding the wound
I sent a sample of the black trace to lindsay at the lab along with prints for an I. D.
Now...the most interesting part of this whole autopsy is the gunshot wound to the shoulder.
examine the wound cavity.
it appears torn and irregular.
there's a possibility the bullet was tumbling before it hit the victim
I was hoping to confirm that once I retrieved it, but it wasn't there.
what?
the wound cavity was empty.
the torn and irregular tissue is because our shooter...
removed the bullet?
do you know him?
Yeah, that's Kym.
that's Kym Tanaka. He started our team.
are you telling me he's dead?
I'm sorry.
when's the last time you saw him?
uh, last night around 9: 30, we were at this club entry playing pool, you know, drinking beers-- he was the first one to leave.
he said he had someplace to go.
A-actually, he said he had something to prove.
any idea what he meant by that?
Kym had this ongoing war with Cyrus Menlo.
both were at the top of their game in professional paintball.
major competitors.
did they take that attitude off the field?
sometimes, yeah, but yesterday, most definitely.
stay out of my face, you hear me?
let's get out of here, Kym, come on.
any day, Cyrus. Come on.
I'll take you on any day.
this Cyrus Menlo, where can we find him?
well, he had a game here earlier today...
but they said he didn't show.
we're gonna need a full description of this guy
no problem.
that's him.
Cyrus Menlo is M. I.A.
we got half the nypd looking for him.
none of his teammates or his family have seen him since yesterday.
his father is adamant that Cyrus wouldn't have done something like this
he was even willing to give us a piece of his clothing.
now, dna from the epithelials were a match to the blood that Danny found in the green paint in the alley.
I guess mr. Menlo doesn't know how competitive his son is.
the black trace that Sid found in the gunshot wound of Kym Tanaka...
is not gun shot residue.
he got the same negative results from trace I collected off the crate at the scene
so, if it's not G. S.R?
it's black cocaine.
it's produced by mixing pure cocaine with ferric chloride or iron thiocyanate.
those chemicals turn the white cocaine powder to purple or black.
make them undetectable in field drug tests or by drug-sniffing dogs.
they usually hide and ship those drugs in printer toner cartridges.
get out of here.
you got to have a master's degree in chemistry just to run drugs these days.
Lindsay, check our narcotics database.
maybe we can track the origin of the coke, connect it to any previous seizures by its chemical make-up.
see if you can get us a warrant to search those boxes in the warehouse
I'm thinking our vic...
walked into a big money drug buy.
Yeah, that explains what happened to Kym Tanaka, but where's Cyrus Menlo?
Lindsay? -Yeah.
you okay?
I ran the chemical profileof the black cocaine against our internal database.
I got a match.
well, usually that's a good thing.
drugs with the exact same chemical make-up as the trace you found at the warehouse were confiscated in a raid six months ago.
they were held in nypd evidence and then destroyed.
all 50 kilos.
you double-checked this?
mac, I triple-checked it, and it's a highly unique blend of cocaine.
now we're finding traces of t hat same drug in a warehouse.
and I spoke with two dea both of whom witnessed the incineration of the drugs and the mixing agents.
even if somebody had the recipe and the ingredients, there's no way they could have come up with the exact same chemical profile.
means our guys at the raid didn't get the whole stash.
do you have the arrest report?
the lead detective credited with the bust was Flack.
it was a good raid. We got everything.
you're sure.
it was a dingy little apartment there in brooklyn over by the 77th.
we arrested three guys... -thanks, Hank.
we arrested three guys, confiscated 50 kilos of cocaine, all the cutting agents.
inside the apartment, we all split up and searched different areas.
found several glocks the kitchen table, all the expected drug paraphernalia.
did you find the drugs?
I was in the kitchen.
the drugs were hidden in a mattress in the bedroom.
which detective found the drugs?
I can't remember.
and you're sure it was just 50 kilos?
Yeah, we didn't miss anything, Mac.
Why? What's going on?
we found traces of cocaine at the warehouse last night with the same chemical make-up as the cocaine confiscated in your raid.
okay.
50 kilos along with cutting agents were secured as evidence and those same 50 kilos got destroyed.
if the drugs were recovered and then burned, it doesn't add up
if?
did you say "if"?
so you think there was more cocaine at that raid and someone-- one of my guys-- skimmed from the stash?
I'm just asking questions, Don.
no, you're not just asking questions, Mac, I know you.
you wouldn't be here talking to me if you hadn't already tracked the chain of custody, checked with property, and called the dea agents.
and let me tell you something.
cocaine from that raid wouldn't last six months on the street
so what is this? My interrogation?
you're overreacting. -Well, maybe I am, but let me save you a little bit of time.
none of my guys took a thing.
you can't be sure of that;you weren't there.
you just said you didn't remember.
it didn't happen, Mac.
you're listed on the dd-5 as the recorder at the scene.
you had to take everything down in your memo book.
every detective who was there, who searched the room, who found the drugs.
are you asking me for it?
you can check your notes or you can let me do it.
is this official business?
it's a request from a friend.
then I'm gonna have to think about it.
Hey, guys.
Hey, Danny, remember that rust stuff you found in the alley?
rust stuff? -Rust stuff?
can you respect the time it took me to collect that and at least call it trace?
okay, it contained traces of molasses and non-human blood, -bear blood to be exact. -What?
north american grizzly bear.
but, but there's more.
the blood on this rock is a match to Cyrus Menlo, but it's also a match to the blood found on these leaves.
both human blood, right?
right, but you put them together like this.
Shazaam.
you got one leaf with a hole in the middle of it.
a hole probably made from a spike or something with a jagged edge.
huh? Huh? See where I'm going here?
bear blood, molasses, leaves with human blood on them, a spike and a jagged edge. You're talking bear trap.
Yes, you win the washer and dryer.
Whoa-ho-ho, help me out here.
you're telling me that cyrus menlo was caught in a bear trap?
Yeah. -You're crazy.
it's the only conclusion we can arrive at with this evidence.
so Tanaka sets the bear trap, leads Cyrus Menlo down the alley, Tanaka goes into the warehouse.
Tanaka gets shot, Cyrus walks out, steps in the trap while Tanaka bleeds to death inside the warehouse.
moral of the story, all right?
stick with bowling.
what up?
okay, let's say we buy that story.
first of all, why didn't Tanaka just lead him into the trap?
he didn't need to go into the warehouse.
more importantly, if Cyrus Menlo were stuck in a bear trap, how did he get out of the alley?
the rust stuff.
there was directionality.
there were drag marks.
so he could have dragged himself out of there with the old rusty bear trap still on his leg
but we've checked all the hospitals and emergency rooms.
his family hasn't seen or heard from him.
I mean, if he got himself out of the alley, don't you think he'd go for some help?
not if he just whacked somebody.
well, it still begs the question: Where the hell is he?
I say we go back to where we know he was last.
let's look over the evidence from the alley.
thanks for confusing us.
you're welcome.
here's what you asked for. -Oh, thank you.
I see the look of victory.
who we taking down?
that's two doors down from the crime scene.
see these little pieces of paper?
they were crinkled together like an accordion.
they were stripped from the box because of friction underneath.
the box was dragged.
but there would need to be pressure on top.
like Cyrus Menlo's unconscious body?
it was a quick and easy way to get him out of there.
okay, so now you're saying that Cyrus Menlo was unconscious and dragged from the alley?
Yeah.
but what makes you think it's Daryn Kramer?
anybody could have grabbed this box and used it.
right, but that's why I love this job so much.
okay, you see this black trace right here?
Uh-huh.
black cocaine.
all right, maybe we should ask Daryn Kramer some questions
you took the words right out of my mouth.
you know, maybe I'm not being clear.
I dumped my garbage.
I put the box next to the dumpster.
now I'm not a drug dealer and I'm not a drug user.
I'm a biochemist.
so when you were dumping the box in the alley, did you interrupt anything, maybe a drug buy?
no.
did you use the surface of the box To cut your cocaine, Daryn?
you know what?
I agreed to come down here.
now, you got something to arrest me for, then do it otherwise, excuse me.
you know, I have traces of cocaine on a box with your name on it, a man found dead in a warehouse just around the corner from where you live, and that same cocaine at the crime scene.
we've arrested people for a lot less.
now sit down, Daryn.
even the littlest detail is gonna make things a lot easier for you, so why don't you just start at the beginning.
look, I'm trying to tell you.
I went to empty my garbage.
wait a minute.
I-I-I remember bumping into a guy.
he dropped a box, everything came out-- office supplies, printer cartridges.
I offered to help him pick it all up.
he didn't want my help and he took off.
I dumped my garbage in the dumpster, walked back to the apartment, that's it.
that's enough.
Hey, Mac,
I managed to get an accurate I. D. On the round.
hydra shock 147 jhp.
used in a glock.
shell casing would have been ejected.
we didn't find any at the scene.
if the killer made the effort to take the bullet out of the wound, he certainly picked up the shell casings.
Yeah, but that's a big place.
he'd have to search for them. Why take that time?
because you know the casing and the bullet will lead to a match in ibis
which is any gun used in a previous crime.
or a test-fired, police department issued weapon so Kramer's working with the computer sketchartist to see if he can I. D. The guy he bumped into
what's up?
I-I don't know. I...
is he watching us?
who?
the kid-- the kid in the hood.
Hey, kid?
Hey! Hey!
Hey!
what the hell was that about? Who is this kid?
I don't know.
you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
just forget it, Danny.
this is the most accurate reading we can get off the surface of the fragment
down to the tiniest indentation.
we know the bullet has glock rifling characteristics and...twelve potential matches.
all are police-issue weapons.
can we narrow that down?
well, I can do a manual comparison, that's gonna take some time.
of the twelve, were any of the detectives involved in the raid?
two. Want to bring them in?
not right now.
we start asking questions, it'll just turn into a drawn- out internal affairs circus
I need to know without a doubt which of the two is our shooter.
I need Flack's memo book.
check this out.
all right, there you go.
it's a piece of the moon.
a moon rock.
Yeah, this rock is-is from the moon.
from the moon? -Outer space.
get out of here.
Wow.
how does a piece of the moon end up in the alley?
I-I-I don't know;
this stuff is illegal to have and somebody went to a lot of trouble to get it
I mean, I've seen this stuff listed on ebay before, you know, and most of it isn't real, but if it is, short of going to the moon they would've had to steal it from nasa.
something happened in that alley.
and I don't think it has anything to do with what happened in the warehouse.
we've got a match from the print I lifted off that box we found in the alley.
not what I expecteD.
print is from a woman.
come on, come on, turn around, so I can see your face.
come on.
turn around.
have we id'd our shooter yet?
no, uh...
but he was carrying a police-issue weapon.
which supports narcotics and ballistics evidence that suggest it was one of the guys in the raiD.
right.
this is really bizarre.
okay, th-this whole case is crazy.
would you care to elaborate.
the print that danny got off the box that you guys found in the alley is a match to a Trina Roubian.
does her criminal background connect to drugs?
no, it wasn't a hit in afis.
found the print and the name in the Columbia university geological research foundation database
but get this, okay?
she hasn't worked there for a couple of years.
she's a missing person. Case file's still open.
Danny just took off to go talk to the husband.
so we have two missing persons in this case:
Trina Roubian and Cyrus Menlo, and they were both in that alley.
and now they're both gone. Poof.
so is this a conjugal visit? Huh?
you're trying to screw me again?
how many kilos of cocaine were in the apartment the night we arrested you, Lamont?
don't you know?
you was there.
how many kilos, Lamont?
you can't just come in here asking me questions like that and just expect to pay for parking.
man, you got to at least see that I get some twinkies and stamps on my commissary.
and that's just for starters.
I can do that.
I can also look into maybe getting you a transfer somewhere closer to the city.
53 kilos.
you're sure?
I'm a dealer.
you know what you have and what you don't have.
you know what you sold and what you've been paid for.
50 keys, Flack.
53 keys. Exactly.
thank you for coming in.
you know where my wife is?
you know where Trina is?
no, no we don'T.
but we do know she's still alive.
now is there anything that you can tell me about her that might help us?
no.
I mean, the last time I saw her was three years ago.
I don't know what I'd tell you.
she just... didn't come home from work one day.
it says that you didn't report her missing for a week
because she'd stay at work for days at a time.
Trina was a geologist, unfortunately...
her work was a little more fascinating than I was.
to tell you the truth,
I would have felt better if she had told me there was another man -Was there? -No.
all right, did you bring the picture? -Yeah.
Thanks.
I think I talked to her.
Yeah. Nice.
apartment 102.
but she was the one that said she was abducted by aliens.
Yeah. Only her name wasn't Trina Roubian. It was Verna Welke.
verna Welke? -Yes?
I've come for the alien.
finally.
protects you.
so they can't read your mind.
we're good. Thanks.
okay.
that's him. That's Cyrus Menlo.
he's cold.
but I got a pulse.
Hey, central, I need a bus at 1717 57th street, apartment 102 and put a rush on it.
the plastic keeps their temperature down.
prevents them from communicating with each other.
I'm detective Bonasera. Paramedics are on the way.
we're going to get you out of here, buddy.
he was here to plant pods.
co-mingle with the human race.
paintballs.
isn't he beautiful?
I knew one day I'd catch one.
I set the bear trap about a week ago.
placed a moon rock nearby.
they're attracted to things from their own world.
from space.
then I heard the footsteps.
he wasn't an alien, Verna.
he was just a guy playing paintball in the alley.
I can understand how you can think that.
they have ways of fooling us.
but I saw the blood.
I could tell he was hurt.
I was afraid, so I hit him.
I used the box to drag him away.
then I put the box back where I found it.
she goes by Verna Welke now.
that was a character in a children's book that she was writing.
well, she's gonna be taken to the hospital to be evaluated.
would you like to speak to your wife before she leaves, mr. Roubian?
no. That's not my wife.
Trina's still missing.
did you guys catch the ranger game last night?
pretty awesome.
Hey.
you know why I'm here?
do you care about the consequences?
I know this isn't easy for you.
I'm not talking about me, Mac.
I'm talking about the hundreds of arrests this cop was involved in.
the thugs who are going to be screaming for an appeal because his credibility's in question
and the ones that are going to go free despite the fact they're guilty and he did everything by the booK.
I'm talking about child molesters, rapists, murderers.
Kym Tanaka's shooter stepped over his body and collected shell casings.
he stuck his fingers into the victim's shoulder wound to retrieve a bullet, all to save his own ass.
and he was there to sell drugs.
poison that destroys families, creates addicts out of babies in the womb, and accounts for twenty-three percent of the murders in this city.
don't make me subpoena your memo book, Don.
the consequences I care about...
are the cops who never cross the line.
who now have to face criticism and suspicion because one of their own forgot the oath we took.
whichever one of these guys is found guilty, I hope he goes away for a very long time.
because he disrespected the badge that you and I wear.
Hey.-Hey.
heard you found Cyrus Menlo.
Yeah, and he's going to be all right.
want to share a cab?
mac, we live on opposites sides of town.
but thank you.
mac, that's him.
that's the kid who's been following me.
Hey.
all right, take it easy.
why you following her?
what do you want?
who are you?
I'm Reed Garrett, all right,
I just...I wanted to talk to you.
Why?
you're Claire Conrad. -No.
you mean Claire Conrad Taylor?
she was my wife.
Claire died on 9/11.
she was in the world trade center.
all right, and the lady that I've been following?
um, that's a friend.
that's Stella Bonasera. We're both crime scene investigators.
Yeah, I got, I got an address from the adoption agency.
you know, and I saw her come out of the, come out of the apartment building about a week ago.
Saturday. She...
she stopped by to give me a gift for my birthday.
Yeah, I guess I was just...
so worried about, you know, what to say, how she would react.
I-I... it never even crossed my mind that it couldn't be her. You know.
why didn't you talk to her?
because I been waiting to talk to my mom since I was 12 years old
you know, my biological moM.
you know, when I saw her...
well, at least like, you know, who I thought was her and I got, I got scared.
you know, Claire talked about you a lot, she...
she always talked about how she wanted to find you when you were 18.
Yeah, well, then why'd she give me up for adoption?
she got pregnant very young.
your father was her high school sweetheart.
an abortion, uh...
she wouldn't have one and she wanted you to have a chance at a better life.
your parents know you're here?
Yeah, they're, uh, they're really great about all of this.
so what then, so do I have any half brothers and half sisters?
did you guys ever have any kids?
no.
What'd she look like?
she was, um, 5'6," athletic.
she had light brown hair, big blue eyes and, uh...
a crooked smile.
she looked a lot like, like you.
okay, I should really go.
wait, wait, um, why don't I
I'll give you my number here.
or you can give me yours.
Why?
I mean, I'm not related to you at all and what I came to find is already gone, so...
thanks for the soda.
I hope all... my days will be lit by your face
I hope all... the years will hold tight our promises
I don't want to be old and sleep alone an empty house is not a home
I don't want to be old and feel afraid
I don't want to be old and sleep alone an empty house is not a home
I don't want to be old and feel afraid...
Hey.
the old stomping ground.
it's been a while.
thanks for coming, Mac. You want something?
no, no, I'm still on the clock.
you sounded a little rattled on the phone.
everything okay?
I think somebody's following me.
what makes you think that?
I'm hearing footsteps and seeing shadows and glimpses of something or someone and...
look, I know this sounds crazy, but I really feel like I'm being watched.
this is at your place?
no, no, actually it's, uh...
as I go into work, twice on the subway, when I was shopping today.
when did this start?
Uh...about a week ago.
I first felt it, when I dropped off your birthday gift at your place.
well, I'll assign a patrol unit.
we'll have some guys outside your place.
no, no, that's not necessary.
okay.
a homicide on Lafayette.
come on, I'll drop you off at home, it's on the way.
no, no, it's okay.
I want to enjoy every last minute of my day off.
just telling you makes me feel a lot better, okay?
okay, I'll call you.
a little early for the Macy's thanksgiving day parade.
well, according to ms. Lorraine Hannaford, a century-old tradition doesn't just happen.
there's months of prep.
organizers inflate balloons, check for leaks, let their volunteers get a trial run at steering these things.
this big fella was scheduled for a test run tomorrow morning.
how'd our vic get in here?
must be some kind of security in this place.
security guard. Norman Baker.
says he was outside making his exterior rounds, came back, saw the door to the alley open, vic dead.
claims he didn't see or hear anything.
looks like our only witness is full of hot air.
expensive marker, top of the line equipment.
we got a paintball pro here.
we have a name?
no wallet, no id.
gunshot wound to the shoulder.
right at the scapula.
bullet's more than likely deformed-- little chance it'll get us a hit in ibis.
wound to the chest is a through and through
still looking for the bullet.
looks like we'll have to perform an autopsy, on our wounded soldier.
they build these balloons in sections and divide them into compartments.
Yeah, that would explain the limp arm.
and our bullet's somewhere inside all that polyurethane.
thought you might want to do the autopsy.
for old times sake.
this job is never boring.
all right.
the red in the green paint is definitely blood.
but I also found orange paintballs near the body in the warehouse and on the dumpster.
all right, so there was another paintball player in the alley.
maybe their friendly little game turned serious and mr. Green paint traded in his ammo for the real thing.
but then where did he go?
I mean if you just shot someone why would you run in this direction?
there's no way out.
got a dead end.
got a locked gate.
and this door is locked.
what about a car?
seems the only way in and out for a vehicle is blocked.
paint trail starts there leads here and then just stops.
I'm telling you, Stella, this guy got to this spot...
then poof.
he just disappeared.
more blood.
how you doing, sir?
did you hear or see anything strange in the alley last night?
well, that depends on what you consider strange.
I mean, is this New York city, or what?
good morning, miss, were you home last night?
are you with the government?
are you here about the aliens?
uh, I'm with the nypd.
I'm sorry I was...
whoosh, whoosh, whoosh. It was right under my window.
did you see anything?
no, I would never look out my window...
my son said he saw two guys running around with guns.
I thought he was making it up.
can I talk to him? He's with his mother today?
I get him every other day.
I went to bed around 8: 00.
those paintball guys are around here all the time making noise.
okay, thanks.
uh, I'll leave my card.
call if you think of something.
I'll just leave my card
I'll just leave my card.
thank you.
nine millimeter.
it's been a little tough going.
fragment's really beat up.
bullet must have ricocheted before it ended up in the balloon.
using the fragment,
I was able to reconstruct the bullet to get the general rifling characteristics of the gun that fired it.
five lands and grooves with a right hand twist, consistent with three different types of firearms.
I'm hoping the little striae that's there will get us a hit in ibis
anything on the security guard's weapon?
no match to the fragment, he was negative for gunshot residue.
we're no closer to the shooter, Mac.
and this tiny little piece of metal is all we got.
that looks fun.
bullet through the chest is what killed him.
it entered from the back and exited just below the xiphoid process of the sternum.
take a look at the entry wound.
traces of black powder inside the wound.
gunshot residue?
he was shot at close range?
I arrived at the same conclusion. -But?
but there were no powder burns or stippling on the clothing surrounding the wound
I sent a sample of the black trace to lindsay at the lab along with prints for an I. D.
Now...the most interesting part of this whole autopsy is the gunshot wound to the shoulder.
examine the wound cavity.
it appears torn and irregular.
there's a possibility the bullet was tumbling before it hit the victim
I was hoping to confirm that once I retrieved it, but it wasn't there.
what?
the wound cavity was empty.
the torn and irregular tissue is because our shooter...
removed the bullet?
do you know him?
Yeah, that's Kym.
that's Kym Tanaka. He started our team.
are you telling me he's dead?
I'm sorry.
when's the last time you saw him?
uh, last night around 9: 30, we were at this club entry playing pool, you know, drinking beers-- he was the first one to leave.
he said he had someplace to go.
A-actually, he said he had something to prove.
any idea what he meant by that?
Kym had this ongoing war with Cyrus Menlo.
both were at the top of their game in professional paintball.
major competitors.
did they take that attitude off the field?
sometimes, yeah, but yesterday, most definitely.
stay out of my face, you hear me?
let's get out of here, Kym, come on.
any day, Cyrus. Come on.
I'll take you on any day.
this Cyrus Menlo, where can we find him?
well, he had a game here earlier today...
but they said he didn't show.
we're gonna need a full description of this guy
no problem.
that's him.
Cyrus Menlo is M. I.A.
we got half the nypd looking for him.
none of his teammates or his family have seen him since yesterday.
his father is adamant that Cyrus wouldn't have done something like this
he was even willing to give us a piece of his clothing.
now, dna from the epithelials were a match to the blood that Danny found in the green paint in the alley.
I guess mr. Menlo doesn't know how competitive his son is.
the black trace that Sid found in the gunshot wound of Kym Tanaka...
is not gun shot residue.
he got the same negative results from trace I collected off the crate at the scene
so, if it's not G. S.R?
it's black cocaine.
it's produced by mixing pure cocaine with ferric chloride or iron thiocyanate.
those chemicals turn the white cocaine powder to purple or black.
make them undetectable in field drug tests or by drug-sniffing dogs.
they usually hide and ship those drugs in printer toner cartridges.
get out of here.
you got to have a master's degree in chemistry just to run drugs these days.
Lindsay, check our narcotics database.
maybe we can track the origin of the coke, connect it to any previous seizures by its chemical make-up.
see if you can get us a warrant to search those boxes in the warehouse
I'm thinking our vic...
walked into a big money drug buy.
Yeah, that explains what happened to Kym Tanaka, but where's Cyrus Menlo?
Lindsay? -Yeah.
you okay?
I ran the chemical profileof the black cocaine against our internal database.
I got a match.
well, usually that's a good thing.
drugs with the exact same chemical make-up as the trace you found at the warehouse were confiscated in a raid six months ago.
they were held in nypd evidence and then destroyed.
all 50 kilos.
you double-checked this?
mac, I triple-checked it, and it's a highly unique blend of cocaine.
now we're finding traces of t hat same drug in a warehouse.
and I spoke with two dea both of whom witnessed the incineration of the drugs and the mixing agents.
even if somebody had the recipe and the ingredients, there's no way they could have come up with the exact same chemical profile.
means our guys at the raid didn't get the whole stash.
do you have the arrest report?
the lead detective credited with the bust was Flack.
it was a good raid. We got everything.
you're sure.
it was a dingy little apartment there in brooklyn over by the 77th.
we arrested three guys... -thanks, Hank.
we arrested three guys, confiscated 50 kilos of cocaine, all the cutting agents.
inside the apartment, we all split up and searched different areas.
found several glocks the kitchen table, all the expected drug paraphernalia.
did you find the drugs?
I was in the kitchen.
the drugs were hidden in a mattress in the bedroom.
which detective found the drugs?
I can't remember.
and you're sure it was just 50 kilos?
Yeah, we didn't miss anything, Mac.
Why? What's going on?
we found traces of cocaine at the warehouse last night with the same chemical make-up as the cocaine confiscated in your raid.
okay.
50 kilos along with cutting agents were secured as evidence and those same 50 kilos got destroyed.
if the drugs were recovered and then burned, it doesn't add up
if?
did you say "if"?
so you think there was more cocaine at that raid and someone-- one of my guys-- skimmed from the stash?
I'm just asking questions, Don.
no, you're not just asking questions, Mac, I know you.
you wouldn't be here talking to me if you hadn't already tracked the chain of custody, checked with property, and called the dea agents.
and let me tell you something.
cocaine from that raid wouldn't last six months on the street
so what is this? My interrogation?
you're overreacting. -Well, maybe I am, but let me save you a little bit of time.
none of my guys took a thing.
you can't be sure of that;you weren't there.
you just said you didn't remember.
it didn't happen, Mac.
you're listed on the dd-5 as the recorder at the scene.
you had to take everything down in your memo book.
every detective who was there, who searched the room, who found the drugs.
are you asking me for it?
you can check your notes or you can let me do it.
is this official business?
it's a request from a friend.
then I'm gonna have to think about it.
Hey, guys.
Hey, Danny, remember that rust stuff you found in the alley?
rust stuff? -Rust stuff?
can you respect the time it took me to collect that and at least call it trace?
okay, it contained traces of molasses and non-human blood, -bear blood to be exact. -What?
north american grizzly bear.
but, but there's more.
the blood on this rock is a match to Cyrus Menlo, but it's also a match to the blood found on these leaves.
both human blood, right?
right, but you put them together like this.
Shazaam.
you got one leaf with a hole in the middle of it.
a hole probably made from a spike or something with a jagged edge.
huh? Huh? See where I'm going here?
bear blood, molasses, leaves with human blood on them, a spike and a jagged edge. You're talking bear trap.
Yes, you win the washer and dryer.
Whoa-ho-ho, help me out here.
you're telling me that cyrus menlo was caught in a bear trap?
Yeah. -You're crazy.
it's the only conclusion we can arrive at with this evidence.
so Tanaka sets the bear trap, leads Cyrus Menlo down the alley, Tanaka goes into the warehouse.
Tanaka gets shot, Cyrus walks out, steps in the trap while Tanaka bleeds to death inside the warehouse.
moral of the story, all right?
stick with bowling.
what up?
okay, let's say we buy that story.
first of all, why didn't Tanaka just lead him into the trap?
he didn't need to go into the warehouse.
more importantly, if Cyrus Menlo were stuck in a bear trap, how did he get out of the alley?
the rust stuff.
there was directionality.
there were drag marks.
so he could have dragged himself out of there with the old rusty bear trap still on his leg
but we've checked all the hospitals and emergency rooms.
his family hasn't seen or heard from him.
I mean, if he got himself out of the alley, don't you think he'd go for some help?
not if he just whacked somebody.
well, it still begs the question: Where the hell is he?
I say we go back to where we know he was last.
let's look over the evidence from the alley.
thanks for confusing us.
you're welcome.
here's what you asked for. -Oh, thank you.
I see the look of victory.
who we taking down?
that's two doors down from the crime scene.
see these little pieces of paper?
they were crinkled together like an accordion.
they were stripped from the box because of friction underneath.
the box was dragged.
but there would need to be pressure on top.
like Cyrus Menlo's unconscious body?
it was a quick and easy way to get him out of there.
okay, so now you're saying that Cyrus Menlo was unconscious and dragged from the alley?
Yeah.
but what makes you think it's Daryn Kramer?
anybody could have grabbed this box and used it.
right, but that's why I love this job so much.
okay, you see this black trace right here?
Uh-huh.
black cocaine.
all right, maybe we should ask Daryn Kramer some questions
you took the words right out of my mouth.
you know, maybe I'm not being clear.
I dumped my garbage.
I put the box next to the dumpster.
now I'm not a drug dealer and I'm not a drug user.
I'm a biochemist.
so when you were dumping the box in the alley, did you interrupt anything, maybe a drug buy?
no.
did you use the surface of the box To cut your cocaine, Daryn?
you know what?
I agreed to come down here.
now, you got something to arrest me for, then do it otherwise, excuse me.
you know, I have traces of cocaine on a box with your name on it, a man found dead in a warehouse just around the corner from where you live, and that same cocaine at the crime scene.
we've arrested people for a lot less.
now sit down, Daryn.
even the littlest detail is gonna make things a lot easier for you, so why don't you just start at the beginning.
look, I'm trying to tell you.
I went to empty my garbage.
wait a minute.
I-I-I remember bumping into a guy.
he dropped a box, everything came out-- office supplies, printer cartridges.
I offered to help him pick it all up.
he didn't want my help and he took off.
I dumped my garbage in the dumpster, walked back to the apartment, that's it.
that's enough.
Hey, Mac,
I managed to get an accurate I. D. On the round.
hydra shock 147 jhp.
used in a glock.
shell casing would have been ejected.
we didn't find any at the scene.
if the killer made the effort to take the bullet out of the wound, he certainly picked up the shell casings.
Yeah, but that's a big place.
he'd have to search for them. Why take that time?
because you know the casing and the bullet will lead to a match in ibis
which is any gun used in a previous crime.
or a test-fired, police department issued weapon so Kramer's working with the computer sketchartist to see if he can I. D. The guy he bumped into
what's up?
I-I don't know. I...
is he watching us?
who?
the kid-- the kid in the hood.
Hey, kid?
Hey! Hey!
Hey!
what the hell was that about? Who is this kid?
I don't know.
you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
just forget it, Danny.
this is the most accurate reading we can get off the surface of the fragment
down to the tiniest indentation.
we know the bullet has glock rifling characteristics and...twelve potential matches.
all are police-issue weapons.
can we narrow that down?
well, I can do a manual comparison, that's gonna take some time.
of the twelve, were any of the detectives involved in the raid?
two. Want to bring them in?
not right now.
we start asking questions, it'll just turn into a drawn- out internal affairs circus
I need to know without a doubt which of the two is our shooter.
I need Flack's memo book.
check this out.
all right, there you go.
it's a piece of the moon.
a moon rock.
Yeah, this rock is-is from the moon.
from the moon? -Outer space.
get out of here.
Wow.
how does a piece of the moon end up in the alley?
I-I-I don't know;
this stuff is illegal to have and somebody went to a lot of trouble to get it
I mean, I've seen this stuff listed on ebay before, you know, and most of it isn't real, but if it is, short of going to the moon they would've had to steal it from nasa.
something happened in that alley.
and I don't think it has anything to do with what happened in the warehouse.
we've got a match from the print I lifted off that box we found in the alley.
not what I expecteD.
print is from a woman.
come on, come on, turn around, so I can see your face.
come on.
turn around.
have we id'd our shooter yet?
no, uh...
but he was carrying a police-issue weapon.
which supports narcotics and ballistics evidence that suggest it was one of the guys in the raiD.
right.
this is really bizarre.
okay, th-this whole case is crazy.
would you care to elaborate.
the print that danny got off the box that you guys found in the alley is a match to a Trina Roubian.
does her criminal background connect to drugs?
no, it wasn't a hit in afis.
found the print and the name in the Columbia university geological research foundation database
but get this, okay?
she hasn't worked there for a couple of years.
she's a missing person. Case file's still open.
Danny just took off to go talk to the husband.
so we have two missing persons in this case:
Trina Roubian and Cyrus Menlo, and they were both in that alley.
and now they're both gone. Poof.
so is this a conjugal visit? Huh?
you're trying to screw me again?
how many kilos of cocaine were in the apartment the night we arrested you, Lamont?
don't you know?
you was there.
how many kilos, Lamont?
you can't just come in here asking me questions like that and just expect to pay for parking.
man, you got to at least see that I get some twinkies and stamps on my commissary.
and that's just for starters.
I can do that.
I can also look into maybe getting you a transfer somewhere closer to the city.
53 kilos.
you're sure?
I'm a dealer.
you know what you have and what you don't have.
you know what you sold and what you've been paid for.
50 keys, Flack.
53 keys. Exactly.
thank you for coming in.
you know where my wife is?
you know where Trina is?
no, no we don'T.
but we do know she's still alive.
now is there anything that you can tell me about her that might help us?
no.
I mean, the last time I saw her was three years ago.
I don't know what I'd tell you.
she just... didn't come home from work one day.
it says that you didn't report her missing for a week
because she'd stay at work for days at a time.
Trina was a geologist, unfortunately...
her work was a little more fascinating than I was.
to tell you the truth,
I would have felt better if she had told me there was another man -Was there? -No.
all right, did you bring the picture? -Yeah.
Thanks.
I think I talked to her.
Yeah. Nice.
apartment 102.
but she was the one that said she was abducted by aliens.
Yeah. Only her name wasn't Trina Roubian. It was Verna Welke.
verna Welke? -Yes?
I've come for the alien.
finally.
protects you.
so they can't read your mind.
we're good. Thanks.
okay.
that's him. That's Cyrus Menlo.
he's cold.
but I got a pulse.
Hey, central, I need a bus at 1717 57th street, apartment 102 and put a rush on it.
the plastic keeps their temperature down.
prevents them from communicating with each other.
I'm detective Bonasera. Paramedics are on the way.
we're going to get you out of here, buddy.
he was here to plant pods.
co-mingle with the human race.
paintballs.
isn't he beautiful?
I knew one day I'd catch one.
I set the bear trap about a week ago.
placed a moon rock nearby.
they're attracted to things from their own world.
from space.
then I heard the footsteps.
he wasn't an alien, Verna.
he was just a guy playing paintball in the alley.
I can understand how you can think that.
they have ways of fooling us.
but I saw the blood.
I could tell he was hurt.
I was afraid, so I hit him.
I used the box to drag him away.
then I put the box back where I found it.
she goes by Verna Welke now.
that was a character in a children's book that she was writing.
well, she's gonna be taken to the hospital to be evaluated.
would you like to speak to your wife before she leaves, mr. Roubian?
no. That's not my wife.
Trina's still missing.
did you guys catch the ranger game last night?
pretty awesome.
Hey.
you know why I'm here?
do you care about the consequences?
I know this isn't easy for you.
I'm not talking about me, Mac.
I'm talking about the hundreds of arrests this cop was involved in.
the thugs who are going to be screaming for an appeal because his credibility's in question
and the ones that are going to go free despite the fact they're guilty and he did everything by the booK.
I'm talking about child molesters, rapists, murderers.
Kym Tanaka's shooter stepped over his body and collected shell casings.
he stuck his fingers into the victim's shoulder wound to retrieve a bullet, all to save his own ass.
and he was there to sell drugs.
poison that destroys families, creates addicts out of babies in the womb, and accounts for twenty-three percent of the murders in this city.
don't make me subpoena your memo book, Don.
the consequences I care about...
are the cops who never cross the line.
who now have to face criticism and suspicion because one of their own forgot the oath we took.
whichever one of these guys is found guilty, I hope he goes away for a very long time.
because he disrespected the badge that you and I wear.
Hey.-Hey.
heard you found Cyrus Menlo.
Yeah, and he's going to be all right.
want to share a cab?
mac, we live on opposites sides of town.
but thank you.
mac, that's him.
that's the kid who's been following me.
Hey.
all right, take it easy.
why you following her?
what do you want?
who are you?
I'm Reed Garrett, all right,
I just...I wanted to talk to you.
Why?
you're Claire Conrad. -No.
you mean Claire Conrad Taylor?
she was my wife.
Claire died on 9/11.
she was in the world trade center.
all right, and the lady that I've been following?
um, that's a friend.
that's Stella Bonasera. We're both crime scene investigators.
Yeah, I got, I got an address from the adoption agency.
you know, and I saw her come out of the, come out of the apartment building about a week ago.
Saturday. She...
she stopped by to give me a gift for my birthday.
Yeah, I guess I was just...
so worried about, you know, what to say, how she would react.
I-I... it never even crossed my mind that it couldn't be her. You know.
why didn't you talk to her?
because I been waiting to talk to my mom since I was 12 years old
you know, my biological moM.
you know, when I saw her...
well, at least like, you know, who I thought was her and I got, I got scared.
you know, Claire talked about you a lot, she...
she always talked about how she wanted to find you when you were 18.
Yeah, well, then why'd she give me up for adoption?
she got pregnant very young.
your father was her high school sweetheart.
an abortion, uh...
she wouldn't have one and she wanted you to have a chance at a better life.
your parents know you're here?
Yeah, they're, uh, they're really great about all of this.
so what then, so do I have any half brothers and half sisters?
did you guys ever have any kids?
no.
What'd she look like?
she was, um, 5'6," athletic.
she had light brown hair, big blue eyes and, uh...
a crooked smile.
she looked a lot like, like you.
okay, I should really go.
wait, wait, um, why don't I
I'll give you my number here.
or you can give me yours.
Why?
I mean, I'm not related to you at all and what I came to find is already gone, so...
thanks for the soda.
I hope all... my days will be lit by your face
I hope all... the years will hold tight our promises
I don't want to be old and sleep alone an empty house is not a home
I don't want to be old and feel afraid
I don't want to be old and sleep alone an empty house is not a home
I don't want to be old and feel afraid...
I don't want to be old and feel afraid...
final boarding call for flight 401 to New York's JFK Airport.
all passengers should be onboard at this time.
new York.
looks like someone's going to miss you.
enjoy your flight.
thank you.
folks, we'll be circling over Manhattan for a few minutes...
detective Taylor, there's an urgent call for you.
if you'll just follow me...
thank you.
detective Taylor.
Hey, Mac, we got a crime scene at the statue of liberty.
there'll be a helicopter on the tarmac waiting for you.
welcome back to the land of the free and the home of the depraved.
you didn't actually think we'd let you get settled, did you?
any clue what this is about?
got a lot of guesses, but nothing's confirmed.
lady liberty isn't our only victim.
what do we got, Sheldon?
liberty Island security.
current theory is that our security guard interrupts the act of vandalism, a fight breaks out.
vandal wins the fight, slashes her throat, deep laceration transecting the carotid artery.
go ahead, John.
knife cut from left to right.
cause of death is exsanguination.
you find her gun? - Not yet.
I just got word that there's a male security guard unaccounted for.
guy by the name of Charles Price.
he was on duty last night.
any evidence he was up here?
Stella might have the answer to that question.
so what are we looking at, detective?
evidence of sexual activity.
nothing's sacred anymore.
who would do something like this?
someone desperate to get his message across.
what's the verdict?
Oh! Welcome to the party, Mac.
what do we have, Danny?
uh, there are 12 different samples, all of them blood.
but there's way too much out here to be from the vic.
hers is all on the floor inside.
send it back to the lab, let's see if it's human.
Yeah, right away.
directionality of the spatter is consistent with arterial spray.
except for these two isolated blood drops here.
well, maybe our killer was injured.
Yeah, it's possible.
except there's no blood trail that leads out of here.
looks like these two drops took a right turn.
how many do you have?
a dozen overlapping fingerprints in the plexiglas.
I'm gonna have them sent over to the lab along with the blood samples I collected from the face of the statue and trace evidence from our vic.
did you say blood?
the news is reporting that it's paint.
we're dealing with a serious psychopath.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I just hope it's not human blood.
tell Adam to drop everything.
this is top priority.
he's not here.
I'll find him.
I'll see you back at the lab.
Hi, I'm calling from the office of unemployment.
Oh, Lindsay, hey.
word is that Denny's is looking to hire some socially awkward scientists.
I-I'm halfway there already. Okay?
it's a big case, Adam.
it's the Statue of Liberty, it's all over the news.
we've got a lot of work to do.
this is top priority, and Mac's back in town.
get your little ass to work.
discovered this morning at ground level...
uh, Kendall. Hey, uh, wake up.
uh, we're late for work.
we got to get up, we're late for... - Did we...? We didn't...?
Oh, no, no, no. I mean, I...
I mean, I wish it was yes, yes, yes, but, sadly, no.
okay. Ten more minutes.
no, no, no. No more minutes.
okay, come on, get up.
get up, come on, let's go.
Oh. Up, up, yes, let's go.
must fight crime.
you okay?
Yeah.
just... a little jet-lagged.
I'll be fine.
london was good?
Peyton's happy?
perfect.
it was nice meeting her family.
she's staying in london a few more weeks.
what, you're not buying the jet lag story?
look, Mac, I tried to get a hold of you at the hotel and they said that you checked out early.
I got a few strange phone calls on my hotel room phone.
Hello?
Hello?
couple of seconds of dead silence, then they'd hang up.
wrong number?
each call came at exactly 3: 33 A. M.
Hello?
who is this?
wasn't sure what to make of it, so I switched hotels.
I got three more calls at the new hotel, all at 3: 33.
who is this?
say something, damn it.
scotland yard tried to trace the calls. Got nowhere.
there's no witnesses.
and no surveillance.
doesn't make sense, right?
cause after 9/11 we all know that a $36 million security system was installed on this island.
here's the kicker: Once every three months, they shut down for system upgrades and reboots.
takes 45 minutes.
small window of opportunity.
no one's that lucky.
you know, I'm liking the missing security guard for this one.
I'm right there with you.
just the same, I got uniforms compiling a list of all personnel as well as any maintenance and electrical crews that have access to the island.
but here's the good news:
bomb squad did a search of the perimeter and the statue, it's all clean.
so we're not looking at a terrorist threat.
detectives.
there's blood on the coin slot.
Yeah, I always like to do a little sightseeing after I commit murder.
this wire is holding the viewfinder in place.
maybe we're the ones who are supposed to do the sightseeing.
there's a man on a rooftop.
it's him.
what?
he's watching us.
all right, listen up.
we got an unknown male, possibly our suspect, on a roof across the river.
now I need aviation to the tip of Battery Park immediately.
and I want all available units heading towards Whitehall Street standby for exact location.
this guy hasn't moved an inch.
Flack, cancel the squad cars.
send for the coroner.
this guy's dead.
this guy isn't our missing security guard.
so Charles Price is still in the wind.
then who is he?
and what connection does he have to Georgia Morrison?
I don't know, but our killer wanted us to find him.
am I crazy, or is he orange?
he was definitely injected with some kind of orange substance, but...that is not a needle mark.
got another one over here.
I'm not looking at a gunshot wound.
these holes are inconsistent with a through and through.
2 more will die.
I printed your vic.
his name is Damion Brock, on parole for money laundering.
I'll start with the orange substance.
the two holes in his neck are indicative of the embalming process.
two catheters are inserted into the neck and the embalming fluid is pumped into the system as the blood is drained out.
he was embalmed?
in a sense, only instead of embalming fluid, your killer used a household cleaning fluid.
orange spruce-scented, to be precise.
there is something else.
I recovered this from the victim's throat.
before you ask, I have no idea what it is.
there are tiny, braille-like bumps on the surface.
now, if you'll look closely, there is a hairline fracture to the skull here, but not enough damage to kill him.
so you're still looking for C. O.D as well as time of death.
I did take a buccal swab and compared it to danny's samples from the scene.
it's a match to the blood found on the statue of liberty which means he's most likely our first victim.
blood was drained and poured over the statue.
our second victim, Georgia Morrison.
two more will die.
that means there's a third victim.
missing security guard?
not if he's our killer.
do I get a hint?
can we play 20 Questions?
it's neither animal nor vegetable.
actually, it was shoved down our vic's throat, so it has to have some significance.
the bumps aren't braille.
sequencing doesn't match.
Oh, good. Stella.
I have a little information on the wire from the viewfinder.
it's from a piano.
piano wire, that's strange.
that's typically used in higher notes, using the contact points, plating separation and an average applied tension of 67 pounds, I was able to figure out what note it is.
you know what note it is?
Yeah. It's an "A."
were you able to determine what kind of piano?
well, um, this particular wire is plated with a tin - phosphorus sulfate.
that's common in high-end european-brand pianos.
sulphate preserves the timbre of the wire.
so, it's either from a christofori or a richtendorf.
excellent work.
thank you, Kendall.
sure.
she gets a piano wire, I get a...bronze metal thing with bumps on it.
great.
Oh, good, Stella.
um, I have some information on the wire I found in the viewfinder.
I did.
I analyzed the trace you recovered from Georgia Morrison's neck wound.
it's plexiglas, same as the window that was cut out of the Statue of Liberty's crown.
so the instrument used to cut the glass was also used to cut georgia morrison's throat.
what about the trace I collected from her arm?
latex.
more specifically...candom spray.
excuse me, what?
I-I didn't catch that.
liquid rubber.
german engineering at its finest.
I'm not sure I understand.
well, allow me to demonstrate.
contrary to what you might have heard, science definitely does matter.
simply... apply, like so...
allow a few moments for a maximum drying time...
and... boom, instant condom.
are you serious?
a spray-on condom?
but where does it, uh... the...?
or how...?
never mind.
Stella did find evidence of sexual activity up by the torch.
so, maybe after the fireworks, whoever Georgia Morrison was spraying...killed her?
our missing security guard.
I don't know, guys. It doesn't make sense.
sex and murder I get, but vandalism...?
incompatible.
Charles Price was standing in front of her.
the drood blops deflected off his badge.
he didn't kill Georgia Morrison.
someone else was there.
Oh, good, Stella.
I got some information on the metal plate sid recovered.
okay.
it's part of a music box, or the, the guts of a music box, actually.
I was able to replicate it.
when you turn the crank, the thin metal tines brush against the bumps on the plate, creating a musical tone. hmm?
so, our killer shoved a piece of a music box down our male victim's throat.
do you know what song it is?
it's one of mozart's early compositions, a minuet and trio that he wrote in 1761 at the age of five, and I kinda figured it was like a, a weird choice for a music box, so I took the liberty of tracking down the owner by contacting local specialists.
it was custom-made for a Nova Kent.
you got a name.
that's huge.
Adam...really good work.
that's how I roll.
what up?!
Mozart wrote that in 1761 when he was five.
it's a beautiful song.
can I ask you where you found it?
we'll get to that.
do you know him?
hmm, no. No, I've never seen him before.
his name is Damion Brock.
should I know who that is?
a piece of your music box was shoved down his throat after he was murdered.
this just came for you.
thank you.
miss Kent...
miss Kent, it was a metal plate from a music box that you bought.
I lost that music box about a year ago.
are you kidding me?
you can't come up with a better lie than that?
I move a lot.
four different places in the past year.
I get rid of junk, throw things away.
you specifically requested that the music box play Mozart's First Minuet.
it seems strange that something with that kind of sentimental value would be...thrown away.
Yeah, well, I cried for three days when I realized it was gone.
you're killing me right now.
okay, look. I got people I got people waiting for me.
are we done here?
we're done.
good.
for now.
I found your, uh, missing security guard, Charles Price.
fingerprints match the ones on file with liberty island security.
boat propeller sever the arm?
in one quick swoosh.
two kids fishing off Battery Park got a little turf with their surf.
any idea where I can find the rest of him?
given the flow of currents this time of year-- Connecticut.
our victim was dead and floating before the arm was severed.
there was absence of bleeding in the capillaries...and, see these here?
abrasions.
body floats in the water face-down, arms drag below the torso, the knuckles scrape on the bottom, of the shallow shore.
trace evidence I found here on the back of the hand Lindsay confirmed as latex.
some kind of spray-on condom?
it must have been blowback from the aerosol canister.
same trace was found on our female security guard.
my guess is Charles Price and Georgia Morrison had sex on the torch, then on their way down the statue, interrupted our vandal, and that's when Georgia was murdered.
let her go! Let her go! - Drop the weapon or she's dead!
do it now!
drop it!
move!
why keep Charles Price alive?
he was the killer's ticket off the island.
uniformed security escort, no questions asked.
then, when he wasn't needed any longer, Charles was the next victim.
the killer followed through on his threat-- two more will die.
no, I don't think so, Sid.
Charles and Georgia surprised him.
that means they were unexpected casualties of the original plan.
explains why there's no apparent connection to our rooftop victim, Damion Brock.
there are two other people out there the killer wants dead.
we gotta get to them before he does.
Flack, just got your message.
well, they tracked down Damion Brock's parole officer.
this is the address he gave-- super's getting the keys.
Brock's P. O. Said he spoke to him the day before yesterday, and he was happy, and things were going well.
thinking of moving back to Texas when his parole was done.
he didn't detect anything out of the ordinary.
sounds like he kept his nose clean, straightened himself out.
Flack, I've been here before.
it was a crime scene-- a young woman was murdered.
still unsolved.
it's been about ten months.
actually, it was exactly a year ago, Detective Bonasera.
I was your primary suspect for a while there.
of course, Morton. I...
anyway... sorry it took me so long to find the keys.
Hey, Morton.
yeah?
when was the last time you saw Damion Brock?
I don't know, a week ago, maybe.
quiet guy.
very low-maintenance tenant.
does that smell like ammonia?
and death.
something definitely happened in this apartment.
did any of your tenants complain of hearing arguments or loud voices?
no.
don't tell me this is happening again.
nobody is gonna want to live in this building if this is happening again.
look, Morton, thank you, but we can take it from here, okay?
do you have any suspects?
do you have any idea who killed Marie?
I stay in touch with her family, and they ask all the time.
I know how much you cared about Marie.
I'm sorry, we don't have anything new right now.
well, let me know if you need anything.
well, this is definitely where he embalmed Damion Brock's body.
what point is this guy trying to make?
I have no idea.
please...
Oh, god!
please!
all right!
all right!
I could see from the stairs that it was a van.
a white van.
T-U... a th-three... a one... P... or B.
I saw that Southern accent-- that's Brock. - I swear to you I don't know!
that's the outgoing message.
there was no tone to transition to the incoming call.
means Brock and the killer were both here when he recorded it.
sounded like he was being tortured.
I think he embalmed Brock while he was still alive.
he knows we're here.
he saw the light go on-- he made the phone call to trigger the answering machine.
he knows where we are.
it's time to find out where he is.
I need a trace on a call made to a Damion Brock.
his home number: 212-555... so, fill me in.
you know who this guy is? - No.
and there's no apparent connection to Damion Brock.
at this point, they both have the killer in common.
this photo has a little bit of background in it.
does that mean anything to anybody?
take your pick.
no, the answers have to be in that photo.
he wouldn't include a picture with a background in it by accident.
he led us to the first victim; now he's leading us to the second.
so maybe this connects to some other evidence we have in the case.
well, we got piano wire, we got a music box, we got plexiglas, Mozart...music.
it's music.
that's not an "e," it's an "F."
alistair Friedman Hall.
it's a music hall-- this guy has a thing about music.
the letters are on the corner of a music stand.
alistair Friedman Hall's a big place.
those music stands could be from anywhere-- Julliard, Lincoln Center...all in one direction- uptown.
Danny, you're driving.
Stella, see if you can narrow down our target area.
Absolutely.
I just talked to Flack.
911 is connected to a call as we speak.
he said it's coming from the same phone that triggered Damion Brock's answering machine.
can we patch it in here and triangulate?
exactly what I was hoping.
this is the 911 operator.
your call is now connected.
come on, come on.
guys, Alistair Friedman Hall is in the 911 call's triangulation search area.
our victim and our killer are together.
we have a location.
all right, this is clear.
nobody's here.
this place is empty.
that's Danny's voice. - Yeah.
911 call's picking him up in the background.
Stella, we need direction.
there's nobody here-- are we in the right place?
you're definitely in the right place.
we can hear you guys on the 911 call.
they can hear us on the cell phone.
it's here someplace.
it's looking like a decoy, Mac.
hold on, Danny.
don't move.
Yeah, I hear that.
call an ambulance.
did you get an I. D. On the killer?
Nakashima died in the emergency room.
the killer cut his tongue out, Stella.
Hey, are you all right?
Nakashima's blood contained an excessive amount of Sodium Pentothal.
truth serum?
could be the cause of death.
so what did our killer want Lee Nakashima to tell the truth about?
dark hair...green eys...he had some facial hair.
Oh! So this footage was recovered from the cell phone we found with the vic.
killer tossed it in before he sealed it, hoping we'd find them both.
no prints on the phone other than Nakashima's.
paper trail on the purchase of the cell leads to phony names and addresses.
how does Damion Brock connect with Lee Nakashima?
or who did they both piss off?
let's focus on the victims, not the killer.
both these guys had a story to tell about something that hpeapned:
Brock on the answering machine; Nakashima on the cell phone.
something they saw-- and the killer wanted the truth.
but after he got the truth, he killed them.
right, because he got what he wanted, he didn't need them any longer.
Brock remembered a license plate; Nakashima gave a description of a man.
but why remember a license plate, or describe hair color or eye color or a scar?
because they were witnesses.
witnesses to a crime.
mac, iI f told you to go home and get some rest, you would say...?
what's in the box?
of course you would.
I think I may have found what we're looking for.
lee Nakashima lived in the same building as Damion Brock.
now, Lee moved out seven months ago, but they both lived in the building a year ago when Marie Casimira was murdered.
mac, that's the crime they witnessed.
one of them saw the killer's car and the other his face.
well, if we had that information then, why is the case unsolved?
well, they didn't come forward in the canvass.
Nakashima said he was sleeping; Brock said he wasn't home.
they didn't want to get involved for whatever reason.
and Brock's an ex-con.
Nakashima's here on a visa.
keep silent, don't complicate things.
somebody had to know the truth.
someone knew they witnessed a crime.
maybe Marie Casimira's killer.
maybe he saw them before he ran away from the crime scene.
there's no statute of limitations on murder.
and when you know there's two people out there who can identify you, you might get a little nervous wondering when that day will come.
solving Marie Casimira's case may answer everything.
okay, but what about the other witnesses our killer wants to silence?
two more will die.
Hey, guys.
Sid found this down Lee Nakashima's throat.
concert ticket.
the killer wanted us to find this, like the music box in brock's throat.
she's the next target.
where is she?
she went onstage ten minutes ago.
the world carries on without you but nothing remains the same, I'll be lost without you until the last of days until the last of days.
he wanted her to keep quiet.
she was scared.
what?
that's him.
thank you.
miss Kent, I'm detective Taylor.
we need you to come with us, please - it's okay.
got him? - Got him.
don't move.
I'm sorry I lied about losing the music box.
Marie was a close friend.
I gave it to her the day she died.
she was an amazing classical pianist.
so how did this flower guy end up with it?
I don't know.
why didn't you just go to the police?
I was too scared.
he saw me.
I saw him.
I traded silence for my life.
please don't kill me.
please...
I'll never tell.
I'll never tell.
he let me go.
for whatever reason, he let me live.
I thought it was over, but two months later I realized it would never be over.
he started sending me black calla lilies.
so you kept moving to get away.
but he always found me.
I wanted to tell somebody so bad.
I thought about it every single day.
I was...
I was just too scared.
I didn't want to die.
I am telling you for the 1, 500th time I don't know who these guys are!
I didn't kill them, and I've never been to the Statue of Liberty ever.
Anthony, come on.
you went to the concert tonight to finish the job.
Nakashima, Brock, and Nova could all identify you as the man who killed Marie Casimira.
and you juld coustn't live knowing that could happen at any given moment on any day.
no.
I just want to let you know that we have a suspect in custody in Marie's case.
that's good.
I'm glad.
it's been a long year.
well, I'm sorry about what happened, Morton.
it's just that we had to be sure.
I couldn't have killed her, I loved her.
that's a partial license plate.
that's the flower delivery van you were driving the night you killed Marie Casimira.
Brock saw it, Nakashima gave a description.
Nova saw you, you saw them all.
I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say the jury's probably not gonna buy the twin tulip van defense.
I didn't kill them!
you're being charged with four murders.
if you're lucky enough to escape the death penalty, that's four life sentences.
coming clean could be the difference between living and dying.
have a think on that.
I only saw her.
Nova-- I wanted to make sure she was keeping her mouth shut.
I went there to scare her, not to kill her.
why tonight?
I got a phone call saying she was talking to the police.
I want a lawyer.
Marie's parents will be really glad to know that justice has been served.
I gotta figure out how to say that in Italian.
perfect.
what do you think?
we have any physical evidence that puts him in the statue of liberty or Damion Brock's apartment?
no, we're still collecting trace, but you believe him?
I believe a year ago he killed Marie Casimira, but the rest doesn't add up.
mac, we just ran Colton's cell records.
there's an incoming call from the same phone that we found on Lee Nakashima.
so unless this guy Colton is playing games, and calling himself...
all right, I think our friend in there is gonna stick with his lies, so I'm gonna go rattle the public defender on call.
this guy didn't kill Nakashima or Brock.
are you telling me that we got the wrong guy?
Flack, why would Colton coerce his victims into confessing details of a crime that identifies him as the killer then leave that information at the scene for the police to find?
it doesn't make sense.
wait a minute.
a dead guy can't lock his door.
and the only way to lock a deadbolt's from the outside with a key.
you play piano?
I'm taking lessons.
Marie inspired me, actually.
it's her piano.
it's beautiful.
it's from a piano.
it's an A.
don't move.
no, no!
stop!
Morton, step into the light and put your hands up!
I tried to tell everyone there were witnesses, but nobody was listening.
people saw what happened to Marie and they said nothing.
they were cowards.
Morton, I don't want to see either one of us get hurt, all right?
there's other ways to go about this.
routine-- that's how I knew.
I mean, Nakashima, he watches everything, staring out his window， complaining about every move his neighbors make.
and Brock, Brock sits out on his little ledge smoking every night, and the smell of his tobacco drifts down into my apartment.
I knew he was there.
it is amazing what people will remember when confronted with death.
I made those cowards talk.
it was the only way to get at the truth and to lead you to her killer.
that's when you knew Nova Kent had seen the whole thing.
Brock said that a girl ran away.
that was Nova, right?
she was her friend.
how could she not say something?
how do you see something like that and not say anything?
how do you let an innocent man be accused of a crime he didn't commit?
I did not kill Marie.
what about the statue of liberty, Morton?
for Marie.
she deserved something big.
it was easy. I snuck on the island with an electrical crew when they were doing the security reboot and I made my move.
did you see all of the media coverage?
you would still be sitting in your office thumbing through your case file if I hadn't gotten your attention.
can you hear me now?
loud and clear, Morton.
mac, what are you still doing here?
I'm still on london time.
it's breakfast.
you just finish with Morton Brite?
he's at Central Booking.
the Statue of Liberty was a way to get our attention.
the strangest thing?
even after he knew who killed Marie, never crossed his mind to go after Anthony Colton.
for some, the greatest sin is to turn away and do nothing.
go home.
Yeah.
final boarding call for flight 401 to New York's JFK airport.
all passengers should be onboard at this time.
new York.
looks like someone's going to miss you.
enjoy your flight.
thank you.
folks, we'll be circling over Manhattan for a few minutes...
detective Taylor, there's an urgent call for you.
if you'll just follow me...
thank you.
detective Taylor.
Hey, Mac, we got a crime scene at the Statue of Liberty.
there'll be a helicopter on the tarmac waiting for you.
welcome back to the land of the free and the home of the depraved.
you didn't actually think we'd let you get settled, did you?
any clue what this is about?
got a lot of guesses, but nothing's confirmed.
lady Liberty isn't our only victim.
what do we got, Sheldon?
liberty island security.
current theory is that our security guard interrupts the act of vandalism, a fight breaks out.
vandal wins the fight.
slashes her throat.
deep laceration transecting the carotid artery.
go ahead, John.
knife cut from left to right.
cause of death is exsanguination.
you find her gun? - Not yet.
I just got word that there's a male security guard unaccounted for.
guy by the name of Charles Price.
he was on duty last night.
any evidence he was up here?
Stella might have the answer to that question.
so what are we looking at, detective?
evidence of sexual activity.
nothing's sacred anymore.
who would do something like this?
someone desperate to get his message across.
what's the verdict?
Oh! Welcome to the party, Mac.
what do we have, Danny?
uh, there are 12 different samples, all of them blood.
but there's way too much out here to be from the vic.
hers is all on the floor inside.
send it back to the lab, let's see if it's human.
Yeah, right away.
directionality of the spatter is consistent with arterial spray.
except for these two isolated blood drops here.
well, maybe our killer was injured.
Yeah, it's possible.
except there's no blood trail that leads out of here.
looks like these two drops took a right turn.
how many do you have?
a dozen overlapping fingerprints in the plexiglas.
I'm gonna have them sent over to the lab along with the blood samples I collected from the face of the statue and trace evidence from our vic.
did you say blood?
the news is reporting that it's paint.
we're dealing with a serious psychopath.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I just hope it's not human blood.
tell Adam to drop everything.
this is top priority.
he's not here.
I'll find him.
I'll see you back at the lab.
Hi, I'm calling from the office of unemployment.
Oh, Lindsay, hey.
word is that Denny's is looking to hire some socially awkward scientists.
I-I'm halfway there already. Okay?
it's a big case, Adam.
it's the statue of liberty, it's all over the news.
we've got a lot of work to do.
this is top priority, and Mac's back in town.
get your little ass to work.
discovered this morning at ground level...
uh, Kendall. Hey, uh, wake up.
uh, we're late for work.
we got to get up, we're late for... - did we...? We didn't...?
Oh, no, no, no. I mean, I...
I mean, I wish it was yes, yes, yes, but, sadly, no.
okay. Ten more minutes.
no, no, no. No more minutes.
okay, come on, get up.
get up, come on, let's go.
Oh. Up, up, yes, let's go.
must fight crime.
you okay?
Yeah.
just... a little jet-lagged.
I'll be fine.
london was good?
Peyton's happy?
perfect.
it was nice meeting her family.
she's staying in london a few more weeks.
what, you're not buying the jet lag story?
look, Mac, I tried to get ahold of you at the hotel and they said that you checked out early.
I got a few strange phone calls on my hotel room phone.
Hello?
Hello?
couple of seconds of dead silence, then they'd hang up.
wrong number?
each call came at exactly 3: 33 A. M.
Hello?
who is this?
wasn't sure what to make of it, so I switched hotels.
I got three more calls at the new hotel, all at 3: 33.
who is this?
say something, damn it.
scotland Yard tried to trace the calls. Got nowhere.
there's no witnesses.
and no surveillance.
doesn't make sense, right?
cause after 9/11 we all know that a $36 million security system was installed on this island.
here's the kicker: Once every three months, they shut down for system upgrades and reboots.
takes 45 minutes.
small window of opportunity.
no one's that lucky.
you know, I'm liking the missing security guard for this one.
I'm right there with you.
just the same, I got uniforms compiling a list of all personnel as well as any maintenance and electrical crews that have access to the island.
but here's the good news:
bomb squad did a search of the perimeter and the statue, it's all clean.
so we're not looking at a terrorist threat.
detectives.
there's blood on the coin slot.
Yeah, I always like to do a little sightseeing after I commit murder.
this wire is holding the viewfinder in place.
maybe we're the ones who are supposed to do the sightseeing.
there's a man on a rooftop.
it's him.
what?
he's watching us.
all right, listen up.
we got an unknown male, possibly our suspect, on a roof across the river.
now I need aviation to the tip of battery park immediately.
and I want all available units heading towards Whitehall Street.
standby for exact location.
this guy hasn't moved an inch.
Flack, cancel the squad cars.
send for the coroner.
this guy's dead.
this guy isn't our missing security guard.
so Charles Price is still in the wind.
then who is he?
and what connection does he have to Georgia Morrison?
I don't know, but our killer wanted us to find him.
am I crazy, or is he orange?
he was definitely injected with some kind of orange substance, but...
that is not a needle mark.
got another one over here.
I'm not looking at a gunshot wound.
these holes are inconsistent with a through and through.
2 more will die.
I printed your vic.
his name is Damion Brock, on parole for money laundering.
I'll start with the orange substance.
the two holes in his neck are indicative of the embalming process.
two catheters are inserted into the neck and the embalming fluid is pumped into the system as the blood is drained out.
he was embalmed?
in a sense, only instead of embalming fluid, your killer used a household cleaning fluid.
orange spruce-scented, to be precise.
there is something else.
I recovered this from the victim's throat.
before you ask, I have no idea what it is.
there are tiny, braille-like bumps on the surface.
now, if you'll look closely, there is a hairline fracture to the skull here.
but not enough damage to kill him.
so you're still looking for C. O.D.
as well as time of death.
I did take a buccal swab and compared it to Danny's samples from the scene.
it's a match to the blood found on the statue of liberty.
which means he's most likely our first victim.
blood was drained and poured over the statue.
our second victim, Georgia Morrison.
two more will die.
that means there's a third victim.
missing security guard?
not if he's our killer.
do I get a hint?
can we play 20 questions?
it's neither animal nor vegetable.
actually, it was shoved down our vic's throat, so it has to have some significance.
the bumps aren't braille.
sequencing doesn't match.
Oh, good. Stella.
I have a little information on the wire from the viewfinder.
it's from a piano.
piano wire, that's strange.
that's typically used in higher notes.
using the contact points, plating separation and an average applied tension of 67 pounds,
I was able to figure out what note it is.
you know what note it is?
Yeah. It's an "A.
were you able to determine what kind of piano?
well, um, this particular wire is plated with a tin - phosphorus sulfate.
that's common in high-end European-brand pianos.
sulphate preserves the timbre of the wire.
so, it's either from a christofori or a richtendorf.
excellent work.
thank you, Kendall.
sure.
she gets a piano wire, I get a... bronze metal thing with bumps on it.
great.
Oh, good, Stella.
um, I have some information on the wire I found in the viewfinder.
I did.
I analyzed the trace you recovered from Georgia Morrison's neck wound.
it's plexiglas, same as the window that was cut out of the Statue of Liberty's crown.
so the instrument used to cut the glass was also used to cut georgia morrison's throat.
what about the trace I collected from her arm?
latex.
more specifically... condom spray.
excuse me, what?
I-I didn't catch that.
liquid rubber.
german engineering at its finest.
I'm not sure I understand.
well, allow me to demonstrate.
contrary to what you might have heard, science definitely does matter.
simply... apply, like so...
allow a few moments for a maximum drying time...
and... boom, instant condom.
are you serious?
a spray-on condom?
but where does it, uh... the...?
or how...?
never mind.
Stella did find evidence of sexual activity up by the torch.
so, maybe after the fireworks, whoever Georgia Morrison was spraying...killed her?
our missing security guard.
I don't know, guys. It doesn't make sense.
sex and murder I get, but vandalism...?
incompatible.
Charles Price was standing in front of her.
the drood blops deflected off his badge.
he didn't kill Georgia Morrison.
someone else was there.
Oh, good, Stella.
I got some information on the metal plate sid recovered.
okay.
it's part of a music box, or the, the guts of a music box, actually.
I was able to replicate it.
when you turn the crank, the thin metal tines brush against the bumps on the plate, creating a musical tone. Hmm?
so, our killer shoved a piece of a music box down our male victim's throat.
do you know what song it is?
it's one of Mozart's early compositions, a minuet and trio that he wrote in 1761 at the age of five, and I kinda figured it was like a, a weird choice for a music box, so I took the liberty of tracking down the owner by contacting local specialists.
it was custom-made for a Nova Kent.
you got a name.
that's huge.
Adam...really good work.
that's how I roll.
what up?!
Mozart wrote that in 1761 when he was five.
it's a beautiful song.
can I ask you where you found it?
we'll get to that.
do you know him?
hmm, no. No, I've never seen him before.
his name is Damion Brock.
should I know who that is?
a piece of your music box was shoved down his throat after he was murdered.
this just came for you.
thank you.
miss Kent...
miss Kent, it was a metal plate from a music box that you bought.
I lost that music box about a year ago.
are you kidding me?
you can't come up with a better lie than that?
I move a lot.
four different places in the past year.
I get rid of junk, throw things away.
you specifically requested that the music box play Mozart's first minuet.
it seems strange that something with that kind of sentimental value would be...thrown away.
Yeah, well, I cried for three days when I realized it was gone.
you're killing me right now.
okay, look. I got people waiting for me.
are we done here?
we're done.
good.
for now.
I found your, uh, missing security guard, Charles Price.
fingerprints match the ones on file with liberty island security.
boat propeller sever the arm?
in one quick swoosh.
two kids fishing off battery park got a little turf with their surf.
any idea where I can find the rest of him?
given the flow of currents this time of year-- Connecticut.
our victim was dead and floating before the arm was severed.
there was absence of bleeding in the capillaries...
and, see these here?
abrasions.
body floats in the water face-down, arms drag below the torso, the knuckles scrape on the bottom, of the shallow shore.
trace evidence I found here on the back of the hand lindsay confirmed as latex.
some kind of spray-on condom?
it must have been blowback from the aerosol canister.
same trace was found on our female security guard.
my guess is Charles Price and Georgia Morrison had sex on the torch, then on their way down the statue, interrupted our vandal, and that's when Georgia was murdered.
let her go! Let her go! - Drop the weapon or she's dead!
do it now!
drop it!
move!
why keep Charles Price alive?
he was the killer's ticket off the island.
uniformed security escort, no questions asked.
then, when he wasn't needed any longer, Charles was the next victim.
the killer followed through on his threat-- "two more will die."
no, I don't think so, Sid.
Charles and Georgia surprised him.
that means they were unexpected casualties of the original plan.
explains why there's no apparent connection to our rooftop victim, Damion Brock.
there are two other people out there the killer wants dead.
we gotta get to them before he does.
Flack, just got your message.
well, they tracked down Damion Brock's parole officer.
this is the address he gave-- super's getting the keys.
Brock's P. O. said he spoke to him the day before yesterday, and he was happy, and things were going well.
thinking of moving back to Texas when his parole was done.
he didn't detect anything out of the ordinary.
sounds like he kept his nose clean, straightened himself out.
Flack, I've been here before.
it was a crime scene-- a young woman was murdered.
still unsolved.
it's been about ten months.
actually, it was exactly a year ago, detective Bonasera.
I was your primary suspect for a while there.
of course, Morton. I...
anyway... sorry it took me so long to find the keys.
Hey, Morton.
yeah?
when was the last time you saw Damion Brock?
I don't know, a week ago, maybe.
quiet guy.
very low-maintenance tenant.
does that smell like ammonia?
and death.
something definitely happened in this apartment.
did any of your tenants complain of hearing arguments or loud voices?
no.
don't tell me this is happening again.
nobody is gonna want to live in this building if this is happening again.
look, Morton, thank you, but we can take it from here, okay?
do you have any suspects?
do you have any idea who killed Marie?
I stay in touch with her family, and they ask all the time.
I know how much you cared about Marie.
I'm sorry, we don't have anything new right now.
well, let me know if you need anything.
well, this is definitely where he embalmed Damion Brock's body.
what point is this guy trying to make?
I have no idea.
please...
Oh, god!
please!
all right!
all right!
I could see from the stairs that it was a van.
a white van.
T-U... a th-three... a one... P... or B.
I saw that Southern accent-- that's Brock. - I swear to you I don't know!
that's the outgoing message.
there was no tone to transition to the incoming call.
means Brock and the killer were both here when he recorded it.
sounded like he was being tortured.
I think he embalmed Brock while he was still alive.
he knows we're here.
he saw the light go on-- he made the phone call to trigger the answering machine.
he knows where we are.
it's time to find out where he is.
I need a trace on a call made to a Damion Brock.
his home number: 212-555...
so, fill me in.
you know who this guy is? - No.
and there's no apparent connection to Damion Brock.
at this point, they both have the killer in common.
this photo has a little bit of background in it.
does that mean anything to anybody?
take your pick.
no, the answers have to be in that photo.
he wouldn't include a picture with a background in it by accident.
he led us to the first victim; now he's leading us to the second.
so maybe this connects to some other evidence we have in the case.
well, we got piano wire, we got a music box, we got plexiglas, mozart...
music.
it's music.
that's not an "e," it's an "F."
alistair Friedman hall.
it's a music hall-- this guy has a thing about music.
the letters are on the corner of a music stand.
alistair Friedman hall's a big place.
those music stands could be from anywhere-- Julliard, Lincoln center...
all in one direction-- Uptown.
Danny, you're driving.
Stella, see if you can narrow down our target area.
Absolutely.
I just talked to Flack.
911 is connected to a call as we speak.
he said it's coming from the same phone that triggered Damion Drock's answering machine.
can we patch it in here and triangulate?
exactly what I was hoping.
this is the 911 operator.
your call is now connected.
come on, come on.
guys, Alistair Friedman hall is in the 911 call's triangulation search area.
our victim and our killer are together.
we have a location.
all right, this is clear.
nobody's here.
this place is empty.
that's Danny's voice. - Yeah.
911 call's picking him up in the background.
Stella, we need direction.
there's nobody here-- are we in the right place?
you're definitely in the right place.
we can hear you guys on the 911 call.
they can hear us on the cell phone.
it's here someplace.
it's looking like a decoy, Mac.
hold on, Danny.
don't move.
Yeah, I hear that.
call an ambulance.
did you get an I. D. On the killer?
Nakashima died in the emergency room.
the killer cut his tongue out, Stella.
Hey, are you all right?
Nakashima's blood contained an excessive amount of sodium pentothal.
truth serum?
could be the cause of death.
so what did our killer want Lee Nakashima to tell the truth about?
dark hair...
green eyes...
he had some facial hair.
Oh! So this footage was recovered from the cell phone we found with the vic.
killer tossed it in before he sealed it, hoping we'd find them both.
no prints on the phone other than Nakashima's.
paper trail on the purchase of the cell leads to phony names and addresses.
how does Damion Brock connect with Lee Nakashima?
or who did they both piss off?
let's focus on the victims, not the killer.
both these guys had a story to tell about something that hpeapned:
Brock on the answering machine; Nakashima on the cell phone.
something they saw-- and the killer wanted the truth.
but after he got the truth, he killed them.
right, because he got what he wanted, he didn't need them any longer.
Brock remembered a license plate; Nakashima gave a description of a man.
but why remember a license plate?
or describe hair color or eye color or a scar.
because they were witnesses.
witnesses to a crime.
mac, iI f told you to go home and get some rest, you would say...?
what's in the box?
of course you would.
I think I may have found what we're looking for.
lee Nakashima lived in the same building as Damion Brock.
now, lee moved out seven months ago, but they both lived in the building a year ago when marie casimira was murdered.
mac, that's the crime they witnessed.
one of them saw the killer's car and the other his face.
well, if we had that information then, why is the case unsolved?
well, they didn't come forward in the canvass.
Nakashima said he was sleeping; Brock said he wasn't home.
they didn't want to get involved for whatever reason.
and Brock's an ex-con.
Nakashima's here on a visa.
keep silent, don't complicate things.
somebody had to know the truth.
someone knew they witnessed a crime.
maybe Marie Casimira's killer.
maybe he saw them before he ran away from the crime scene.
there's no statute of limitations on murder.
and when you know there's two people out there who can identify you, you might get a little nervous wondering when that day will come.
solving Marie Casimira's case may answer everything.
okay, but what about the other witnesses our killer wants to silence?
two more will die.
Hey, guys.
Sid found this down Lee Nakashima's throat.
concert ticket.
the killer wanted us to find this, like the music box in brock's throat.
she's the next target.
where is she?
she went onstage ten minutes ago.
the world carries on without you but nothing remains the same
I'll be lost without you until the last of days until the last of days.
he wanted her to keep quiet.
she was scared.
what?
that's him.
thank you.
miss Kent, I'm detective Taylor.
we need you to come with us, please - it's okay.
got him? - Got him.
don't move.
I'm sorry I lied about losing the music box.
Marie was a close friend.
I gave it to her the day she died.
she was an amazing classical pianist.
so how did this flower guy end up with it?
I don't know.
why didn't you just go to the police?
I was too scared.
he saw me.
I saw him.
I traded silence for my life.
please don't kill me.
please...
I'll never tell.
I'll never tell.
he let me go.
for whatever reason, he let me live.
I thought it was over, but two months later I realized it would never be over.
he started sending me black calla lilies.
so you kept moving to get away.
but he always found me.
I wanted to tell somebody so bad.
I thought about it every single day.
I was...
I was just too scared.
I didn't want to die.
I am telling you for the 1, 500th time I don't know who these guys are!
I didn't kill them, and I've never been to the Statue of Liberty ever.
Anthony, come on.
you went to the concert tonight to finish the job.
Nakashima, Brock, and Nova could all identify you as the man who killed Marie Casimira.
and you just coustn't live knowing that could happen at any given moment on any day.
no.
I just want to let you know that we have a suspect in custody in Marie's case.
that's good.
I'm glad.
it's been a long year.
well, I'm sorry about what happened, Morton.
it's just that we had to be sure.
I couldn't have killed her, I loved her.
that's a partial license plate.
only you swap the b for a p, the 1 for an L. Tulip3.
that's the flower delivery van you were driving the night you killed Marie Casimira.
Brock saw it, Nakashima gave a description.
Nova saw you, you saw them all.
I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say the jury's probably not gonna buy the twin tulip van defense.
I didn't kill them!
you're being charged with four murders.
if you're lucky enough to escape the death penalty, that's four life sentences.
coming clean could be the difference between living and dying.
have a think on that.
I only saw her.
Nova-- I wanted to make sure she was keeping her mouth shut.
I went there to scare her, not to kill her.
why tonight?
I got a phone call saying she was talking to the police.
I want a lawyer.
Marie's parents will be really glad to know that justice has been served.
I gotta figure out how to say that in italian.
perfect.
what do you think?
we have any physical evidence that puts him in the Statue of Liberty or Damion Brock's apartment?
no, we're still collecting trace, but you believe him?
I believe a year ago he killed Marie Casimira, but the rest doesn't add up.
mac, we just ran Colton's cell records.
there's an incoming call from the same phone that we found on Lee Nakashima.
so unless this guy Colton is playing games, and calling himself...
all right, I think our friend in there is gonna stick with his lies, so I'm gonna go rattle the public defender on call.
this guy didn't kill Nakashima or Brock.
are you telling me that we got the wrong guy?
Flack, why would Colton coerce his victims into confessing deta silof a crime that identifies him as the killer then leave that information at the scene for the police to find?
it doesn't make sense.
wait a minute.
a dead guy can't lock his door.
and the only way to lock a deadbolt's from the outside.
with a key.
you play piano?
I'm taking lessons.
Marie inspired me, actually.
it's her piano.
it's beautiful.
it's from a piano.
it's an A.
don't move.
no, no!
stop!
Morton, step into the light and put your hands up!
I tried to tell everyone there were witnesses, but nobody was listening.
people saw what happened to Marie and they said nothing.
they were cowards.
Morton, I don't want to see either one of us get hurt, all right?
there's other ways to go about this.
routine-- that's how I knew.
I mean, Nakashima, he watches everything, staring out his window.
complaining about every move his neighbors make.
and Brock, Brock sits out on his little ledge smoking every night, and the smell of his tobacco drifts down into my apartment.
I knew he was there.
it is amazing what people will remember when confronted with death.
I made those cowards talk.
it was the only way to get at the truth and to lead you to her killer.
that's when you knew Nova Kent had seen the whole thing.
Brock said that a girl ran away.
that was Nova, right?
she was her friend.
how could she not say something?
how do you see something like that and not say anything?
how do you let an innocent man be accused of a crime he didn't commit?
I did not kill Marie.
what about the Statue of Liberty, Morton?
for Marie.
she deserved something big.
it was easy. I snuck on the island with an electrical crew when they were doing the security reboot and I made my move.
did you see all of the media coverage?
you would still be sitting in your office thumbing through your case file if I hadn't gotten your attention.
can you hear me now?
loud and clear, Morton.
mac, what are you still doing here?
I'm still on London time.
it's breakfast.
you just finish with Morton Brite?
he's at central booking.
the Statue of Liberty was a way to get our attention.
the strangest thing?
even after he knew who killed Marie, never crossed his mind to go after Anthony Colton.
for some, the greatest sin is to turn away and do nothing.
go home.
Yeah.
smallpox, yellow fever, influenza, you had the bubonic plague.
what are you talking about, pops?
long ago, when several coffins were excavated and scratches were found inside...
our ancestors, they realized they'd been burying folks before their time.
no, kid, back then when the plagues hit, guys like you and me, we couldn't dig fast enough.
come on.
saved by the bell?
doesn't mean what you think.
morticians would tie a string to the hand of the dead person and take the other end of the string and tie it to a bell above ground.
and immediately after the burial, a person from the mortuary would be assigned the task to sit by the new gravesite and listen for the bell to ring.
that was called the "graveyard shift.
you're freaking me out, you know that?
my god! What...?
I am gonna kill you!
thanks for coming.
all my guys are on that cessna crash in suffolk.
the report said a little girl was missing?
that's her in the middle.
we have alerts out.
the rest of the family's inside.
no signs of b&e, the place doesn't look tossed.
shaping up like a murder-suicide.
and just so you know, the media's gonna be all over this.
Yeah, multiple homicide.
it's expected.
no, this one's gonna be covered differently.
Why's that?
31 years ago, the former owner, bill willens, shot himself in this house.
two days later, his daughter disappeared.
bill's wife betty claims her husband was hearing voices.
he told people the house was possessed by evil spirits.
just like the amityville horror.
all I know is the folks inside this house were good people.
for gil duncan to shoot his family, commit suicide, there's got to be an explanation other than...
ghosts made him do it.
this is detective monroe.
it's october 31st, 2007, 23: 30 hours.
I'm at 1135 ocean avenue, amityville, new york.
I have two bodies in the hall, both male.
believed to be the sons, tommy and charlie duncan.
both are lying prone in a north-to-south direction.
both appear to have sustained single gunshot wounds to the back.
no apparent stippling, indicating they were shot from medium or long range.
gravitational blood drops indicate both victims were running towards the door when they were shot.
third victim, female, believed to be amy duncan, age 35.
also received single gunshot wound to the back.
no apparent stippling.
final victim, believed to be gil duncan, age 38, shotgun six inches east of his left hand.
single gunshot wound to the abdomen.
circular bruise pattern can be seen around the wound, bulge on one end, consistent with the weapons foresight, indicates a close contact shot, also consistent with suicide.
all right, I'm out of step plates.
I'm gonna go grab some more, all right?
what's up?
what's the matter?
what? - Shh, listen.
please, help me...
there's someone inside the wall.
stay back from the wall!
help me!
I'm gonna get ya.
it's rose from the photo.
all right, hang on, sweetie.
okay, hang on sweetheart, I got you.
she's been shot.
get her to a hospital now!
excuse me.
happy holloweird, mac.
looks like quite a massacre.
zombie flash mob?
Yeah, I don't get it either.
so stella told me your mysterious caller disappeared.
I haven't got a call at 3: 33 A. M. In over a week.
maybe your guy decided it was time to stop stalking you.
maybe he's getting ready to take it the next level.
Hey, meet john doe.
wallet's missing and no one's stepping forward to say they recognize him.
witnesses say they saw him hit the deck, but they thought he was just overacting.
got the torn clothes, dirt, blood blunt-force trauma to the head.
nothing fake about that.
medium-velocity spatter indicates he could have been hit here.
blood trail?
I don't know.
we've tested 30 stains, so far-- all fake.
so we don't know if we're looking at a primary or a secondary crime scene.
all we had is our vic and 300 zombies crammed into midtown vandalizing stores, stalling traffic and scaring tourists.
all for a laugh.
maybe someone didn't get the joke.
trick or treat!
Hey-hey!
mom?
yes?
I don't feel so good.
someone ate too much candy.
come on. Let's go home.
Danny is that you?
get out!
get out!
I told them to leave!
I warned them, but you still have a chance!
leave this house.
leave now or it will get you!
whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you doing?
you didn't see her?
see who?
I got my men doing a canvas of the neighborhood, grid search of the yard.
but so far, no evidence of any elderly female intruder.
do you not believe me?
all I'm saying is people come to town and get caught up in the folklore.
do we look like we're here buying postcards?
sheriff, we've all got a lot of work to do -
if you and your men would just secure the perimeter, that'd be greatly appreciated.
right.
thank you.
forget about this guy.
you saw the old woman who grabbed you.
she went down that secret corridor?
right. Like she already knew where it was.
Danny, she said that she warned the duncans to stay out of the house.
that something was going to happen.
she knows something.
we should find her.
well, she couldn't have gotten too far on foot.
we'll find her soon enough.
Hey, you know what? She scratched my arm.
if she left her dna behind, we might not have to wait that long.
quite the ambience, sid.
Halloween is the one day of the year we're allowed -
encouraged to celebrate the dead.
for without death, one cannot appreciate life.
what about this one?
cod is subdural hematoma.
wound like this often isn't immediately fatal.
your vic could have been somewhat lucid, and even walking or stumbling for about 15 minutes post impact.
okay, so if he was transient after he was hit, it means that midtown isn't our primary crime scene.
any idea on the murder weapon?
that's tricky, mac.
your vic suffered blunt force trauma as well as sharp force trauma.
the sharp force trauma wounds are approximately a half inch wide and extend into the bone.
looks like chopping wounds.
may be looking for an axe or a machete.
even more interesting, is the blunt force trauma.
it was localized in the parietal region of the skull.
looks like a "w" or an "M.
murder weapon had raised lettering on it.
he could have been hit with two different weapons.
anything else?
found wood-like fibers under his nails.
already sent them up to trace.
finally, for what I can't explain:
body temp indicates your vic has been dead for eight hours, even though witness reports established he's been dead for three.
means he died twice.
that's not possible.
well, I didn't find any bite marks on him or human brains in his stomach contents.
but he was dead before he was killed.
which medically makes him a zombie.
happy halloween.
heaven's so far away heaven's so far away cherry, cherry, cherry cherry, cherry, cherry cherry, cherry, cherry, baby heaven's so far away cherry on the lips heaven's so far away now tell me baby who's your daddy?
marks on our vic's head weren't made by two different weapons -
they were made by one cricket bat.
any luck, with narrowing down primary crime scenes?
Yeah, I have a radius of origin.
and considering his injuries, our vic could have kept walking for up to half a mile before collapsing.
I'll get flack working on a canvas.
if we can find where our vic was coming from, maybe we can find our killer.
I don't get it. Who puts a secret passageway in their own house?
probably from the prohibition era.
a lot of these homes out here had them back then.
guessing rose discovered the room when the family moved in.
when she saw her father go on a rampage, she went in there to hide.
and that's when the shot went through the wall and hit her.
you know, the only question I have is, if gil wanted to kill his whole family, why not go after rose?
there's no bloody footprints.
there's no indication that he went looking for her.
I mean, unless he knew she was behind the wall and he shot her deliberately.
maybe gil's not our shooter.
this pad's giving me a weak positive.
there's only trace amounts of gunshot residue.
if he handled this gun, he'd have gsr all over him.
but what about the circular bruise pattern on the wound?
that's consistent with a close contact shot.
I'm thinking the shot cup could have made this mark.
well, that means our contact shot isn't a contact shot at all.
which means gil might not have shot himself.
we've got to get this to hawkes for testing.
Danny, gil duncan didn't kill himself.
distance determination showed the muzzle of the barrel was about four feet away when gil was shot.
so there's no way he could have reached the trigger.
so we're not looking at a murder-suicide.
we're looking for a killer.
trajectory of the shot suggest that our shooter was standing right around here when he pulled the trigger.
which means our killer left this footprint.
it's the hospital.
Hi, rose.
I'm detective monroe, and this is detective messer.
we're trying to find out who hurt your family.
the monster.
you saw a monster in your house?
those belong to our zombie?
Yeah. Clothes we got from the vic.
nothing unusual, though.
he was covered in dirt.
gravitational blood drops on the shoe confirm the victim was up and walking when he was hit.
but found this a little strange.
a diaper?
our vic was wearing it.
tested positive for urine.
seemed a little young for incontinence issues.
could have been his costume, or he could have been drinking and just knew how hard it was to find a bathroom in midtown manhattan on any day, let alone halloween.
tox came back totally clean.
our vic wasn't drinking.
and the wood-like substance that sid found under his fingernails turned out to be jute coated with traces of a water-based varnish.
Jute's usually used in rope and rugs.
where did the varnish come from?
a coffin.
Flack did a little digging.
he found out that two cemetery groundskeepers reported a zombie attack last night.
half of manhattan reported zombie attacks last night.
Yeah, but this one was different.
diggers reported they were filling a grave when a man broke through a coffin -
but not just any coffin, it was biodegradable, made from jute.
very easy to get out of.
did you get an I. D. From the funeral home?
Yeah.
the vic's name is dexter nevins.
35 years old, married to a sophia nevins.
we're trying to find her now.
Dexter was an immigration attorney.
his funeral was yesterday afternoon.
small ceremony.
he's not saying what I think he's saying, is he?
we may have discovered where our vic first rose from the dead.
think our vic could have squeezed through that hole?
if he was desperate enough.
those are definitely scratch marks.
how did dexter nevins get buried alive?
Flack's pulling the death certificate to see who pronounced him dead.
that's a voodoo doll, mac.
maybe this will tell us who wanted him dead.
so what do we have that'll put us on the trail of our doll maker?
found a photo of our vic torn up in the doll's head.
morley cigarettes, bottle of haitian rum and three extremely rare haitian blue coffee beans.
according to an internet search, all these items right here are traditional offerings to baron samedi, voodoo god of the dead.
even creepier, the hair on the doll's head was a match to dexter nevins.
this wasn't some toy.
this was made specifically for dexter.
only voodoo didn't kill him, a blow to the head did.
except there's no reason to make a voodoo doll other than to wish harm on someone.
speaks to prior motive.
true.
Yeah, but wouldn't we expect, though, to find the doll with the killer and not the victim?
unless our killer decided to bury the evidence. With the body.
the only flaw to that perfect plan -
when your vic decides to come back to life.
I hate zombies.
I know.
they spoil all the fun, don't they?
so whoever made this doll may have used dexter nevins as the ultimate sacrifice.
went through a reference catalog of shotgun wounds and the spread pattern on gil was consistent with dr. Hawkes' findings;
four feet seems about right.
also found numerous hairs while removing the victims' clothing.
they didn't look human, so I sent them up to kendall and she said they came back to multiple dog breeds, one being a tibetan kyiapso.
it's supposed to be extremely rare.
there's nothing here in the house that indicates the family had a dog, sid.
then maybe your killer did.
maybe, yeah.
Hey, linds, I took a look at those shoeprints you sent back to the lab.
they're work boots, size 11.
gill duncan wore size nine.
what about the shotgun?
no prints.
looks like it was wiped down.
did find trace on the trigger guard, though.
chromatographic fingerprint revealed it's sap from pinus strobus, also known as the eastern white pine tree.
it's indigenous to...
wait a minute.
did you say white pine?
Yeah, that's right.
Sheldon, I'll call you back.
Hawkes said he found sap from the eastern white pine on the murder weapon.
this is a white pine.
Yeah, check it out.
those branches are broken.
our killer could have climbed this tree...
onto the second story, made his way over to that roof and into the attic.
there's a footprint with sap and bark on the roof.
more sap on the frame.
that confirms point of entry.
there's a shirt.
it's about the only thing not covered in dust.
I got something.
it looks like I got absorbents right here.
small tears, sap.
this belonged to our shooter.
that's a latent blood stain underneath the dust, which means somebody tried to cover this up a while ago.
let me see that.
there's sweat all over this shirt.
Yeah, well, it's like a sauna up here.
the amount of sweat; I think our shooter was up here for a while.
but the question is what was he waiting for?
excuse me.
we're looking for...
thank you.
the man is cursed.
excuse me?
the tower card...
the hanged man...
and the devil.
be careful!
I have strangers here, I see.
your names?
mac taylor, stella bonasera, nypd.
how can I help you, detectives?
miss delacroix, did you make this doll?
it might be one of mine.
well, we found haitian blue ce offebeans inside of this doll and yours is the only store in the city that sells them.
we believe the doll was specifically made for one man.
this man here. He was murdered last night.
we need to know who you made the doll for.
what are you doing?
I'm not doing anything.
close your eyes.
what?
I said close your eyes.
I'm not gonna ask you again.
who are you?
Josephine delacroix, I just told you.
how do you know me?
I don'T.
you just walked into my store.
in the past two months,
I've been getting anonymous phone calls, all at 3: 33 in the morning.
some people believe 333 to be a proverb:
the curse of the lord is in the house of the wicked, but he blesses the habitation of the just.
what do you believe it to mean?
333 is the son of the devil, 666, the one who collects souls for the sins of our youth.
okay, we're leaving, but we'll be back.
wait.
this is all my fault.
I did not make that doll for anyone.
I made it for myself.
Mr. Nevins was a client.
his death is my doing.
you killed him?
I put a curse on him.
Why?
Mr. Nevins wanted to know about haitian voodoo.
more specifically, about returning back from the dead.
he said he wanted to know the scam.
I told him there was no scam.
it was voodoo.
so how did the doll get in dexter's coffin?
I put the doll in at the funeral.
the only place for it to be was with mr. Nevins as he greeted baron samedi, god of the dead face-to-face.
it's starting to sound like dexter buried himself alive.
wanted to fake his own death.
you think it was a life insurance scam?
probably.
explains the diaper.
but why plan for a bathroom break and not the fact that you're gonna run out of oxygen 40 minutes after being buried?
and then why have an open-casket funeral when you're trying to fake your own death?
witnesses, in case the insurance company balked.
so how did he fool all those people into believing he was dead?
get anything from the dna off of your arm?
no hits in codus, but when I ran the old woman's dna against the blood that we found in the attic floor,
I found shared alleles at all 16 loci.
so the blood in the attic was from the daughter?
or mother.
and the nmr analysis dated the blood back to 30 years ago.
which is when the willens family lived in that house.
Yeah.
so what does the old lady and the blood in the attic have to do with the duncan family murders?
we need to find out what happened in that house 31 years ago.
Danny, this is the former owner of the house.
okay, this is gonna sound really weird, but I think that's the woman who attacked me.
what would she be doing in her old house?
I don't know, but I'm gonna age this, see if I'm right.
that's her! - I don't get it.
what would make betty willens return to that house after 30 years?
I might be able to answer that.
what do you got?
rose's monster.
DNA from the sweaty shirt you found in the attic came back as betty willens' son henry.
his dna was in the system, and take a look at this tattoo.
rose wasn't imagining it.
she did see a monster.
this guy's been in and out of prison his entire life.
currently on parole after serving a nickel for armed robbery.
his P. O. Got him a job as an animal control officer for the county.
that could explain the dog hair we found on the vic's clothing.
let's bring this guy in.
not so fast. Got to find him first.
reached out to his boss -
turns out henry's been mia with his truck since yesterday.
his last dispatch reported he picked up several dogs and never made it to the pound.
called him at his house, he doesn't answer his phone.
same with his mother, betty.
got an alarm out on both of them.
maybe his truck has one of those anti-theft tracking...
no, no, no, come on, already asked.
you know what, the dogs might.
what?
Sid said that the hairs he found came back to a very expensive breed of dog.
so I'm thinking if I were that pet's owner,
I'd do everything in my power to make sure it never got lost.
you can't lojack a dog though-- wait, can you?
no, but they do make dog collars with gps tracking chips in them.
so you said that that dogs henry picked up never made it back to the pound?
right.
I'm thinking maybe they're still with him.
and if one of those dogs has a gps collar...
then maybe we can track henry down.
Dexter nevins' death certificate.
cod was congestive heart failure and was signed by a dr. Roger burgess.
I think I know how dexter fooled him.
I figured it had to be some type of drug that our routine tox didn't catch or that had already metabolized out of his system.
so I went to our most recent sample.
the diaper.
exactly.
I found tetrodotoxin in dexter's urine.
that would explain why the body temperature didn't reflect time of death.
Dexter would have seemed dead. - Right.
the only question is:
how does an immigration attorney get his hands on a drug like that?
unless he has a friend who's a doctor.
who'd be willing to sign his death certificate, no questions asked.
Dr. Burgess.
Hey, guys.
so I'm loving your insurance scam theory.
Dexter nevins was insured to the hilt.
his wife sophia was the beneficiary and it turns out he and sophia were in major debt.
so dexter's dead and there's a lot of money to be collected.
Where's the wife?
no one can find her.
she hasn't collected the insurance either.
it's like she disappeared.
if dr. Burgess was in on it, they could be together.
took a look at sophia's last credit transactions.
everything stops the day before the funeral, and get this -
the last charge on their joint card -
a helios personal oxygen system.
with oxygen, dexter could have survived ten, 12 hours.
Sophia comes back, digs him up and they split town with the money.
there was no evidence of an oxygen tank in the coffin.
maybe it was never put in the coffin because sophia never intended to dig her husband up.
take a look at this.
this is a real-time map of all the animals that are reported lost and being tracked by ani-trac, the gps collar company.
I got 20 hits in manhattan and western long island.
everything's in motion except for these four.
all right, where is this?
1135 ocean avenue.
that's the duncan's address.
this guy's going back to the crime scene.
that's henry.
don't move.
don't move.
toss the lady. I got him.
what's in the suitcase?
don't.
don't open it.
please!
please don't open it!
don't!
my baby.
my baby.
ma'am, I beg you -
don't let them take my babies.
please, please, please, don't let them.
please.
I beg you, don't let them take them, please.
when you're a little kid, you don't know nothing, you know?
my crazy dad shoots himself in the head, all my mom tells me is, he went to live with the angels.
that's dumb, right?
that's dumb.
my father loved guns.
I loved my father.
when he was gone, I just...
I wanted to keep remembering him, you know.
it just went off.
Henry was never right after that night.
and it was my fault.
I knew I had to protect him.
I knew that they'd take him away or they'd declare me unfit.
I'd already lost my husband.
I couldn't bear losing all that was left of my family.
so you cleaned up the crime scene and you buried your daughter in the house.
only you told everybody that she just disappeared.
and for 31 years, people believed you.
I should... I should have moved her years ago.
I was evicted.
I just didn't think anyone would... - why now?
I read the story in the paper about the old place being sold.
no one had lived there since henry and I left.
everyone thought it was haunted.
except the duncans.
they told reporters they didn't believe in ghosts.
they said that they were looking forward to renovating the old place.
which meant they'd uncover your secret.
so you sent henry to go get your daughter before she could be discovered.
it was all supposed to be so simple.
and those people weren't supposed to be there.
I mean, it was halloween, you know.
I waited till they left.
but they came home early, because little charlie had a stomachache.
and when they found you inside their house you killed them all.
I panicked.
I couldn't go back to jail.
who are you?
what are you doing here?
honey, call the police.
don't do that.
Hey, man, no, no, no.
then when it's all over, you put the gun in gil's hand.
thought people might assume the house was still possessed.
no.
it was you, henry, who killed that family.
it was not the devil.
you're wrong.
the devil did kill that family that night.
he came to me the day my sister died in that house.
I just didn't know enough not to let him in.
Hey, mac.
I'm trying to reach dr. Burgess who signed our vic's death certificate.
his office says he hasn't shown up for work today.
you try him at home?
no answer, but look at this address. - 40th and park.
it's less than ten blocks from where we found our vic.
it's also on the perimeter we set for the point of origin.
I'm thinking his home might be our primary crime scene.
Dr. Burgess?
NYPD. We want to have a couple words with you.
Hey, mac.
I've got dirt and blood.
I've got a faint pulse.
they're still alive.
get me a bus at 1530 west 40th street and put a rush on it.
bet I know what this is.
tetrodotoxin.
just like dexter.
makes sense now.
once dexter escaped from the coffin, he knew they left him for dead.
he wanted some answers.
looks like dexter got his answers...
and his revenge.
you think they'll survive?
depending on what the dosage was.
but for now, they're caught between the living and the dead.
Taxi!
come on. It's beautiful out.
it's freezing.
I want to walk.
Fiona CHISHOLM&THE DOROTHEA HOTEL PRESENT A WINTER WONDERLAND
Oh, it's beautiful!
look!
it's snowing!
it's snowing.
halie, it's freezing outside.
we gotta go!
gotcha!
now you're going to get it.
run!
owner of the Dorothea Hotel.
Yep. The wicked witch of the upper East side.
her reputation precedes her.
that's quite a snow scene for the driest winter on record.
it's Fiona's tax-deductible gift to the city.
she does it every year.
who found her?
couple over there was doing the mistletoe dance.
said the platform just gave way.
swear they didn't know she was there.
signs of early-onset rigor.
T. O.D?
maybe six hours, give or take.
lovebirds called in the platform collapse about two hours ago.
so she was dead before the castle crushed her.
looks like a puncture wound here.
penetration looks deep; could be a stab wound.
if she was stabbed, it seems odd there isn't more blood.
Yeah.
I can't believe it.
they applauding?
they're applauding.
I guess the question isn't who would want to kill Fiona Chisolm but who wouldn't？
the killer caught a break with these snow machines.
the hotel keeps them on 24-7.
they ruin any chance of finding a discernible footprint.
chain on this looks like it was cut.
maybe from a purse?
could be.
is that a print?
looks like it.
maybe from our killer?
l-shaped drip pattern to the chest wound.
blood drip starts one direction, then changes course.
this is a dump job.
so not only do we need to find who murdered her, we need to find out where.
bus driver said he got distracted when a couple of kids were fighting.
knock it off, you two!
cab stopped short in front of him.
driver says she came out of nowhere.
it's the middle of winter.
what's she doing outside in her nightgown, with no shoes on?
running from someone, something?
the body's nearly frozen.
any witnesses?
no one saw her before the accident.
it's as if she suddenly appeared out of nowhere.
where did she come from?
you got something?
the answer to your question.
she slid off the bus.
where did she fall from?
could be her name.
I'll run it and a description through missing persons.
last name would have been nice.
crushed flowers?
during the black plague, perfumed flowers were stuffed into the pockets of those who perished...
to mask the smell of death.
so that would make this...
a pocket full of posies. Ashes, ashes...
we all fall down.
I checked with the bus company.
as far as they know, this bus was parked in the lot all weekend.
there are no buildings adjacent to the property, so she didn't fall there.
there's a space between the roof and the inside ceiling.
that's why there's no dent on the inside.
these things are like tin cans.
there's no soundproofing or insulation.
Yeah, well, then, why didn't the bus driver hear her land?
Danny, I... I heard about the Sandoval shooting.
kid lived in your building.
his name was Ruben.
kid was only ten years old.
I'm sorry.
that look familiar to you?
Yeah, it's the same one our vic was wearing.
wait. She was on top of the bus and inside?
who might just be the proud owner of this baseball cap.
I'm thinking that's blood.
it's too big, though, to belong to a kid or our vic.
well, then, whose hat is it?
your scene assessment was correct.
the crush injuries didn't exhibit bleeding.
she was dead before the house-- castle-- fell on her.
any defense wounds?
bruise here on the wrist.
most likely caused by someone tugging on the purse strap we found.
could be looking at a robbery.
that thief went to a lot of trouble to steal a purse.
Fiona wasn't only crushed, but stabbed and burned as well.
contact burn.
any idea what stabbed her?
wound morphology was compromised by the crush injuries.
so the official cause of death was stabbing or burning?
neither.
her skin shows little evidence of freezing, which is in stark contrast to the condition of her internal organs, namely her heart.
I'm assuming the stab injury must be related, and I'm not sure how it happened, but C. O.D. is acute cardiac failure due to freeze trauma.
Fiona Chisolm died from a frozen heart.
the partial print we found on fiona's collarbone.
it wasn't a fingerprint.
it was a nose print.
a dog nose print.
the DNA came back canine.
specifically, a norwich terrier.
so I called the Dorothea Hotel, and Fiona owned a terrier named otto.
maybe it got spooked, and ran off.
or was snatched.
despite the lizard skin and platinum chain,
I don't think this is a handle from a purse.
found traces of the pesticide imidacloprid, commonly used as a flea repellent for pets.
I'm thinking this handle is from a leash.
dognapping?
could be.
chain looks cut.
odd thing is, there are no tool marks.
trying to figure out what could have snapped a platinum chain clean in half.
that dog could have traces of our killer on him.
okay. I'll call all the animal shelters, see if anybody picked him up.
right. In the meantime, if Fiona was walking her dog when she was killed, we need to find out where that walk started.
Yep.
chestnuts! Hot chestnuts!
we got hot chestnuts. Get 'em while they're hot.
one bag, please. - There ya go.
Yes, well, somehow, as concierge, walking otto became a duty of mine.
but not last night?
I went to go and get the dog from Fiona, but she was behind closed doors screaming at some guy.
she ended up dead, and you didn't think a heated argument was worth reporting?
heated arguments were as much a part of Fiona's day as breathing.
I knocked, she screamed at me to go away, so I left.
well, where were you for the rest of the night?
I left work at 6: 00, then I went to the double crow pub on 37th.
I'm there every night.
guess tonight I'll be knocking back a few for poor old Fiona.
you don't seem very broken up over her death.
the rumors about how mean she is-- they're all true.
anyone could have killed her except for me.
Where's Fiona's office?
wicked.
bristles are positive for blood.
broken broom, knocked over pictures, smashed lamp, it all points to a struggle.
so who is the guy Fiona was screaming at behind closed doors?
not keeping you busy enough, Sid?
uh, actually, your Wendy inspired a little research.
any of it lead to C. O.D?
Yes, well, this one's a real cliffhanger.
okay, when my tech tested your vic's body temperature at the scene, it was 70 degrees.
adjusting for the extreme weather conditions,
I'm estimating she was killed eight to nine hours before you found her.
which makes time of death just after midnight.
and while her broken bones are consistent with the damage caused by the impact of the bus and taxi, her was caused by exsanguination, due to the transecting of the right inferior mesenteric artery.
bled out through the abdomen.
but it was the manner by which the wounds were inflicted that baited my interest.
both wound tracks revealed curvature.
she was killed with a hook?
or a hook-like instrument.
from the semen I found, she had sex shortly before she died.
nothing to indicate it was anything but consensual.
what's that?
a fairy.
it's from a small red impression I found behind her right shoulder.
any idea what caused it?
no idea, but which brings me to my research.
a fairy, Wendy in a nightgown, killed by a sharp curved instrument.
makes one wonder if you shouldn't be looking for captain hook.
J-M-BARRIE'S PETER PAN any luck identifying the vic?
angell checked with missing persons.
nothing that matches our jane doe, including the name "Wendy" or anything else.
based on the vic's weight and depth of impact, it appears she fell 35 feet.
it's about a three-story drop, so our primary crime scene would be a building that's 35 feet or higher.
leaves about every structure in manhattan.
Adam's processing the rest of the evidence.
maybe he found something that can help us narrow down the search.
the name written on the vic's chest, "wendy" was written in a water-based acrylic.
finger paint?
and the clay that Sid found under her fingernails had a mixture of wheat flour, deodorized kerosene, salt, borax and alum -
otherwise known as "kiddie clay."
mm, starting to see a theme here.
and the star that was stuck to her forehead had a partial.
it was a match to a print that Sid found in the finger paint.
it didn't match the vic and there was no hits in afis.
so we got finger paints, kiddie clay and a gold star, items that might be found in a kindergarten class or a toy store.
our vic was murdered and dumped from 35 feet.
there's not a lot of kindergartens or toy stores with three stories in a 20-mile radius of where our vic was found.
toy stores and schools are the last places I want to be looking for a killer right now.
based on the arts-and-crafts trace you found on the vic, I did some checking.
been a rash of kindergarten break-ins.
this one just last night.
we're on the third floor.
with a parking lot below.
big enough to park a bus.
so our perp lifts a school bus from where they park the buses and then returns it with a dead body on the roof?
looks like we got our evidence right here.
school security didn't think it was a big deal.
a few tables and chairs were knocked over, nothing was stolen.
who breaks into a kindergarten classroom?
same M. O. at the other schools.
perp left the place a mess.
nothing was missing.
he's been doing that a lot lately.
I didn't know mars had sunspots.
if I remember correctly, sunspots don't have directionality -
is it blood?
Yeah.
could be cast-off.
killer did a good job cleaning up, if that's all he missed.
let's find out.
based on the amount of blood, I'd say we were in the right place.
got gravitational blood drops over here.
got a hidden book over here.
Peter PAN & WENDY
it's got some handwritten numbers in the back and it's not from this classroom.
it's come from the public library.
think we found our murder weapon.
this make sense to anybody?
the way I remember it, peter pan was about a fantasy, not about a murder.
Hey, Stella...
yeah?
what do Pakistan and Nigeria and Afghanistan have in common?
Oh do I really want to know?
polio and meningitis, for which you get vaccinated when you travel to those countries.
now, I got the results back from the blood on the broom.
male, human, no hits in CODIS, but there were antibodies in the blood, and the high level suggests the donor was inoculated with a vaccine sometime in the past two weeks.
male blood. - Right.
now, I had flack cross-reference a list of people who've been immunized in the past two weeks with Fiona's known associates.
we found a connection.
Harrison Green, MD.
he's the founder of heartsage international.
it's a children's charity, and up till now, Fiona's been their biggest donor, but guess what. This year, she didn't make a donation.
maybe Dr. Green tried to change her mind.
I had a meeting with fiona, but I didn't attack her.
we were friends, good friends.
my friends don't play broomball with my face.
I play rugby.
it's a tough sport.
Dr. Green, we can match every bristle to every scratch, not to mention the blood.
the woman was insane.
if she wasn't one of my biggest donors, I'd have nothing to do with her.
well, she wasn't one of your biggest donors this year.
that why you went to her office?
I wanted the money she promised me; us, the children of nigeria.
Fiona, don't cut us off! - Let go of me!
don't cut us off! - Let go of me...
do you always resort to physical altercations when soliciting donations?
when it's something I'm passionate about, sure.
I have a heart.
isn't that what charity's all about?
not when your charity's flagged by the IRS.
seems that a percentage of the funds that you're collecting to immunize children is actually going towards the construction of your lake como home.
Yeah, I'm guessing that all your trips to Nigeria were strictly for photo ops, prove you're legit.
Fiona suspected that you were a fraud and stopped writing you checks.
I have other investors.
none as powerful as fiona chisholm.
all she had to do was pick up the phone, call the papers and you'd be finished.
unless you have the evidence, to arrest me, I think you're finished.
any luck finding the dog?
not yet.
but his broken leash is another story.
since I couldn't figure out what could've cut the leash without leaving tool marks,
I decided to take a closer look.
I found...a repetitive pattern with a break along a single plane, which means the metal was extremely brittle.
like it was frozen.
Yeah.
it's definitely a match.
liquid nitrogen snapped the leash.
and I'm thinking it's also what caused Fiona's heart to freeze.
you know, the shape and diameter of the stab wound...
could be consistent... with the nozzle of a liquid nitrogen tank.
allowing direct access to her heart.
now, a tank nozzle is very blunt, so the killer must've used tremendous force to push it all the way through F isiona's cardiac wall.
there are liquid nitrogen tanks on street corners all over the city.
the utility companies use them to maintain power lines and reduce corrosion.
you know what else liquid nitrogen is used for?
snow machines.
LNI, pressurized air and water-- instant winter fun.
landscape supply company responsible for the snow said this is where they store all the tanks they use during the week.
Hey, this nozzle's bent.
positive for blood.
looks like we found our murder weapon.
there's something stuck to this valve.
looks like skin from a finger.
who touches a liquid nitrogen tank without gloves?
maybe the force of Fiona's body hitting the tank caused it to fall.
the jarring would have allowed a few blasts, more than enough to kill her.
and if the nozzle was on the ground, the ln2 could've easily reached the leash.
so the killer got fiona.
and her little dog, too.
Hey, boss.
I got some information on the baseball cap you guys found on the school bus.
hmm, blood on the bill matched our jane doe.
the DNA from the band had shared male alleles at 12 out of 16 loci with the vic's reference sample.
so it's our Jane Doe's brother and he's not in our system.
what about the hat's logo?
it belongs to Stanwell and Linford.
it's a brokerage firm on wall street.
gentlemen, get this straight.
right now I have 20 interns and only one of you is getting a job.
so if you want to get my attention, you're gonna have to give more than 110 percent.
first order of business is getting your asses down to the tenth floor for drug testing.
nurse ratchet is waiting.
now move.
Mr. Wright, nypd crime lab.
we'd like to talk to you.
it's about your sister.
your receptionist recognized her.
her name's Leslie.
you know where leslie was last night?
we had dinner.
left the restaurant around 10: 00.
Leslie said she was going to a party.
I hailed her a taxi.
that was the last time I saw her.
whose party was it?
I should've asked.
I have no idea.
did your sister have a boyfriend?
if she did, I would've been the last to know.
I guess that's what you get for being an overprotective big brother.
Mr. Wright...
we found a baseball cap we believe belongs to you, bears your company's logo and was found inside the same school bus where your sister's body was found.
was Leslie wearing it last night?
not when we were together.
you have to find out who did this.
please tell me you'll get the person who did this.
Oh, Hey.
that was a nice move.
what is this, dancing with the scientists?
no, it's more like a wu-tang with a little heel-toe action.
Oh, yeah. Moving right along.
I used the structural data from the ri along with the molecular weight
I pulled from the gcms to I. D.
the pill you found in the classroom.
it's methoxy diisopropyltryptamine, also known as "foxy."
an intense high with an abrupt comedown.
the latest in high-end designer drugs.
makes ecstasy look like aspirin.
and users claim it induces this childlike wonder.
LSD with a twist.
and... the tox results confirm that our vic had foxy in her system.
so your Wendy was flying high at T. O.D.
question is, who was her copilot?
Hey, mac, I pulled a bunch of prints off the peter pan book, but nothing hit in AFIS and there's nothing that puts the brother at the scene.
but here's that page of numbers I found in the back of the book.
now, they're all five digits.
the first two are sequential.
Yeah, they're text numbers, so, when you send a text, a few seconds later, this is what comes back to you.
Alice will see you at 11: 30 tonight at dunhill.
dunhill is one of those pricey private kindergarten schools on the upper east side.
but who the hell is Alice?
so who touches a liquid nitrogen tank without gloves?
Hey, I got prints from the skin that was on the liquid nitrogen tank.
no hits in AFIS, so I cast a wider net.
found something in homeland security.
Hey, our good friend Tina O'donovan, the concierge.
she entered this country from Ireland on a work visa three years ago.
sponsored by?
the Dorothea Hotel.
but here's the best part.
she was fired two days ago.
wait, so if Tina was fired before Fiona was killed, what made her show up for work this morning?
when I found out fiona was gone and no one else knew that she'd fired me...
you figured you'd keep working.
it made sense to me.
look, I told you I was at the double crow pub all night.
so you want to explain why your DNA is on the murder weapon?
we found a piece of your finger on the nitrogen tank.
because she told me to fix it.
Tina... the snowman is melting.
it's melting.
what am I supposed to do?
it's my pleasure, Ms. Chisolm.
look, I've got a brain.
I'm not stupid.
I knew surviving Fiona meant I could write my own ticket in this town.
why would I tear that in half?
ashes, ashes, we all fall down!
ring around the rosy...
looks like we're in the right place.
ashes, ashes we all fall down. This party is invitation only.
left mine at home.
Where'd you get that bruise?
Oh, this.
few nights ago.
mad party.
mad.
apparently, the party's going on 24/7 in your head.
I... I can't explain myself, I'm afraid, sir, because I'm not myself.
you see?
Yeah, well...
whoever you are...
you have the right to remain silent.
let's go.
sorry to kill your trip, but why a kindergarten?
it's wildgarten, man.
that's just another name for getting high with your friends.
look, it's all kept under the radar.
invites are small.
we each get a book with text numbers, tell us when and where we're supposed to be.
the party begins.
the foxy, man...
makes the game real.
turns Manhattan into Neverland.
except nobody dies in Neverland.
this is the weapon that was used to kill Leslie Wright.
and the bruise on your hand is consistent with the shape of this weapon and the amount of force that would've been needed to kill her.
wait a minute, I didn't kill her.
see, I got evidence that says otherwise.
I barely knew this girl.
Bryce, I got you for breaking and entering.
and according to all your friends here, you were the one that stole that bus.
I had a summer job cleaning school buses.
I kept some of the keys.
I only borrowed them for a few hours.
still doesn't explain that bruise.
look, we were just messing around.
I was pretending with my buddy Elliot.
I don't know what happened to the hook after I dropped it.
somebody stuck it into Leslie Wright's stomach a couple times.
it wasn't me.
let me explain this to you in a way you might understand.
forget neverland-- you got to grow up and that's going to be behind bars serving a life sentence for murder.
this is otto?
Yes.
Hi, otto.
how you doing?
Fiona couldn't be too bad; her dog is friendly.
Where'd you find him?
salesman at a bike shop found him in a basket.
he was going to take him home to red hook, till he saw the news, called the precinct.
he didn't give him a bath, did he? - Nope.
for the past 24 hours, this pampered pooch has been slumming it.
all right, otto...
Hey, guys. What do we got?
DNA from the blood on otto's mouth came back human.
no I. D.. But it's male.
now, the dog was gone for almost 24 hours.
it means the blood could belong to anyone.
what about the collar?
trace came back as searic, palmitic and linoleic acid.
it's commonly found in chestnuts.
roasted to be exact.
there were also traces of charcoal.
and the burn pattern on fiona's neck could be consistent with the grill on a chestnut cart.
so that's how fiona was transferred from the primary crime scene to the front of the hotel.
I had flack pull all vendor licenses.
there's only one in the area with a permit to sell near the Dorothea.
name's Felix Hall.
two weeks ago, he filed an appeal.
seems someone was trying to pull his license and kick him to another corner.
let me guess: Fiona.
Yeah, but those are rotten, man.
just pull the top away. That'll be fine.
Yeah, it's still good.
this is just wrong.
seriously, no new yorker should ever see this. Ever.
look, you can always put in for psych leave.
Hey, Felix Hall?
NYPD.
we got a couple questions to ask you, nut man.
starting with: Which cart is yours?
Why? What's going on?
Hey, hey, wait, what do you think you're doing?
I just cleaned this thing.
positive for blood and this looks like skin.
looks like you've been roasting more than chestnuts in this thing, Felix.
put your hands behind your back.
Felix Hall, you're under arrest for the murder of Fiona Chisolm.
you okay?
no, I'm not.
I don't think I'm ever going to be the same.
I know what it's like, man.
you have your corner -
five feet by five feet, but it might as well be a kingdom, right?
prime spot.
but then Fiona decides to take it all away.
what was it? She didn't like the way your awning looked, or maybe she just didn't like the smell of chestnuts in the morning.
we got your DNA off the dog, Felix.
did he bite you before or after you killed Fiona?
the only thing I'm guilty of is having the courage to stand up to her.
Msolchis. M, please...I need this corner.
there are hundreds of corners in this city.
feel free to set up on any one of them but mine...
Mrs. Chisolm, wait...
she pushed you too far.
so you decided to push back.
Hey!
you did it, Felix.
and you used your cart to move the body.
and you figured between her employees and all the people in the street, there's be too many suspects to count, right?
the blood we found inside your cart and the skin from the burner, it was positive for Fiona's DNA.
all that woman cared about was herself.
she didn't know what it was like for real people.
so you decided she needed somebody to put her in her place.
teaching someone a lesson only works if they're still alive to learn it.
the DNA I got off the hook wasn't a match to Bryce Aldicott.
but when I compared it to other case samples, it was a match to another donor on the hat.
which puts that hat on someone besides the brother.
maybe it was someone else at the brokerage firm.
except we can't just go around asking for DNA samples.
we don't have to.
the first order of business is getting your asses down to the tenth floor for drug testing.
Stanwell and Linford drug tested their employees yesterday.
all we have to do is subpoena the test samples for DNA.
Congratulations. You deserve it.
have a seat, Tyler.
pretty dog-eat-dog world around here, huh?
what, like out of 20 interns only one of you guys get the job, right?
we got some bad news.
uh, what is this, about the drug test?
you could say that.
you tested positive.
for what?
murder.
DNA puts you with Leslie Wright the night she was killed.
she was high, but then, you knew that, didn't you?
psychedelic hallucinogen found in her system lowers inhibitions, makes the user more susceptible to sexual advances.
so when you got her alone, Leslie Wright was yours for the taking.
we were both high.
no, no, not so much.
you see, the ratio of metabolites to parent compounds from the drug test you took tells us you were sober.
you want to know what that means?
you took advantage of a young woman under the influence of a narcotic.
all right, so I wasn't high.
so what?
the bottom line is she didn't say no.
call it whatever you want...
we call it rape.
I'm guessing so did Leslie.
the drug's effects have a short life span.
look, she wanted me.
then it was like she just snapped.
how could you do this to me?! - Stop! No, stop!
you're sick! - No, stop!
get off of me!
so what happened?
did she threaten to go to the cops?
or go straight to big brother?
stop! Stop! - Get off of me!
I'm telling my brother!
get up.
do you believe this?
Fiona's real name was Lorraine Gail, from Topeka, Kansas.
she left home at 19.
found work at the Dorothea as a maid to make ends meet while she got her MBA.
its employees were the only family she had.
what are these, bitch cuffs?
hold still. - My hand, man!
I said hold still!
Cadillac Kligman. Six Million Dollar Man.
six pins in his leg and a bunch of screws loosin his head.
and I was hoping for a slow day.
I'll get started on the paperwork. Better get him out of here.
have fun.
what the hell are you doing?
that's my desk! Get down now!
get on the floor now! - Get in there!
get him down!
I need an ambulance in here! Get me an ambulance!
come on, Todd, come on! - What happened?
I don't know, one minute he was fine, then he started convulsing and he fell over.
come on, kid. Come on!
he's dead.
don, he's dead.
I was questioning him.
he was getting agitated, then he started talking azy.
then he started shaking.
foam was coming out of his mouth and he hit the ground.
don't worry.
Sid will get to the bottom of it.
detective Flack.
you mind answering a few questions? - No problem.
don, don't you want to wait for a union rep?
no, no, no, no. I'd rather take care of this now.
okay, you can start by filling out this incident report.
when did you first encounter Mr. Fleming?
earlier today.
he was at wrestling practice over at Hillridge High School.
detective Angell and I went by and asked him to come downtown with us.
What'd you pick him up for?
because he was a potential suspect the Vincent Nelson homicide and we wanted to ask him questions about his relationship with Mr. Nelson.
and what was the subject's physical condition when you first saw him?
nothing unusual. Maybe he was a little nervous.
cops make some people nervous.
but basically he was fine? - Yes.
no cuts, no bruises, o scrapes? - No.
what about the abrasion on the side of his head?
he walk in with that?
during the interview, he grew agitated.
started flailing around. I had to restrain him.
when I let go, he slipped and fell off the chair.
17-year-old boys don't just slip and fall and then drop dead.
and they also don't require a guardian to be present during questioning.
so maybe you gave him a little push.
you know what?
I changed my mind.
if you want my statement, G. O.15 me.
I want my union attorney.
2 days ago
flying tomato over here took a dip in the garbage while he was snowboarding.
landed right next to the foot.
the rest of the body?
we're canvass garbage receptacles in the area.
the city only picks up trash once a week on account of the budget cuts.
this place is turning into a cesspool.
look what I found.
it's got dried blood all over it.
looks like the foot was wrapped in it.
now I've heard of re-gifting, but this is pushing it.
Danny and Hawkes just found an arm in a trash bin a couple blocks away.
that looks to be male Caucasian.
same as the foot that Mac found.
wrapping paper's a match, too.
I'm thinking Christmas with the in-laws.
degree of decomp puts the time of death between 6: 00 and 9: 00 last night.
mercifully, the dismemberment came later.
kill a man and then chop him up into pieces.
maybe the killer thought little pieces would be easier to dispose of.
there is a certain logic.
any idea what he used to cut him up?
haven't seen this particular wound pattern before.
there's lateral movement at the incision, bordered by these jagged punctures.
maybe I can give you a hand.
okay.
department of Sanitation found it in a storm drain five blocks from the foot.
the top layer of skin is separating from the underlying tissue.
Yeah, it looks like it was submerged in water for a while.
if the glove fits...
oceans And Streams - by The Black Keys
Vince was the head wrestling coach at Hillridge High for eight years.
five championships.
are you positive it's really him? I mean...
I mean, how can you be sure?
maybe there's been some kind of mix-up.
we've identified him by his fingerprints.
every employee in the school system has them on file.
Mrs. Nelson, when was the last time you saw your husband?
yesterday at breakfast.
he was taking a business class at NYU on Thursday nights.
he wanted to open his own wrestling school.
so he never came home last night after class?
I fell asleep.
I called the police in the morning when he wasn't home.
but they said I had to wait 48 hours before he'd be officially missing.
looks like yr husband was quite a successful coach.
Mrs. Nelson, can you think of anyone who might have wanted to hurt your husband?
no. Vince was a great guy.
everyone admired him.
did he owe anybody money?
or have a drug problem or a gambling habit?
I'm sorry...
but if you knew him, you'd know how ridiculous your questions are.
okay. Thank you so much.
please, give us a call us if you remember anything else.
there was one thing.
I don't see how it could be related, but yesterday when I came home from work, someone was lurking on our roof.
I saw their shadows through the skylights there.
looked like two people.
I heard them talking. Creeping around.
it was kind of scary.
what time was this?
around 4: 00.
I knocked one neighbor's door. He said he would go up and check.
And?
he said he saw something that looked like blood, but no people.
she said she saw them from the skylight.
Yeah, this would be the Nelsons' apartment right here.
Yup, here we go.
this is the blood the neighbor was talking about.
boom.
so get this, there's no Thursday night business classes at NYU or any of its extension schools.
and there's no Vince Nelson registered with them period.
nelson was lying to his wife.
he also withdrew 200 bucks from an ATM on the Upper West Side the night he was killed.
maybe he had something going on the side?
confiscate his computer, bank records, credit card statements.
I want to know what else he was hiding. - Done.
what are you working on?
the blood we found on Nelson's roof.
I thought whoever was up there could've been connected to the case, but it isn't human.
take a look.
cells have nuclei, it looks like some kind of animal.
it's a very large animal with claws and scales.
the blood comes from an alligator, Mac.
Mr. Potato Head.
the live version.
more like the bloody dead version.
I used to play Mr. Potato Head as a boy. I would time myself.
see how long it took to assemble him.
some would say I was obsessed.
you, obsessed? No.
I found this stuck in a patch of dried blood on Nelson's torso.
looks like some kind of jewelry.
it's an acupressure magnet.
you put it on a meridian of the ear to quit smoking.
my mom tried everything.
then I'm almost certain it didn't belong to the vic.
his lungs were pink as a baby's.
alas, his spine was not in such pristine condition.
same marks as on the flesh, but it looks like some sort of thermal burn on the bone.
kinetic energy.
whatever the killer used to dismember the body was starting to heat up.
so he must have dismembered the too last.
that explains why we only found burns there.
I also discovered trace in the victim's chest hair.
looks like sawdust.
sawdust. Between that and the thermal burning on the bone,
I'm thinking some kind of chainsaw.
but what type of chainsaw leaves jagged wounds like this?
I Need To Know-by Marc Anthony
mind if I cut in?
prostitution?
come on, Ms. Love, I got a rap sheet here says you've been arrested four times for solicitation.
I'll see you next week, George.
Mm-hmm, okay.
this isn't what you think, Detective.
this isn't what you think either, Ms. Love.
I'm not Vice. I'm with Homicide.
and we have your fingerprint on this acupressure disc.
I bought one of those to quit smoking. I lost it.
well, we found it near this guy. You know him?
that's Vince. Vince Nelson.
why are you looking for him?
because he was killed.
when was the last time you saw him?
last night.
he comes here every Thursday night for a lesson.
exactly what do you teach?
private salsa lessons?
is that what they call it these days?
no, these were legit.
nelson wanted to surprise his wife for their fifth anniversary.
take her out dancing.
and our Salsa instructor had a client right after Nelson who corroborated her alibi.
mac, I found something on Coach Nelson's computer you should see.
this kid can't be more than ten years old.
it gets worse.
all right.
these photos were attached to an e-mail that Nelson sent out to seven of his wrestling students.
this e-mail went out at 4: 00 P. M.Three hours later, Vince Nelson was dea
you think we just found our motive?
someone may've gotten this e-mail and snapped.
but if the Coach Nelson was a pedophile, why would he incriminate himself by sending it outo members of his own team?
maybe he molested some of these boys before and knew they wouldn't tell.
the whole thing makes me sick.
no. Pedophiles usually download photos and trade with other short eyes.
if that's the case, I'm betting there's more where these came from.
find them.
we had one victim, but now we have two.
this boy is too young to be a student at Hillridge High.
we need to know who he is and how Vince Nelson knew him.
I'll reach out to the Bureau of Missing and Exploited Children, see if we can come up with any leads.
pedophile coach.
maybe he got what was coming to him.
the day he died, Nelson e-mailed the photos to seven kids on his wrestling team.
one of them could've been embarrassed, humiliated...
or just flat-out enraged.
I'll track them down, see what they got to say.
found the kind of chainsaw we're looking for.
it's new on the market.
serrated shears on the bottom, chainsaw on the top.
Tool-mark pattern's a match to the body parts we found.
call the manufacturer.
get a list of credit card purchasers, cross reference them against the last names on the e-mails. Did it, done. Nothing.
okay. What about the sawdust?
the sawdust. Still working on it.
the problem is the DNA from the tree contains endogenous chemicals which inhibit analysis.
that means it's gonna be really difficult to narrow it down to a specific species.
well, that tree could point us in the direction of our killer.
go with conventional methods instead.
extract organic compounds, run 'em through the GCMS. - All right.
Hey, I think I just connected the alligator blood that we found on Nelson's roof.
according to the principal at Hillridge High, they had a science fair three days ago.
and the winning project was about the immunological properties of alligator blood.
the creator of this project, Todd Fleming, is also on the wrestling team.
I worked with Coach Nelson every day for three years.
we went to meets together, had a few beers after work, then I find out he's into something like this.
any of the guys on the team talked about the e-mail or the murder?
no, not in front of me, anyway.
we got state championship coming up tomorrow.
that what they're focusing on.
life goes on, right?
not for everybody.
is Todd Fleming around?
we want to ask him a few questions.
Fleming! Front and center.
come on! Keep it going!
look, I don't know anything about what happened, okay?
none of us do.
if that's why you guys came down here...
we found alligator blood on Coach Nelson's roof.
we think it was a part of your science project.
what were you doing up there, Todd?
I wasn't up there. I...
look, even if I was, up there, what does it matter?
cause it's a murder investigation, smart guy. Everything matters.
I didn't kill him.
we'll talk about this downtown.
I'm in the middle of practice. - Practice can wait.
am I under arrest or something?
look, Todd, do you have any street clothes you can change into?
we just want to talk to you.
Yeah, in, in the locker room. - Let's go.
what are these, bitch cuffs?
my hand, man! No!
better get him out of here. - Have fun.
what the hell are you doing?
I want to talk to you about the e-mail Coach Nelson sent you.
what?
the day he was murdered. Hey, Todd, wake up.
I know you got Nelson's e-mail and I know you were on his roof.
it's crazy. This is our fault.
was there someone else involved?
it wasn't supposed...
you talking about Vince Nelson's murder?
can I go or what? - Todd!
your coach was murdered!
now tell me what do I gotta do to get your attention here!
get down on the floor now!
I need an ambulance in here! Get me an ambulance!
preliminary cause of death is hypoxia which presented in cardiac arrest.
did he have a history of brain seizures?
medical records are on the way.
he was a wrestler. He might've had a previous head injury.
there were also several bruises on his arm, fractured ribs.
well, that could've happened while Flack was performing CPR.
what about this abrasion?
based on the lack of subdermal bruising, it occurred moments before death.
you saying Flack hit him?
mac, I'll know more when I open him up, complete my examination.
I did a preliminary tox screen for heroin, cocaine, PCP, methamphetamine, marijuana and alcohol.
all were negative.
don Flack did not kill this boy.
find out what did.
now when you and Detective Flack first approached Todd Fleming, he was at wrestling practice, correct?
that's correct.
and what was his demeanor?
he was fine.
so the kid's calm, perfectly healthy.
he agrees to take a ride with you down to the station house.
he's calm when you walk him through the precinct, he's calm when you bring him in the interrogation room.
and then in less than five minutes, he suddenly becomes agitated, has to be subdued, and now he's dead.
that's exactly what happened.
and if I knew why, I wouldn't be sitting here with you.
did you notice any injuries when you picked Fleming up?
bruises? - No.
was Detective Flack ever alone with him? In the car, maybe?
I drove.
detective Flack sat in the back with Mr. Fleming.
we were together the entire time.
what about at the school?
Fleming was in his street clothes at the time of his death.
I'm assuming he changed somewhere?
in the locker room.
who accompanied him there?
detective Flack.
detective Flack.
doesn't look good.
until you hear different, I'm placing you, on Modified Assignment.
as soon as we're done here, you can surrender your gun and your shield to the Lieutenant downstairs.
what ever happened to giving a guy the benefit of the doubt?
take a look in my personnel folder. Not one civilian complaint.
not one allegation of excessive force. Nothing.
now come on. That's gotta account for something!
the only thing that counts for something is what happened inside this room.
look, Detective Flack did everything by the book.
the guy's a total professional.
unlike your relationship with him, which I understand is less than professional?
not only is that none of your business, but it has nothing to do with Todd Fleming's death.
say hello to the newest member of the rubber gun squad.
I've been officially removed from active duty.
how do they know we're seeing each other, Don?
who? - Internal Affairs.
but I thought we were trying to keep this thing quiet?
I didn't say anything to anyone. That only leaves you.
people talk. They make assumptions.
because of those assumptions now, my word doesn't mean squat with IA.
I mean, who could've told them? - Look, Jess, I'm sorry.
but I got bigger things to worry about right now than squad room gossip.
right.
detective Angell's working this case until IA's finished with their inquiry.
inquiry? Is that what they're calling it?
they can't possibly think that Flack's responsible for Todd Fleming's death.
I mean, he is so by the book. He doesn't even swear.
none of us are happy about this.
in the meantime, IA's got a job to do and so do we.
all right, well, Fleming's been ruled out as a suspect in Coach Nelson's death.
according to his mother, he was taking an SAT prep class at the time of Vince Nelson's murder.
the police confirmed that.
still working on the sawdust, but based on extracted hydrocarbons,
I've narrowed it down to three families.
good. Stay with it.
Yeah, well, I wasn't so lucky with the Christmas wrapping paper.
it's manufactured in China and mass-marketed to department stores all over the U. S.
I'll be right there.
they just found a head.
he's coming together.
cod was hypoxia due to crushed cricoid cartilage which obstructed airflow to the lungs.
lateral bruising on his throat.
he was hit with something hard, a club or a pipe. Look at this.
cauliflower ear. From his wrestling days.
same chainsaw tool marks as the other body parts.
I also found this fleck of blood adhering to the skin at the contusion site on the vic's throat.
and unlike the blood around the wound, this particle was deposited when it was already dry.
which means it could've come from our killer.
Stell, results on the blood fleck that Sid collected from the vic's neck.
not a match to our vic.
Johnny Holt. Ex-con.
he was in for sex crimes. Just got released two weeks ago.
Thanks.
hello.
how are you holding up?
fantastic.
what's a five-letter word for a cooking utensil?
a whisk?
that would be it.
we're all rooting for you.
I want you to know that.
thank you. I appreciate that.
you here to see Johnny Holt?
Yes, I am.
we found his blood on Vince Nelson's throat.
Holt's a bad dude.
if he gives you any problems, let me know.
I'll get in there and beat him up for you.
whisk. I knew that.
never seen him before.
there's traces of your blood on him.
my blood's all over this city.
been shot nine times, knifed five.
we believe the victim was involved in child pornography.
do you recognize this boy?
you implying I'm into kids?
because I sure as hell don't fly that way.
right. Right, you prefer to rape grown women. forgot.
they said it was rape. Not me.
where were you on Thursday?
on a date. - With who?
I didn't catch her name.
but she wasn't as hot as you.
Holt's blood is on the victim, he's got priors and his alibi is just as worthless as he is.
in other words, Mr. Holt just became our prime suspect.
now all we have to do is shore up motive.
I've been working on that.
so far, I haven't been able to find a single connection between him and Nelson.
and I doubt u will.
ribosomal analysis shows that the sample of Johnny Holt's blood that we found on our vic is at least three months old.
while he was still in Sing Sing.
Sid found the dried blood on Nelson's throat.
said he must've been hit there with a pipe or club.
the blood must've been on the murder weapon.
transferred onto Nelson when he was killed.
I think we just found our connection.
no. I've never seen him.
are you sure? He might've been an acquaintance of your husband's?
absolutely not.
what about this boy?
I don't recognize this child at all.
and to save you a question, I have no idea what these pictures are doing on Vince's computer.
ever since this e-mail thing came out the phone's been ringing nonstop.
someone put a pile of dog feces on my doormat this morning.
after school program? The local Y?
look, I'm just going to say this once.
Vince was a normal guy. Okay?
a normal, boring, regular guy.
he watched football in his underwear.
he never took out the garbage unless I told him to.
he forgot our anniversary year after year and tried to make up for it two days later with a, with a bouquet of white roses.
but I didn't care, because he loved me.
Mrs. Nelson, was there anybody on the wrestling team that your husband seemed especially close to?
anyone he saw outside of practice or talked about more than any of the others?
no.
did he seem to have a problem with any of the boys on the team?
look, just because he worked with boys doesn't mean that...
I don't know why I don't just unplug it.
I guess I keep hoping one of these times it'll be someone with something comforting to say!
I - I'm so sorry. We're almost done here.
I know what you're thinking.
Oh, poor woman. How could she possibly deny the fact "that her husband was a pedophile"?
we have these pictures. This e-mail.
well, Vince wasn't a pedophile.
he was a loving, innocent man who was murdered.
why don't you put your energy into finding his killer?
the photos of the boy were downloaded from an international child porn site.
which makes it unlikely that Nelson actually molested him.
I checked the browser and search histories on his computer, there were no additional pornography downloads or searches, not one.
maybe he covered his tracks? Surfed anonymously?
no. The hard drive's clean.
the strange thing is when I checked the firewall log,
I did find a breach on the same day the photos were downloaded.
I'm thinking someone could've pirated his signal.
the alligator blood Stella found puts him on Nelson's roof.
maybe that's what he was doing up there.
okay, so Fleming downloads the photos of the boy, and makes it looks like Coach Nelson sent them.
I mean, it's possible, but why?
clearly, Fleming wanted to discredit Nelson.
making a coach look like a pedophile, that'll do it.
nothing. Nothing.
Nelson's apartment.
stell and Lindsay found the alligator blood over here.
okay, maybe something.
I'm getting a list of networks, but nothing strong enough to connect to.
it means we're in the vicinity.
okay, I've got several network choices now.
signal looks like it's strongest in this direction.
got one Wi-Fi network that's fully unprotected, no password, nothing -- genius.
look what it's called.
Vince N. Wireless Network.
so all Fleming had to do from here was to release a prewritten script to Nelson's computer, turning it into a zombie.
giving him complete control.
the e-mail connects to the murder, I just can't figure out how.
Yeah, well, we know Fleming didn't kill Nelson. He had an alibi.
right, but Coach Nelson's wife said she saw two people up here.
he might've had some help.
there's sawdust over here.
Sid found sawdust on the victim.
but Stella and Lindsay would've found the sawdust when they were here.
not necessarily.
I got good news and I got good news. Which one you want first?
whatever's faster.
all right, the sample of sawdust from the roof is identical to the sample we found in Coach Nelson's chest hairs.
and I finally determined the species it came from.
fagus Sylvatica.
beech Willow Tree.
which is indigenous to Flushing, Queens.
could be where our killer lives.
or just where he set up his chop shop.
see if anyone who got that e-mail hails from Flushing.
got ya.
three count, buddy. You lose.
high school wrestling team?
four brothers. Come on.
whoa, Coach Nelson.
what happened to his neck?
it was separated from his body.
and the rest of him was stuffed in garbage cans all over the city.
whoa, wait, you think I had something to do with this?
we found sawdust on his torso.
sawdust from a tree indigenous to Flushing, Queens.
so?
you're the only kid on the wrestling team who is from Flushing, Queens.
we found that same sawdust on Coach Nelson's roof.
you were up there, weren't you with Todd Fleming?
no.
you leeched off his Wi-Fi signal, sent out the incriminating photos of the young boy.
right, when the coach found out about it, he came to you, and what'd you do?
I - I didn't kill Coach Nelson.
Todd Fleming had an alibi for the night Nelson was killed, which leaves you.
okay! Okay...
Yes, we sent the e-mail, okay?
I'll admit that.
Yeah. Nice.
see, my - my dad, he doesn't make a lot of money.
so the only way I'm going to college is if I get a wrestling scholarship.
coach Nelson, he moved me up a weight class.
that totally wrecked my chance at State Championship.
so we thought if we sent these pictures around, maybe it'll get him fired.
so you e-mailed them to yourselves to throw off suspicion?
Yeah, but that's all we did, okay? We had nothing to do the murder.
Ah, you know what, actually, you kind of did.
cause we're thinking it's those pictures that got your coach killed.
where were you Thursday night?
I was at, uh, school.
I was at a basketball game.
got somebody who can vouch for that?
Yeah, yeah. My, my - my, my Dad. He picked me up around 10: 00.
what's his name?
he works at the Manhattan Superior Court. He's a court officer.
he was struck by something hard, a club or a pipe.
it wasn't the son, it was the father.
court officers have metal batons.
I'm thinking that's what made the bruise on Vince Nelson's throat.
so the father was snooping on the son's computer, saw an e-mail from Coach Nelson...
assumed Nelson sent it. - And confronted him.
the problem is, in order for Johnny Holt's blood to get on Sheridan' baton, they would have to have contact at some point.
right, and that blood is more than three months old, and Holt was still in prison.
let's check it.
prison transfer log from Sing Sing.
here we go, three months ago Holt was taken from Sing Sing to Manhattan Superior Court.
for one day to testify as a witness in a trial.
there must've been some sort of altercation in that courthouse.
that would explain how Holt's blood got on Sheridan's baton.
all right, let's go. Move it, scumbag.
time to get a warrant to search Alex Sheridan's house.
Kyle's whole life was wrestling.
he was 14 when he made the team.
that was the happiest day of his life.
gave him confidence, discipline, a sense of belonging...
I wanted to pin a medal on Coach Nelson.
but when I saw that e-mail, those disgusting photos...
that knocked the breath right out of me.
I picked up the phone and told him I was going to notify the school the very next morning.
so Nelson came to your house to try to settle things in person.
Yeah, except all he did was deny it; said he'd never seen the photos, had no idea where they came from.
see, no one is guilty these days.
everyone's an innocent victim.
I was not about to let my son become a victim.
I fought back.
so what was I going to do?
get 25 to life for killing that son of a bitch?
I see these perverts every day.
they waltz into my court.
they get a slap on the wrist, and then they go off and re-offend.
the only treatment for them is death.
you dismembered him to make it easier to dispose of the body.
I've worked in a courtroom for 16 years.
tough to get a conviction without a body.
there's only one problem.
Vince Nelson didn't send those photos.
I don't understand. I saw them.
they were there with his name on my son's computer.
your son, Kyle sent them.
to himself and six other boys on the wrestling team.
he blamed the coach for ruining his chances at the state championship.
sending the photos from Nelson's e-mail address was his way of getting revenge.
he wanted to get the coach fired.
this whole thing was just a tragic misunderstanding.
wrestle!
you got him!
the Sound Of White -by Missy Higgins
you going somewhere, Don?
Yep, there is no point in me hanging around pushing papers.
it's not my style, Mac.
you've been cleared.
I just heard.
I want you to know, I never doubted you. - Thanks.
you know, for a long minute there, it felt like everybody else did.
Todd Fleming's medical records show that he was prescribed an anti-depressant eight months ago.
when Sid did a screen for that particular drug, he found more than ten times the recommended dosage in his system.
enough to cause the seizure?
found an empty prescription bottle in his locker at school.
I stood by the door while he got changed.
that's the only time he was alone.
God, what a waste.
seems to be a lot of that in this case.
you know, the Rangers are playing tonight.
we could catch the third period at that new sports bar on Lafayette.
I didn't know you liked hockey.
I don't.
I'm so tired of being alone.
shh, shh, I have to get you up, Ella.
get up, come on.
I need help!
hurry, please. She's bleeding.
what happened here?
she tried to kill herself.
cut her wrists.
all right, let's go.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
step aside!
as I watched them roll her away all I could think of was how did Ella get to a place where suicide was her only option?
but Ella's okay, right?
Yeah, she's fine.
mac, this happened, what, a month ago?
why didn't you call me or say anything?
it was a crazy night.
Ella recovered quickly.
it all seemed to be fine.
but now there's a problem?
Yuck!
Oh, my god.
what is it?
it's an eye.
did you get a description of the bird?
Yes, Flack.
it was black, had a beak.
Oh, and it flew with a limp.
I'm just trying to do my job.
I mean, what are the odds?
I was just standing there, and out of nowhere...plop!
I am going to get a cup of coffee.
you want one?
no, thank you.
police business, folks. Keep moving.
nothing to see here, folks, keep moving.
did Stella give you anything more than a hard time.
that's appetizing.
I prefer cream, myself.
that's definitely human.
a few isolated punctures visible in the sclera.
looks like early stages of decomp.
question is...who does it belong to?
how'd you find him?
implantable contact lens.
it's a new alternative to radial kerototomy or Lasik.
Sid found one implanted in our mystery eye.
each lens registered to its owner.
and the best thing is, the name...
comes with an address.
is there any chance that this guy's still alive, just missing an eye?
cause I'm not ready for that.
well, you better get ready, 'cause we're here.
NYPD.
what the hell kind of bird is that?
the kind that ruined a good cup of coffee and ate our vic for lunch.
and here I thought the only vultures in the city worked on Wall Street.
according to Flack, John Pollock was an internet entrepreneur.
his tech start-up is scheduled to go public tomorrow.
he had a spouse.
Yes, Flack is trying to locate her now.
no forced entry.
five floors up.
hubby is buried in the garden, and the wife's in the wind.
maybe she's related to one of these.
most birds of prey prefer fresh carrion.
his body couldn't have been here long.
explains how his eye wound up getting dropped from above.
looks like he's missing some hair, too.
I'm seeing recent plugs.
add that to the corrective eye surgery, and looks like John Pollock's company wasn't the only thing getting an upgrade.
Denite signs of a struggle.
Yep. I got a broken picture frame here with positive blood trace and a partial print.
perp might have handled it.
get a load of this, Mac.
sildenafil prilocaine topical ointment.
it's medicinal hydraulics.
looks like our vic was trying to boost more than his stock price.
you know, I'll tell you what.
I'm two months away from fatherhood-- I don't got any use for it.
why don't you take it?
bag it.
suit yourself.
but by the looks of that wedding photo,
I don't know why Pollock would have needed any help.
Yeah, from the looks of him now help is all he needed.
I was a bit confused on just how the vulture discovered our vic.
evidence suggests the body was completely buried.
Yeah, the objective of the killer was to hide it.
of course. So, how did the bird see it?
that's a good question.
and I found a very fascinating answer.
a vulture can smell the gases produced by the beginning of the process of decay.
I mean, he knew something dead was under that dirt.
any clues as to cause of death?
well, I examined the laceration on the vic's forehead.
shallow penetration might cause a headache, but little else.
what's left of him doesn't give us a clear indication of cod.
and most of the evidence is compromised.
time of death is roughly two days ago.
there are traces of sildenafil and prilocaine on both hands and his genitals.
consistent with the ointment that Danny found next to the vic's nightstand.
so he had sex before the died it would appear that way, but he must have been anxious about it, because there was also a massive amount of bismuth subsalicylate in his blood work.
Antacids?
for a guy who seemed to be doing well he wasn't doing well.
give me a hand.
sure.
stop where you are!
that's flash saying that.
and right beside him is the green lantern.
he's looking all rough and tough and green.
surrender or we'll be forced to take action!
Oh, looks like you just got a match, superhero.
all right...
kiddo, I'll be back.
so the prints I lifted from the broken picture frame in Pollock's apartment so far got me nothing in afis.
the DNA, however, is a different tory.
Oh, same female DNA on the prints, and the tube of ointment.
and the ointment itself is the same as the samples we took from the broken picture frame and the vic's...
I'm thinking the missus is looking better and better for this.
Flack found her.
let's see how good she looks.
look, I don't understand.
why you fingerprint my sister like she's a common criminal?
it's procedure.
okay, if you spent a lot of time in their apartment, we'd like to take your prints as well.
I'm not the guy you're looking for.
I'm never there.
Enrico, please.
flora, you didn't do anything.
how do I explain this to you?
we take elimination...
I don't care-- just tell me what happened to my husband.
we were hoping to speak with you about that, Mrs. Pollock.
Mr. Palmero, why don't you stay here?
this won't take long.
I understand you were in atlantic city.
I was with some girlfriends.
short trip, just for a couple of days.
John wanted me to go.
he said I was lucky.
I came as soon as I heard.
I still can't believe he's gone.
Mrs. Pollock, according to public records, you two were married a year ago soon after you came here from Venezuela?
Yes. Why?
well, if I may speak plainly, you're a very attractive woman.
your husband was just an average guy.
would it be fair to say that you were more interested in a green card than a marriage certificate?
it would be offensive to say that.
my brother and I did come to this country with a dream of staying.
and when I met John, he was willing to turn that dream into reality.
and now his company's about to go public.
I know what you're insinuating.
Yes, marrying him made me legal.
and now that he's dead, all his wealth and his company could be mine.
what is it you call it?
motive?
John was a brilliant, kind, compassionate man, and I fell in love with him.
find who did this to my husband, detective.
please.
he didn't deserve this.
you can go.
what do you think?
she seems believable.
still doesn't wash away Pollock's blood from their wedding picture or the female prints she might have left behind.
trouble is, they're not Flora Pollock's prints.
and look what the atlantic city pd just sent over from the empress grand casino.
they scanned their security tapes like we asked them to, and they found Flora.
her alibi is solid.
and since the prints aren't hers, is it possible our vic had another woman on he side?
the turkey buzzard's head, like its namesake, is bald and red.
its baldness serves an important...
what's up?
behold the turkey buzzard.
uh, cathartes aura.
they're, um, protected by fish and game.
all right, well, that would explain the red tag Flack saw on one of their talons.
but they're not just id bands they're gps trackers used to monitor the birds' migration back and forth to their nests in Manhattan.
I was thinking maybe we could find what's missing of Mr. Pollock.
and that just might lead us to his killer.
according to avian research, this species of vulture is known for gorging itself.
they just eat till they can't eat anymore.
and check this-- when they want to feed their kids, they regurgitate it.
they're like...
all right, you done with your reenactment?
Yeah.
because it looks like we got a problem here.
to find any evidence, we got to get inside the nest.
how are we going to distract these guys?
guess we're going to have to wing it.
are you having as much fun as I am there, buddy?
welcome to my world, Messer.
the low man on the totem pole gets all the exciting stuff.
Yeah, well, what does that make me?
low man on totem pole's friend.
I think we're starting to look likeunch.
I think I just found the appetizer.
piece of our vic?
well, not any piece-- an organ.
his stomach.
DNA confirms it came from our vic.
anything smaller, that bird might have eaten it right there on the rooftop, and we'd have N. Hing tissue looks ralaceted.
it's not from the bird.
Pollock had an ulcer which ruptured, more than likely fatally.
the ulcer explains the high levels of antacid in his blood.
but why bury someone in a rooftop garden if he died of natural causes?
it doesn't make any sense.
it does if the natural causes weren't caused so naturally.
to the batcave, Robin.
I couldn't do it myself, but with the magic of virtual autopsy,
I was able to put much of Mr. Pollock back together again, based on the size of several of the bits and pieces Danny and Adam pulled from the nests.
clearly, before our vultures feasted.
Yes, and...
this is after, with organs intact.
I found a very informative piece of abdominal tissue.
see? There was bruising.
had to happen prior to death.
exactly.
Now...look at the bruise.
it's a fist.
our vic must have been on therong side of a punch to the gut.
dand itidn't take significant force to rupre the tissue, because the stomach wall was already weakened by the ulcer.
the victim bled out internally within minutes.
our killer must have panicked.
didn't know what to do with the body, so he buried it in the garden.
Hey, no surprise.
the blood on the wedding photo belongs to our vic.
problem is, I'm not having any luck with the prints from the mirror or the cream.
Nada!
let me try something.
Yeah, knock yourself out, please.
come on.
Dr. Charlotte Rydell.
well, what the hell did you just do?
the sildenafil lidocaine ointment may have been dispensed by a doctor.
the size of the tube is consistent with samples physicians hand out to their patients.
right, right. Not what you'd get from a pharmacy.
right, and this is the dea physicians database: prints from every licensed doctor.
I do love you, doc, but I often want to smack you.
let's go talk to the good doctor.
all right.
Hey, Hawkes, by the looks of this bedroom decor,
I'm guessing this doctor treats a little more than a fever and a cough.
how can I help you, detectives?
uh, it sounds like you want to get right to the point, doctor, so why don't you tell us what your schedule was like two days ago?
I was probably here working in the office all day.
what kind of medicine do you practice, exactly?
I mean, I don't want to assume anything.
this all could just be in bad taste.
the sexual arts play a major role in our happiness, but who teaches us?
I supply hands-on instructions.
I'm a happiness surrogate and licensed psychiatrist.
and John Pollock wasetting a little surrogate sex?
I'm sorry, I don't discuss my clients.
what about former clients?
he's dead.
wh-what are you talking about? When?
did you know Mr. Pollock was married?
most of my clients are.
and their wives are my biggest beneficiaries.
and from what John Pollock told me, his wife Flora was responding to his increased level of skill.
so, you ever make any cause lls?
this is a legitimate practice, detective.
I work out of this office.
well, that's odd, because we found your fingerprints in Mr. Pollock's bedroom.
any idea how that happened?
all right, yes.
um, now that I think about it, one of my clients canceled, and I took the opportunity to go to his apartment.
to talk.
about what?
his last three checks bounced.
he wasn't returning my calls.
I went over there to tell him I was going to proceed with legal action if he didn't pay me.
I tried to take back a tube of sample cream I gave him.
he said he'd pay me as soon as some big deal came through.
Dr. Rydell, your fingerprints were on a framed photograph of Mr. Pollock and his wife that was thrown across his b om and actually nicked him in the head.
all right, I might have thrown something in frustration.
something?
it was their wedding photo.
you sure there was nothing personal going on between you and Mr. Pollock?
like I said, detective, it was strictly business.
doctor, I really would like to believe you, but it sounds more like funny business to me.
the first impression Sid found on our vic's abdomen is a partial, so it doesn't give us much for a match.
and it didn't take a lot of force to cause the tissue to rupture, so...
a woman, or a man...basically, anybody could have done this.
its more than likely someone who had access to the apartment or at least someone Pollock knew or didn't feel threatened by.
he let them in.
no, I believe her.
I...I don't think she killed him.
I think she really did just fall in love with this guy.
he came to her rescue, and sometimes that's enough to see the beauty behind the beast.
you never finished your story.
my story?
Ella. Before the evil eye dropped into my latte,
I had this feeling that you were fishing for some advice.
you've known me too long.
hmm, don't you forget it.
Ella's living in a halfway house.
she's been there since she got out of the hospital.
I'm glad she's getting some help.
she called, and she wants to see me.
and, uh, I'm not sure whether paying her a visit will help or hurt.
I've always said,"case closed," but I just can't shake this one.
with her father murdered and her mother in jail,
I just feel like I should do something.
well, it sounds like this is about more than just a visit.
ever since I met this young woman, she has been crying out for help, but no one's listened.
even when she was living with both her parents, she was looking for companionship on the internet.
she slit her wrists to get my attention.
and damn if she didn't get it.
I feel responsible, Stella.
she fabricated evidence, Mac...
this was sent to me.
jeopardized our case, and very cleverly insinuated her way into your life.
detective Taylor?
uh, you, you want to have breakfast?
doesn't mean I shouldn't help her.
she's not your responsibility.
you sound like me.
this conversation is always reversed.
I'm the one who's driven by my emotions, and you're the guy who goes by the book.
I'm a little confused here, Mac.
you really care about her.
we focus day in and day out on finding the criminal, and then we tell ourselves that it'll bring closure to the victims and their families.
and it does.
you know that.
Yeah.
I also know that the emotional trauma of a young woman should not be the occasional assignment of a couple of social workers fresh out of college.
I just want her to get better.
I see a bright...
intelligent young woman in Ella.
I understand that.
but we've done our job.
move on.
if you open that door, what next?
you can't save them all.
I know, I know.
I've said that and more too many times to count.
I guess I just needed to hear it from you.
you want to tell me what that was all about?
the vic's clock radio made a little noise every time you wal, and it sounded like a, a digital mechanism.
it's a camera lens.
nanny cam.
must be operated by a hidden motion sensor.
here's the camera.
and a power source.
battery pack.
and it might have recorded the murder.
that's Danny at the crime scene.
go back a little further, Adam.
John plock had been dead at least a day and a half by the time we arrived.
Danny found the clock on its side.
zoom in.
let's see who it is, Adam.
that's definitely not our vic.
odd.
I'm not sure it's even human.
I see a digital clock there.
5: 04 P. M.
the clock puts this guy in the vic's apartment very close to the time of death, but the murder was out of view of the camera.
Adam, get me some more details on the face.
definitely.
we could be looking at John Pollock's killer.
this is what we pulled off the nanny cam in Pollock's apartment.
I cleaned up the image.
the face is still a little fuzzy, but I'm shooting it through the mug shot database, see if I can get anything.
you ever seen anything like that?
it appears to be straight out of some disturbing fairy tale.
extreme body piercing-- uh, it's a, it's a new trend.
should I even ask?
pain, art, individuality.
some people get their belly buttons done, nose rings.
I had this girlfriend once-- she used to pierce her tongue a lot.
Ah, no match.
what about break - ins in the buildin or witnesses who might have seen a guy that fits this description?
I'll call Flack to see if he has any reports of a horny perp in the area.
I'm sorry, boss, I...
I want an answer, and soon.
totally, yeah.
Hey, guys, I processed this letter I found in the victim's clothes.
dear Mr. Pollock, please be advised "that an unlawful detainer action has been fil against you for the delinquent payments "relating to the above-referenced premises."
pursuant to the provision... fees are due.
and on and on and on.
could be a disgruntled business associate or an investor we're looking for.
could be, except the letter is a fake.
the firm of Cundieff, Cochran & Byars -
that doesn't even exist, except for a pool-cleaning service out in L. A.
so whoever sent the letter was trying to extort the vic using a bunch of B. Ords maybe pollock caught on and was going to go to the authorities.
before he could, he was killed.
the question is: by who?
well, I think I might have an answer to that question.
there's a government anti-counterfeiting program.
and this has something to do with our case?
be patient.
right, sorry.
thank you.
every color laser printer in the past 20 years is required to have what I would call a hidden fingerprint.
so I scanned this letter.
I eliminated the colors one by one...
and I was able to enhance...
a printer fingerprint, so to speak.
right.
the unique identification of a single printer is beneath the ink.
could help us locate the creator of the fake law firm.
exactly.
now, the printer company had the owner on file and warranty information.
turns out it's the landlord of Pollock's apartment building.
guy named Quentin Oswego.
boom.
are you ready...
on my right, weighing in at 109 and 1/2 pounds, from Jamaica, queens, Miss Sally Burnside!
and on my left, weighing in at 111 3/4 pounds, from far Rockaway, New York, okay, ladies...
keep your claws in your paws.
no biting.
fight!
NYPD.
here to ask you a few questions.
what's this about?
why don't we start with public ugly, then we'll move on to murder?
no way you can prove this is me.
can't even tell what color this guy's eyes are.
unfortunately for you, there aren't many landlords in this city that have horns on the top of their heads.
obviously you're not familiar with the Manhattan real estate market.
well, what we do know, Mr. Trump, is that you were in Mr. Pollock's apartment.
how does a low-grade scumbag like you come to own a place like that anyway?
inherited from my low-grade scumbag parents.
they also teach you how to extort your tenants?
see, this is the phony letter that you sent Pollock, telling him that he owed you money.
you spelled "delinquent" wrong.
so?
so extortion is a class "B" felony in the state of New York.
now, we can leave it at at.
at least we got you on something.
all right, yeah, I was in the apartment, but just to mess with the wiring.
I blew a fuse.
just like last week, I plugged up the toilet.
destroying your own property?
that makes sense from a guy who screws horns into the top of his head.
rent stabilization's a bitch.
that Pollock guy is paying me $2, 500 a month for a place that's worth 15 grand.
that sound right to you guys?
so you didn't like the FT that he was paying you below market value for your place.
and when he wouldn't leave, you decided to get a little more forceful with him.
I have a legal right to be here.
you want to see some harassment?
I never touched the guy.
I never even saw him.
so either read me my rights or get the hell out of my face.
before we go, why don't you take your right fist and put it in this box for me, all right, big guy?
whoa, I answered your questions, told the truth.
well, yeah, that remains to be seen.
come on.
good. -You got any weapons on you, other than what's in your head?
turn around.
Oh, you got to be kidding me.
now, you didn't think we were going to let you get off on that extortion charge, did you?
you guys are messed up.
you got horns in your head, buddy, and we're messed up?
you good?
let's see if Danny gets a match with that fist print.
you want my opinion?
I say back to those buzzard vultures.
you seen those things?
I'm telling you, Mac.
well, find me one who can throw a punch and bury a body.
case closed.
911. What's your emergency?
my sister...somebody tried to kill my sister.
who found her?
her brother said he went over to her apartment to check on her and found her like this.
called 911, and here we are.
was she raped?
not sure.
the doctor said there's evidence of sexual activity, but we don't know if it was rape.
tell them to send the samples directly to the lab.
is she...she's hanging in there.
Ella era Tan Bella.
she was so beautiful, and now she...
I know this is difficult.
but I need you to tell me what happened.
I don't know what happened.
I just found her.
she was bleeding, she could barely breathe.
the door was opened.
someone attacked her husband and you people couldn't think to give her a little protection?
Mr. Palmero, our highest priority is to find the person who did this to your sister and her husband.
now, we've got a crime team over to her apartment and they'll be talking to the neighbors to see if anyone saw anything.
I also need your help.
what is that?
I'd like to take a swab of the inside of your mouth.
this will help us distinguish your DNA from that of your sister's attacker.
whatever it takes to find him.
great.
Hey, Stella.
Yeah.
Danny, you find anything here?
Nah, nothing we could use.
all the blood is loc ized where the paramedics found Flora's body.
phone is off the hook, but that's consistent with Enrico's 911 call.
same as the last time, there's no signs of forced entry.
flora Pollock is still unconscious, and her brother didn't see anything.
so, we don't have a description of her attacker.
Stella did FD trace on Flora's body and she photographed some bruising that she hopes to match to the subdermal bruise that Sid found on John Pollock's abdomen, but she's not optimistic.
now, the semen that she collected indicates recent sexual activity and she's waiting on DNA.
so, Flora's attacker is a man.
her beating has to be connected to her husband's death and if the same person committed both crimes, we're looking for someone with access to the apartment.
I'm thinking that's Quentin.
he was already out on bail, and he has a key.
you know who else would have a key?
Flora's brother.
I recovered this at the beginning of the nanny-cam footage.
it could've happened a month ago or more.
it's Enrico and Flora.
that's not how I treat my sister.
whatever's going on, she's definitely not into it.
Hey. Sorry, I gotta pull rank, Adam.
I recovered Enrico's 911.
m-my sister!
she's covered in blood!
I think she was beaten!
I need help!
sir, where are you calling from?
2955 Franklin, please!
I need help!
pal, I want you out!
did you hear that in the background?
sir, where are you calling from?
mac, listen to this.
it's Enrico's 911.
not on the lease, pal! I want you out!
the voice is talking about the lease.
that's gotta be Quentin, the landlord.
Quentin was knocking on the door while Enrico was making the 911 call.
so, Quentin couldn't have beaten up Flora.
he never even made it into the apartment.
so, Enrico beat up Flora?
and called 911 as a cover-up.
Hey, DNA from the semen that was collected in Flora's rape kit came back as a match to Enrico.
wait a minute, her brother was her lover?
no, I compared Enrico's DNA to Flora's.
there's no match.
so, barring adoption those two are not brother and sister.
they've been lying to us the whole time.
and possibly also lying to John Pollock.
this was a scam.
they were working as a couple.
taking him for a ride, for a green card or maybe later for money.
so, then Enrico attacks Flora?
I mean, I don't get it.
why would he beat her up?
maybe Flora fell in love with John Pollock.
had a change of heart.
enrico Palmero, nypd!
open up!
Hey, stop!
Hey! Hey!
go!
sorry, folks.
just had some cleaning up to do.
it was all a scam, Enrico.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Yeah, you do.
Pollock had you on tape trying to kiss Flora.
you-you're crazy.
flora is my sister.
come on, she's no more your sister than I am.
he captured you and Flora in the act.
the computer monitor in the apartment was still on.
it was on DVD mode.
the poor guy, he just wanted to catch the landlord on tape, and he got that and much more.
once you found out he was onto you, you decided to take matters into your own hands.
the company goes public, Pollock's widow gets lots of money.
she doesn't even have to divorce him.
she simply inherits everything he has and marries you.
you get the money and the girl, and you live happily ever after.
a very impressive plan.
there wasn't a plan.
Oh, sure there was.
but what you didn't count on was her falling in love with John and leaving you high.
she wasn't in love with him.
she was playing along.
being beaten within an inch of her life, was that just playing along?
Pollock wasn't half the man I am.
he was nothing.
he was gonna be rich, and that's why she fell for him.
if that was true, you never would've killed him.
I didn't think you'd come.
I had the time.
somehow I don't believe that.
so, thank you.
I get out in a few days.
you know where you're gonna go?
I've been trying to get in touch with a few friends, see if I can crash with them for a while, get a job, an apartment.
start over.
you don't think I'm ready.
no, no, no, it's...
I was just thinking of a friend of mine, Mitchell Davis.
when we were kids his brother died in a skating accident.
and the last thing that Mitchell said to him was,"you're gonna be okay."
and then he left him...
wobbling on the blades of his skates.
he knew he could do it.
he wanted him to stand on his own two feet.
and then the ice broke, and Randy went down and drowned.
Mitchell stayed away from school for a long time after that and when he finally came back nobody really knew what to say to him.
"I'm sorry" just didn't seem to be enough, and I don't know why I said this or where these words came from, but I looked at him and I said...
"you're gonna be okay, Mitchell."
then he smiled.
and he started crying, and then we both were crying, and...
I found out a few weeks later that...
those were the first tears he shed.
you're gonna be okay, Ella.
and if you ever need anything, if you ever have any doubts...
if I should ever get a little bit wobbly?
Yeah.
you call me.
okay?
okay.
where are we going?
I know a place that makes a great espresso.
Hey, have you heard the latest urban legend?
a woman goes to take a sip of her coffee, and an eyeball falls right in the cup.
that's impossible.
you'll pay me $10, 000 up front and another ten grand when the job's done.
on the day I finish our contract, a dozen white roses will be sent to your office.
don't attempt to contact me.
if you need to communicate, go to the steps at the main entrance of the Central Post Office 3: 00 in the afternoon.
I'll find you.
this meeting will be the last time you'll see me.
once you pay me, changing your mind is a complication that's going to cost you.
so I got to ask you one more time.
are you sure you want him dead?
buy you a cup of coffee, Mr. Neville?
do I know you?
detective Mac Taylor.
I was called to the scene of the accident.
I don't remember.
I've tried to contact you seral times since then.
you refused my calls, wouldn't allow me to visit, so you left me no choice but to be here today.
and now you're here?
I was wondering if we could talk.
Why?
because you just spent 18 months in prison for a crime you didn't commit.
Adam, have you seen Danny?
he left about 20 minutes ago with Doc to a crime scene on the Upper West Side.
what about, uh, Stella or Mac?
Stella's in court and the boss took a day off.
Yeah, can you believe it?
mac never takes a day off.
I don't think there's been one day since I've worked here that he hasn't showed up.
he's like,"Hey, I'm not coming in," you know, although he did go to London that one time, but I don't...
Adam, okay, enough. - What?
I just got back from Montana. I-I'm not ready to deal with you.
okay.
this is not how I imagined it. - What?
I need you to focus, Adam. - Okay.
go get a set of keys to a car, any car.
meet me in the garage in five minutes.
my water just broke.
I'm about to go into lab and you are taking me to the hospital.
go! - Okay.
Adam... - ah, wrong way, sorry, j-just relax.
everything's going to be okay.
here you go. Thanks very much.
so it was your fault?
what do you mean?
I just spent 18 nthsin Rikers.
you show up on the day I get out and tell me I shouldn't have been there in the first place?
two years ago your vehicle struck and killed Maris Donovan.
you claimed that you were behind the wheel, but I believe someone else was driving.
so, I'm just curious, why would you take responsibility for something you didn't do?
you think that's what happened?
Yes, I do.
unfortunately, all I've got is circumstantial forensic evidence and a gut feeling.
none of which the DA will pay any attention to without the truth from you.
why would I lie about something like that?
why would I sentence myself to prison?
because you didn't think you'd go to prison, Talmge.
or if you did go to prison, you'd get three months, tops.
or maybe you'd just get slapped with a fin
but instead, a very unsympathetic judge made an example of you, and there was no way you uld have predicted that would happen.
and there was no way you could get out of it once you took the blame.
a detective chasing theories, huh?
what I'm chasing is the truth.
someone committed a crime and got away with it.
there was no one else in that car.
well, that's what we believed that night because that's what you told us, but I have evidence that suggests otherwise.
circumstantial evidence?
thanks for the coffee.
Oh, no! No! No! Oh, no!
no, I-I can't... I can't tell if she's breathing!
I don't know if she's alive!
somebody help!
I'm a doctor. I might be able to help.
somebody call 911.
please be okay.
call an ambulance!
it's a terrible accident.
it's just awful, Mac. She's so young.
her name is Maris Donovan.
the deli owner says she comes in occasionally.
thinks she lives around the block.
was he the one driving the car?
said he didn't see her until it was too late and did everything he could to avoid the collision.
he swerved, and his car slammed into the lamppost.
is he okay?
paramedics checked him out.
despite the damage to the car, he appears to be physically fine.
emotionally, he's struggling to hold it together.
intoxicated?
no. Passed the sobriety.
this is a bad one.
any witnesses?
no one that can help. Most of these folks just heard the noise.
a passerby tried to revive her before ESU got here, but...
was there anyone else in the car?
no, he was alone.
What'd you find?
looks like he was texting while driving.
Where's my daughter?
ma'am, I'm sorry, you can't touch the body.
Oh, no!
Mrs. Donovan.
no, no!
listen, listen, listen, I'm...
did you do this? - I am so sorry. It was an accident.
look what you've done to my daughter! Look what you did to her!
give her back... Mrs. Donovan, please!
Mrs. Donovan!
Oh, no!
Oh, no!
why isn't she answering her phone?
doc, take 57th right there. It'll be faster.
Danny, I got this, I got this. All right.
voicemail again.
baby, it's me. We're close, okay?
hold on till I get there, okay?
I don't want to miss this. I love you. I love you, okay?
watch out, man!
okay, right here, Doc, Doc, Doc, okay, right there.
make a right, go around the corner and pull into Emergency.
Hey, Danny, congrats, brother.
Thanks, Doc.
okay, here's what you're looking for.
Talmadge Neville's parole officer is Jerome Addison.
condition of his parole is that he check in within four hours of his release.
I've got an address up on East 59th Street.
Hey, I thought you were taking the day off.
just looking into some unfinished business.
it's the, uh, car accident, right? He was texting?
I thought that case was pretty cut and dry.
he did 18 months. Got out this morning.
Hey, Mac, most people on their days off take in a museum, a matinee, catch up on some sleep.
here you are digging up a closed case.
our lab didn't analyze the evidence collected at the scene because at the time Neville took full responsibility.
well, makes sense.
he was driving the car.
maybe not.
okay. So you've processed that evidence.
and now you have a different heory?
nothin definitive, but certainly enough to have reasonable doubt.
you were that kid in school who did all the extra credit projects, weren't you?
you made all the rest of us look bad.
three months ago I slammed on the brakes in my car to avoid a collision with the vehicle in front of me.
my shoulder restraint jolted back.
and I was, I was sore within an hour and for a few days afterwards.
my left shoulder was bruised from where the restraint tightened.
that moment triggered a memory.
the night of Talmadge Neville's accident, I remember quite clearly he was rubbing his right shoulder.
which would put him in the passenger seat.
and suggests someone else was driving.
I suppose I could just let this go.
but Don, I can't forget the look on Katherine Donovan's face when she saw her daughter lying lifeless in that street.
I remember thinking, I'm so glad this isn't a hit and run.
that this man took full responsibility for what he'd done.
he didn't claim the brakes didn't work, he didn't point the finger at the victim.
there was something so tragic yet decent about it all.
and now I believe someone else is involved.
and that someone thinks they got away with it? No.
that's not how this is going to end.
thanks for this.
Mr. Neville, get in.
what the hell do you want, Detective?
the truth, a name.
I have nothing to say.
all right, then I'll do the talking. Come on.
I heard it already.
look, Talmadge, I'm not going away.
I could call your parole officer.
he might wonder why a detective from the crime lab is asking so many questions.
that would definitely complicate things for you.
come on, get in.
start telling your story.
my lab recovered your vehicle from the impound yard.
I recreated the reported speed of the car d simulated the object of impact and placement of the phone and not once did the cell land on the front passenger side floor where you recovered it.
and in Neville's vehicle, the power adjustment gears under the seat are too bulky for an object just to slide forward.
but that doesn't definitively eliminate the possibility that the driver was holding the phone.
but it makes it more plausible that someone in the passenger seat was.
which brings us to the prints.
now, Neville's left thumb print was on both the driver and passenger seat belt release button.
well, he certainly could've been a passenger in his own car at another time other than the accident.
Yes, he could and I thought about that but...
this is Talmadge Neville's thumb print lifted from the driver's side release button.
now, based on the position of the apex and the delta points, it appears that Neville released the belt from the passenger seat.
but there is another possibility.
he could have used his left hand from the driver's seat.
doc, I thought about that, too.
but why would he reach all the way across his body and turn his thumb 180 degrees to releasthe button?
I mean, it's an unnatural action.
but easily accomplished from the passenger seat.
leads me to conclude that Neville released that belt to let someone else out.
there was no one else in that car.
I struggled with my seat belt.
I panicked, couldn't get out.
the evidence doesn't suggest that.
your thumb pressed that button once and lifted.
you had no problem releasing the belt.
and the direction of the print implies that you weren't in the driver's seat.
why would I lie? What would I gain?
I am now and forever an ex-con. Unemployable, unreliable, unworthy.
it doesn't sound like something a man chooses if he's got an ounce of common sense.
you see that vendor there?
that was my life before all this happened.
I was a single father, working 10, 12 hours a day, seven days a week, peddling dogs and pretzels, earning an honest living for my kids.
my son, Joe, is now a professor.
and my daughter, Karita, she's a surgeon.
and wouldn't you like them to know the truth?
were you in the car with someone you shouldn't have been?
were you or your family threatened if you didn't keep this secret, Talmadge?
when you were in Rikers, you refused to have any other visirs except one.
he's head of the Local 515, the City Sidewalk Cart Union.
I wanted to know what would happen to my business.
he's also a pretty tough guy who shakes down vendors for a cut.
haven't seen you in a while, Talmadge.
I been busy.
what do you say we take a ride?
Hey, look, Nick, I'm really tired, now. You know, I've had a long day.
I'll tell you what. I'll drive. You listen.
Nick was not in the car.
then who was?
you weren't behind the wheel of the car that hit Maris Donovan.
the right person should be punished for the crime.
the debt has been paid.
unfortunately, Talmadge, that's not a decision you get to make.
Yeah, I need to order a dozen roses.
delivered tonight after 5: 00.
white.
do they really think that I'm just going to walk this baby right out of me?
why can't I be one of those women who just sneezes and bere you can say, God bless you, she's had the baby?
think of what you'd miss out on.
reminding your child of all those long, painful hours of labor that you endured to bring them into this world.
I guess I could get some mileage out of that.
I'm kinda scared, Stella.
that's normal, Lindsay.
just remember, you're healthy and strong.
you and Danny went through all the courses.
Yeah, no, I don't mean about having the baby.
about beining a mom.
I mean, what if I stink at it?
and the worse part is I won't know until it's too late.
she'll come home, she'll scream that she hates me, then in rebellion she'll get some part of her body pierced that's inappropriate.
and she'll get an infection, and she'll wind up on antibiotics which we find out 12 years later they cause an eating disorder and pretty soon I'm in therapy trying to save my whole family.
I mean, what if some people just aren't cut out to be parents?
well, the fact that you already thought about all this, tells me that you're gonna do just fine, Linds.
I'm losing it, huh?
Yeah.
Oh, contraction.
what if she has twins, Adam?
I mean, you hear stories about people being completely surprised.
and you've seen Lindsay, right? I mean, she's huge.
she knows it.
relax, you got the ultrasound.
it's not twins, all right?
you gonna be okay?
no, no, I'm not.
feel like I might go into cardiac arrest while she's giving birth.
mac, you're here.
no, no, she hasn't yet.
Oh, we're on the fourth floor.
all right, I'll be right there.
my daughter, Karita, she's a surgeon.
Dr. Karita Neville, please report to the second floor nurses station, Tower Two.
is that a picture for your grandma?
beautiful, I like that.
okay, well, I'll see you later.
she was driving the car.
you're sure it was Dr. Neville?
positive, I remember her face.
she was at the accident scene.
that's who Talmadge Neville was protecting, his daughter.
she had to be the one driving the car, not him.
and then she just blended into the crowd and watched as he took the fall?
why would she do that?
it's possible that they traded places because she had more to lose if she was behind the wheel of the car.
I remember Flack saying that someone tried to revive the victim before the paramedics arrived.
is it possible that it was Karita Neville?
I mean, she is a doctor.
maybe there's something in Sid's autopsy report of Maris Donovan that can confirm that.
well, we know she was there. You can ID her.
Yeah, but we need something that puts her at the scene very close to the time of the accident.
something thatays there was no other place she could have been except in that car.
we should go, Mrs. Donovan.
how much time will he get?
most likely he'll be charged with second degree manslaughter.
time he serves will be up to the judge.
meaning he could simply get probation and his license revoked?
Mr. Neville's been very cooperative. He's remorseful.
this whole thing-- - Yes, I know, it was an accident.
everybody keeps saying it was an accident.
just doesn't feel like that on this side of the glass.
Oh, that man was stupid and reckless.
in one split second, he took my daughter's life.
and he has to live with that.
unfortunately, so do I.
did you need something?
uh, I was wondering if you could pull an old autopsyile.
maris Donovan.
came in here about two years ago.
you working on your day off?
why is it that everyone is so concerned with what I do on my day off?
are you kidding?
I mean, come on, you never take a day off.
Yes, all right.
the file?
it's taking a minute to come up.
you looking for something specific?
car accident victim, 16 years old. Two years ago.
was there anything to suggest that she was alive for even a few minutes at the scene of the car accident?
I don't recall.
however... different monitor, different equipment.
I have a database of CT scans...
and I'm quite sure I have one for Maris Donovan.
Yeah, it's coming back to me now.
I believe I noted that the bruises here were inconsistent with the accident injuries.
but... because they are red in color, I can conclude that they occurred very close to death.
placement on the body and the size are consistent with compression marks?
Yes, someone could have attempted CPR, but they must have been there right after impact, because, based on these other injuries, Maris Donovan didn't live very long after the accident.
Karita Neville is a doctor.
she may be the one who assisted the victim at the crime scene, and your time line just might put her in the car.
all right, autopsy report.
strange. Yours is the second request for this particular case this week.
that rarely happens for one this old.
who made the first request?
usually, it includes a name, but this says "Confidential.
my father was in that accident.
and so were you, Dr. Neville.
you switched places.
there was much more risk for you to be behind the wheel than your father, because eight years ago, you were charged with a DWI.
with one more conviction, you could face 15 years.
detective, I'm going to say this one last time.
I wasn't in that car.
now, I have patients.
I'm in awe of your unwavering commitment to the lie.
can't imagine what it was like to watch your father cuffed and later locked up, knowing the whole time that it should have been you.
15 months were added to his sentence for being accused of texting while driving, only he was texting from the passenger seat.
I'm just curious.
was there a moment that you ever felt guilty?
the debt has been paid.
no, Dr. Neville.
no debt is paid when the wrong person is convicted.
I don't want you to forget my name.
you're going to be seeing me again.
Mrs. Donovan, we believe it was Karita Neville who was behind the wheel of the car that killed your daughter and not her father Talmadge Neville.
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
how do you expla this?
and why didn't you know this then?
well, I'd like to discuss the details of our investigation, but I'm...
you're starting a new investigation?
Yes, yes. That's why I'm here.
I wanted to tell you personally.
it's been two years.
that man spent 18 months in prison.
I know that none of this is easy to hear, and revisiting what happened all over again...
I won't do it.
I can't do it, Detective.
I'm still waiting for the morning when I no longer believe I hear Maris singing in the shower down the hall.
well, thanks for the information.
I would prefer that you involve me as little as possible.
I'm sorry to rush you out, but I have a meeting.
of course.
Flack, see if you can track down Neville.
I think he'd be interested in what we know.
Talmadge Neville, NYPD!
go ahead.
we're clear.
we're clear over here.
Hey, how's Lindsay?
seven hours and counting.
she dilated past one centimeter yet?
that's kind of a personal question, Adam.
Oh, sorry. I-I just have 18 hours and 15 minutes in the hours of labor office pool.
600 bucks on the line, yo.
what's up with the bike pedal?
Flack found it at Neville's apartment.
what was strange, though, is that it was wrapped in copies of Maris Donovan's autopsy report, and it was painted completely white.
analysis of the paint says it's pretty heavy duty.
Yeah, it's something you would use to paint the exterior of a house.
there's a void on the spindle threads.
suggests that it was still attached when it was painted.
but if that's the case, there should be some kind of wear pattern from a shoe.
but there's barely a scratch.
means nobody rode it.
you said that Flack found this at Talmadge Neville's apartment?
Yep. Just the pedal, no bike.
ghost riders.
ghost riders. Follow me.
those bikes are all over the city.
they're in memory of people who lost their lives in bike accidents.
they're called ghost riders.
somebody died in a bike accident down there?
Yeah.
and I'd be willing to bet that the pedal in our lab is from a bike in memory of Maris Donovan.
somebody didn't want Talmadge Neville to forget why he spent the last 18 months in prison.
you asked to see us, and we're here, so...?
you know this guy?
what about him?
he should be lying in an alley right now with a bullet between his eyes.
excuse me?
and how do you know that?
you were gonna do him, weren't you?
so what's your beef with Talmadge Neville?
let's just say I'm a guy with a specific skill set.
and I got the constitution to commit acts that other people don't have the courage to.
you're a hit man.
I'm not familiar with that term.
sorry, contract killer. Is that what you prefer to put on your business cards?
I'm not interested in playing games, Mr. Desoto.
what are you doing here?
my client had a change of heart.
who's your client?
an hour ago, I received word that the new beneficiary of my services is supposed to be this girl right here.
something tells me your client wasn't the only one that had a change of heart.
no women, no children.
a hit man with a code of ethics. How noble.
who hired you, Mr. Desoto?
don't know her name.
how about a description?
female, late 40s.
I had a meeting with her once.
she was wearing sunglasses and a wig.
if you find her, don't go asking me to come pick her out of a lineup, 'cause I pretty much got "I don't recall" down pat.
thank you.
you've done the right thing here.
Hey, look, I didn't come in here for a pat on the back, Detective.
this woman's desperate.
I get the feeling, with or without me, she's gonna get this done.
just checked with the hospital.
Karita Neville finished her shift two hours ago.
I left a message with the answering service.
we've tried her cell and home phone, haven't gotten an answer.
just keep calling.
Flack has uniforms at Neville's apartment.
we checked in with his parole officer, and Neville never indicated what he had planned for the day except to say he would look for a job.
he used to be a street vendor.
see if he's tried to contact any of those companies or Nick Donley about work.
let's also try to contact his cell mate at Rikers.
see if Neville mentioned any special plans.
mac, female prints I lifted on the photo of Karita Neville didn't get any hits in AFIS so no ID.
but they were a match to the prints I found on the autopsy report recovered in Neville's apartment.
easy to put two and two together.
only this time, it adds up to one.
are Talmadge and Karita Neville alive, Mrs. Donovan?
that's an odd question to ask me.
are they safe?
those flowers are from a friend.
he was supposed to do me a favor.
but he couldn't.
turns out, I didn't need it done anyway.
I know about grief, Katherine.
about losing someone you care about.
I lost everything when I lost her.
make sure to get brown and white rice in the bag.
and don't stop for any junk food, Maris.
I got it, Mom.
okay.
be caref. I lo you.
mom, I'm just going around the corner.
it's been two years. It still hurts so badly!
I lost my wife on 9/11.
some days... it seems like it was so long ago.
others... like it was just yesterday.
I wish I could promise that you'd stop missing Maris, hearing her voice or imagining she'll be there when you get home, but... I can't.
I'm so ashamed that I let this consume me.
I'm so afraid that if I stop thinking about it, it'll be like I forgot her.
but you came here for another reason.
so what now, Detective?
compassion.
grief is an emotion that can force a good and decent person tmake a very, very bad decision.
and knowing that, I have a choice to make.
I can do everything I can to prove that you were involved in a conspiracy to commit murder.
right now, I have no witness, no paper trail, no confession.
or... I can show a little compassion.
are you sure I deserve that courtesy, Detective?
I believe Maris' mother deserves it.
however, I want to be clear.
if you violate the law in any way, I will, without hesitation, gather all the proof I need to prosecute you for this offense to the full letter of the law, you understand?
that, Katherine, I can promise.
thank you.
still no Talmadge Neville.
I was about to report the same thing about his daughter, but...
I'll tell you everything you want to know.
I'll tell you the truth.
your brother even whines in his text messages.
he says,"It was not fair.
is he crazy?
you tell him I don't care how much more money I make. He owes me.
he lost that Super Bowl bet.
K, you good?
Yeah, I think so.
we gotta get out of the car.
dad, there's a girl in the street. I think she's hurt.
come on. Get out. Get out. Come on. Get out of here. Get out of here. You gotta leave.
Oh, but Dad, she's hurt.
this is an accident that can ruin everything you worked for!
get out of here! Get out of here now! Go, go, go, now, now!
no, no!
I-I can't, I can't tell if she's breathing!
I don't know if she's alive!
it was so stupid, I know.
but I was just doing what my father asked.
I was scared. We both were.
but you were at the scene when we arrived.
I just couldn't leave her there.
your instincts as a doctor took over.
Yeah.
so I returned as if I hadn't been there at all.
and I offered my help before the paramedics arrived.
and my father and I just pretended we didn't know each other.
Why? Why lie? Why trade places, Karita?
we had spent the evening at this restaurant celebrating the end of my residency.
you'd had a couple of drinks?
one glass of wine.
I swear to you, I wasn't drunk.
my father would never have let me drive.
despite that, he just couldn't take the chance.
he was afraid your prior DWI would influence the judge and ultimately your conviction.
so he claimed to be driving the car.
he didn't have much faith in the truth.
I begged him for days after just let me take responsibility for what I'd done.
but he said we were in too deep.
he still believes to this day that it was the right thing to do.
greater good, Karita, he says.
greater good!
Dano, Dano, how's Lindsay doing?
you gotta be kidding me.
is that her I hear screaming in the background?
Yeah, yeah, all right. All right, daddy.
I'll talk to you later. Take care, bud, bye.
detective Flack?
Mr. Neville.
I understand you have something that belongs to me, and I was wondering if I could get it back.
need some help?
I thought I was rid of you.
I wanted to say I'm sorry.
for what?
that I can't give you back those 18 months you spent in jail.
I would have done it again all the same if I had to.
your daughter means the world to you.
Oh, yeah.
and I'm sure Ms. Donovan felt that way about Maris.
Karita told us everything.
what was it about the truth that scared you?
the odds.
my daughter made a mistake.
DWI. One mistake.
no question she was wrong, but sometimes we're not too forgiving.
you can't tell me that taking responsibility for that accident wouldn't have chang things for her.
I wanted to preserve what I had worked for all those years.
I wanted her to succeed.
and she's doing it.
only one regret...
that this little girl lost her life that night.
so what happens to Karita now?
it was an accident, Neville.
now that we know what really happened, no DA with an ounce of common sense will prosecute that case.
greater good.
mac it's time
that's okay. That's okay. You're doing great.
you can do it, baby. Good!
breathe, breathe. - Good!
there we go! There we go! - Come on. Come on. You're doing great. You're doing great!
good job, Lindsay. Good job. Keep it up. Keep it up! - Hey, that's it, baby! That's it, sweetheart!
go ahead! Come on! - Breathe.
come on! Push one more. Push! Come on! - Here we go!
good job, good job. There she is! There she is!
way to push, Lindsay. Keep it going. Come on. Here we go... - She's beautiful.
Oh, hello. Oh, hello, sweetheart.
Oh, Danny, I hate to admit it, but she looks just like you.
Yes, that's right, she's a knockout.
how you holding up?
I'm great.
but she's gonna be an only child 'cause I am never doing that again.
do you guys have a name?
guess that's a no.
mac, we did agree on one thing.
we were hoping that you would consider being the godfather.
absolutely, yes.
made him an offer he can't refuse.
you know,"Godfather," that's code word for diaper change, you know that?
do I get to spoil her?
I think Danny's got that covered.
Oh, we forgot about the oohs and ahs.
okay, yes, yes, ready, everybody?
and...
that's nice.
so cute.
be right there.
hello.
Hello?
help us.
help us.
thank you.
our victim's name is Brooke Hallworth.
she's 21 years old.
paramedics found her unconscious, blunt force trauma to the head.
she's at Trinity Hospital.
they're taking her into surgery now.
we know if she was a guest here?
nothing registered in her name.
okay.
let's see what we've got.
this blood trail indicates she came from somewhere upstairs.
looks like the brood trail leads into the elevator.
she definitely pushed the lobby button.
all right, so how do we know what floor she came from?
only one way to find out.
police business.
here we go.
door's been left open.
Flack, we got a victim here.
I'm not catching any vitals.
Hey, Stell.
take a look at this.
looks like we can rule out robbery.
is Stella canvassing for witnesses?
she's on her way to the hospital to get an update on our female vic.
so, Mac...
luxury suite...
champagne...
cash...
ski mask.
which item doesn't belong?
what about this gunshot wound to the abdomen?
any sign of a casing?
shooter either used a revolver or took the casing with him.
this guy's all banged up.
it's consistent with defensive injuries, but the coloration suggests they were sustained over a period of time.
could be he's just clumsy.
or he's got a painful job.
Yeah.
this abrasion here is very recent.
could have happened during a struggle with the killer.
looks like there's some kind of pattern to it.
it's tough to make out.
I'll get a digital copy to AV, see if we can enhance what's there.
metal housing on the privacy chain is bent.
this door was forced open.
so, room invasion without the robbery.
one dead. One barely makes it out of here alive.
whoever did this was looking to hurt these people.
if robbery wasn't the motive, why not take the money anyway?
room's registered to a Jesse Lewis.
checked in a few hours ago with a woman matching the description of our female vic.
if she was inside this room when the ski mask came off the killer's face, she may be able to make an I. D.
if she makes it at all.
race you to the end of the hallway.
just a little humor there.
Yeah, well, uh, where are we at on this hotel room murder?
well, behind door number one, we have a silver vase, champagne bottle and all the matching stemware.
behind door number two, we have a wool ski mask, presumably worn by the killer.
so, what's it going to be, Messer?
it's going to be door number one.
feeling lucky about getting some prints, huh?
no, it's just a little closer.
when I worked as a medical intern, we'd get these kids coming in with injuries like you wouldn't believe.
hyperextended vertebrae, cranial contusions, spiral fractures.
football players?
you'd think so, but believe it or not, they were dancers.
okay. What kind of dance moves cause injuries like these?
okay, well, this stress fracture here is caused by torsional motion, most likely the result of a pretty popular dance move called an air flare.
all right, it looks like he also suffered a herniated cervical disc.
highly indicative of gradual strain and repetitive motion.
so, our vic was a dancer.
more specificay, a street dancer.
partially healed.
now, It's not from dancing, and most likely not related to our crime.
I'd say it happened within the past few months.
what about C. O.D?
Sid recover a slug?
no.
this is all he was able to remove from the wound.
some type of metallic powder.
and it wasn't a through and through.
that's odd.
Yeah.
but you can see the round only penetrated a few inches into the body, then stopped dead.
so, we have no exit wound and no bullet.
where did it go?
and what exactly is this?
any word on our victim's girlfriend, Brooke Hallworth?
Yeah, she's still in the hospital, but she's showing signs of improvement.
the minute she's conscious, I'm getting back there.
did you see the paper today?
Yeah.
Adam said he saw a quiz on Facebook called:
if you were the Compass Killer, where would you strike next?
he told me.
we're going to get this guy, Mac.
but right now, let's just focus on the hotel murder.
take a look at this.
the abrasion on our vic's neck...
it's some kind of crosshatch pattern.
took sustained force to cause that kind of impression.
it's not just a glancing blow.
and Hawkes was right about our vic's other injuries.
Jesse Lewis was a dancer.
in fact, he was performing last night just hours before he died.
I got this off the Internet.
Jesse performed under the stage name Mechanicx.
this particular competition is known as Battle Step.
I thought this type of dancing went out with Ms. Pac-Man and the Rubik's Cube.
definitely went underground and advanced, only to resurface with a new name.
it's now called street dancing, and it's gone pro.
street dancing.
what's the guy in red uptight about?
could be the fact that our vic won first place in the singles event.
ten grand. All cash.
everyone in that audience saw him win.
our suspect could have been there, followed Brooke and Lewis back to their hotel room.
strange thing is, if the prize money was the motive, then why was it still there?
why don't we ask the guy who came in second.
a broken man without a throne
you ever see this guy before?
it's Jesse Lewis.
thinks he's got skills for battling.
Yeah, we heard you two exchanged skills last night.
you came in second place.
Yeah, well, the judges must've been high or something.
why you asking me about Jesse?
he do something wrong?
Yeah.
he stepped in front of a gun while someone else was pulling the trigger.
we're thinking that someone might be you.
couldn't accept you'd lost, decided to take the battle outside to another venue.
no, that-that ain't how it went down.
then wthat matchesour wrist guard?
I'll tell you why.
you were tired of coming in second place, right?
tired of missing out on the bragging rights, sponsorships, endorsement deals.
and with Jesse in the way, none of that was ever going to be yours.
so you follow him back to the hotoom, you take him out, but you leave all the money behind knowing that if you stole it, you'd take first place on our suspect list.
and Jesse's girlfriend?
what, she just get in the way, or was there something else going on there?
we may have done some after-hours battling, but I didn't kill him.
convince me.
I spent months working on a new move.
it's called the elbow airre.
I'm getting ready to rockng the crowd with it, right?
but before I get a chance, dude comes out y owmove.
so I called him out.
yo.
you been scoping myYou busted my elw man, I .
got my own moves
step otace.
Oh, my God!
if I'm gonna kill somebody, I'll do it in the ring.
we'll see about that.
I'm Detective Stella Bonasera with the NYPD.
Weunthe man who killed Jesse.
it's very important that we get an I. D. from you.
do?
I mean, she just regained consciousness.
her memory's not all thert.
recollections from traumatic reevents are often most vivid just after regaining consciousness.
so, yes, this is standard procedure.
are you a family member?
I'm a friend of Brooke's.
Nick Emerson.
a colleague of mine is going to escort our suspect into the room, Brooke.
I need you to look at him and tell me if it's the same man that broke into your hotel room last night.
okay?
okay. I guess.
good.
tell 'em I didn't do it.
what did I tell you about talking?
I don't know.
take your time.
I'm sorry.
I honestlyon't remember.
it's okay.
Rithere, on the left.
sstantial contusion, swn.
a gde fivus.
that would explain the loss of consciousness a aia
even if she was staringus. Dot Com the fe, that memoryou wutf her brain.
lif wasn't wiped away.
if this had been a grade six concussion, we'd be investigating a double homicide.
any insight from the doctors regarding her memory loss?
Yeah.
only time will tell.
helpful.
any idea when she'll be released from the hospital?
well, her vitals are normal.
but her physician wants to keep her for observation.
he seems pretty confident that she'll be released within 24 hours.
I know it's the last place she'd want to go, but a trip back to the crime scene might spark a memo or two.
on the metallic powder from the vic's gunshot wound?
XRF indicated copper and zinc metalloid.
still trying to track down a source.
from now on I want to be called Adam Ross Dot E-D-U.
cause all day long I'm giving people education.
nothing?
ski mask.
right. Uh, I found a few hairs within the fibers but nothing with roots on it to give us DNA.
class characteristics?
same color and pigment distribution as the sample we got from Dot Com.
but it doesn't definitively say it's his.
see if we can get mitochondrial DNA.
what about surveillance footage?
nothing on our killer.
prints Danny lifted off the vase?
one belongs to Brooke Hallworth, which we expected.
but there was a second print.
no match to Brooke, Jesse, or Dot Com.
ran it through AFIS and I got nothing.
if Brooke used that vase during the struggle, chances are the other prin belongs to our killer.
run the prints through any y therprateqt identificaon civilian databases.
from their employees
what do you got, bud?
this was not the first time our vic was robbed.
Yeah, I don't think you can claim New York residency unless you've been robbed twice, no?
M. O. is practically identical.
according to the report, three months ago e wins a local dance contest.
first prize is 3, 000 clams, cash.
not a night you want to walk home.
all right, so you're thinking that this guy targeted Jesse again after he won this contest?
that makes sense.
says here they made an arrest.
Yeah.
he's number five.
picked him up trying to pawn Jesse's watch.
no hit. Jesse didn't I. D.
that's whatup trying I don't get it.
he was stariache cording to the complaint.
right, so why doesn't he identify this guy?
who is this clown?
Me...me no speaky English.
Yeah, all right, you know what?
knock it off, Alice.
it's Al. It's Al, scumbag.
al Scumbag?
I thought you said his name was Santiago.
Yeah, right here on your rap sheet.
it says your name is Alice Adrienne Santiago.
with a name like that, you probably had to mail your milk money to the school bully.
it's of German descent. means "noble.
Yeah, you're obviously living up to your name.
Yeah, yeah. You guys are funny.
so, what'd I do now?
you know what you did-- robbery, with a homicidal twist.
Yeah. Yeah, that-that sounds like me.
tell us about Jesse Lewis.
you gotta verespecifics, m.
I don't know the name of every dude that I rob.
hip-hop dancer, followed him from a club, took him for three grand.
Yeah. Yeah, that's
Oh, ye, ye, ye That guy, uh-huh.
but you see, I didn't do that because he couldn't I. D. me, remember?
Yeah, exactly. That's why you weren't gonna that's why you wore a ski mask, right?
see, now I know you definitely got the wrong guy 'cause I don't ski.
three thousand, that was a score.
but ten large - you weren't passing that up even though it was the same mark, right?
so, what happened? What went wrong?
did Jesse bum-rush you again?
he rips off your mask?
did he getYou figure you can't leave him alive to I. Dyou 'cause you're not gonna get that lucky again.
so what happens next?
somebody hears the commotion, they come in the room to intervene, they force you out of there before you can pocket the cash, huh?
first I'm gonna go on record right now and say I don't know what thhe you two idbout punk
and as for that robbery three months ago...
it must really hurt, huh?
to know you're sitting across from the dude you're so sure who did it, but there's nothing you can do about it.
but until the mitochondrial DNA from the hair in the ski maskt. comes back a match, we don't have anything that puts him in that hotel room.
methi's off, though.
based on the complaint of the first robbery, Jes
why'd the I. D.
well, you know how unreliable eyewitnesses can be.
Especihen ey're staring down the barrel of a gun.
that's it
it's the same color and consistency as the powder recovered from the vic's gunshot wound.
I made a few calls to some of my military contacts.
it turns out a copper and zinc metalloid is used in the construction of a tactical training round known as simulated ammunition.
Yeah, used for marking your shots.
but I thought all simulated ammunition was ink-filled nonlethal.
similar to paintballs.
there's actually two kinds.
the ink-filled, nonlethal type. And then there's these.
SafeFire rounds.
they're frangible.
designed to disintegrate on impact with hard targets.
so this must've cut through our vic'fl and then broke u disintegrate on p ithe underlying dense tissue, resulting in the metallic powder.
I just heard back from the SafeFire manufacturer.
our sample is a match to the impurity levels in one of the lots.
and that lot was sent to?
a weapons training facility called Center Ring Firing Range in Brooklyn.
that's where we'll find our killer.
U' dead, Frank.
well, that's what happens when you don't check yos.
you die.
only managed to kill eight innocent civilians today.
Seeveryone next week.
classes are a hundred dollars a person, no more than seven people per group.
all instructors are licensed and trained in various firearMs.
kill House.
nothing can touch it in terms of reality.
except maybe reality.
sorry.
I thought you were auditing the last class.
mind if I check out your firearm?
mind if I ask what this is about?
this.
your simulated ammunition was used to commit a murder the other night.
well, you don't think I had anything...
relax, Mr. Roberts.
I'm not accusing you of anything.
not yet, anyway.
but I do need you to explain to me how one of your rounds ended up being used in a homicide.
I have a lot of students.
I guess any one of them could've walked off with some of my practice rounds.
don't you account for all the simulated rounds distributed to the people in your class?
should I be talking to a lawyer?
do you need to?
look, every day I meet dozens of people who want to learn how to fire a gun.
I can't be held responsible for the actions of every person who comes in and out of this place.
somebody has to.
this man is dead because of one of your rounds.
is that Jesse?
you know him?
this is crazy, yeah.
Jesse was a student in one of my classes.
you think our vic was shot by his own gun?
the problem is, I don't know anyone who carries a gun for protection and loads it with practice rounds.
Hey, guys.
there's no record of our vic owning a handgun license.
but Adam got a hit from the prints lifted off the vase from the hotel room and they match prints from an employee database of a Zenith Limos.
it's a car service owned by retired police officers.
the prints belong to a Nick Emerson.
wait a second.
he was visiting Brooke in the hospital.
I'm a friend of Brooke's.
said he was a friend of hers.
he's also friends with Jesse, our male vic.
they were business partners.
Jesse would do the dancing.
Nick provided the hype.
seems that he also goes by the name of Nick "Cool.
well, it looks like it's time to talk to Nick, see how cool he really is.
you never heard of a day gig?
means I don't have time for this.
you got a lot more time than Jesse Lewis does.
according to some of your B-boy associates, you and Jesse were tight.
Yeah, we grew up together.
started a merchandising line for street dancers-- hats, T-shirts, gloves.
anyway, Jesse was my best friend.
you should've seen him, he tore up the stage.
which was all part of the plan.
Jesse would rock the crowd, become a star.
I would amp the hype, kick-start a marketing campaign using the prize money.
sorry.
can you explain your fingerprint at the crime scene.
Yeah,
earlier in the evening, after Jesse won the contest.
we all went back to the hotel to celebrate.
who's "we all"?
Jesse, Brooke and I.
I mean, the party was on.
What?!
okay!
nice, man.
all right, my man, let's see what you got.
come on, man, dancing is your thing, business is mine.
come on
let's see it, s see it.
I reached out to the table to steady myself.
my fingers must've touched the vase somehow.
how come you failed to mention earlier that you were in the room the night of the murder?
cause it looked like you guys had a suspect in custody.
seemed like it was all wrapped up.
I didn't see why it was pertinent.
you know what, I still don't.
so how did the party end?
Brooke and Jesse wanted to do a little celebrating of their own.
so I took the hint, went back to my pad.
what time was that?
you serious, man?
you want an alibi?
Jesse was my best friend.
I'll also need hair and a DNA sample.
if at any point you feelleav le you just tell me, okay?
all right, baby, check it out.
I think we deserve to have a little celebration.
start out with a little champagne.
thank you.
you're welcome, babe.
we're the best.
I remember coming back to the room.
Jesse had just won the dance battle.
we were celebrating.
we won! We won, babe!
look at it!
is is crazy.
I love you.
who was in twith you?
me and Jesse.
what about Nick?
he said that the three of you left the competition together and then came up here.
I don't think so.
Jesse, please...
Oh, my God.
what did hwant?
I don't know.
it was like...
it was like he was gonna help me...
Brooke, did you see his face?
I don't know. I can't remember.
Okayokok .
all right, you out of here. It's okay.
mac, I've gone over the evidence from the hotel room three times, and Jesse and Brooke-- they're here.
they're on the champagne bottle, the glasses.
they're on the money, but nobody else.
if Nick was partying in that room, his prints would be there, too.
Yeah. That's the thing.
unless he didn't eat, he didn't drink, basically didn't move, there's no way that he was celebrating in that hotel room the way he told us he was.
which is consistent with the little Brooke could remember during her walk-through.
Yeah, so he's lying to us.
big time.
mito DNA from the hair on the ski mask just came back.
matched the DNA from our vase fingerprint.
Nick was there.
not to party, but to kill.
and this is based on what evidence?
sometimes the absence of evidence is the best evidence of all.
we found nothing in that room indicating you were partying with Brooke and Jesse.
we did find one of your hairs on the ski mask.
the DNA matched back to your fingerprint.
no way to dance around that.
I loved Jesse, man.
everyone did.
so, you killed him.
makes perfect sense.
you have no idea how this went down.
it's not what you think.
doesn't matter what I think.
the evidence says everything.
that I did it?
okay.
okay, I killed him.
Why?
because...
Jesse asked mto dit.
it's crazy. I mean, you know...
nobody's gonna believe me.
I wouldn't believe me.
but you got to understand, I'm-I'm telling you the truth.
and it all started with that first robb
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.
we read the poli
I. D. the robber.
but you see, I didn't do that, because he couldn't I. D. me, remember?
what you don't know is, Brooke was with Jesse in that alley that night.
she was there.
that's the part he left out.
why would Jesse lie about her being there?
Brooke was pretty shaken up by it, so Jesse told her to go home.
said he was gonna handle everything with the police.
why didn't Jesse I. D. the robber?
cause he was embarrassed about the way he handled himself.
he thought he should have done something, tried to rescue her somehow.
my man, up against the wall.
you, too. Up against the wall.
say one word, I'm gonna shoot you both in the back of the head, you understand me?
Yeah. That's what I'm talking about.
eyes straight ahead, Romeo.
don't even think about going hero on me.
he was convinced that Brooke didn't see him the same way anymore.
you know, I told him he was crazy.
I mean, the robber had a gun.
he could have killed 'em both.
but Jesse blamed himself...for not being able to protect her.
it was like he couldn't live with it anymore.
so Jesse came up with this plan to redeem himself in your eyes.
you're telling me he planned the whole thing?
you're wrong.
he would never do anything like that.
he wanted there to be another robbery, another chance to protect you, to be your hero.
Hey, pour me some more champagne.
just tell us what you want.
shut up!
in the corner-- both of you!
now!
anything you want.
look, just don't hurt her.
here, here. I have money. Take it.
there's more over there.
Iagainst the wall to make it seem real.
hurt
but I saw him get shot.
he told me that the ammunition was safe.
simulated rounds.
that's what he called them.
and that was Jesse's fatal mistake.
he gave you those rounds without realizing they could be lethal.
that's when things went from bad to worse.
Oh, my God.
when Brooke saw my face, she could I. D. me.
I just panicked.
I never meant to hurt her or Jesse.
that explains why he knelt down to check on you, see if you were okay.
I just can't believe it was Nick under that mask.
he was our friend.
he came to visit me in the hospital.
he was going to go to the police to confess, but before he did, he wanted to see you to try to explain, to apologize as best he could.
but when he walked into your hospital room...
he realized I didn't remember anything.
he thought the whole thing would just go away.
Jesse didn't need to do any of this.
I loved him for who he was.
God... he could make me smile.
um, Brooke, I have one last thing to ask of you.
all the way to this end line.
that's him.
number three.
number three, step forward.
everyone else can go.
put your hands behind your back.
we got him, Brooke.
it's over.
someone help me, please.
my daughter's missing.
what have we got so far?
the dump site's this way.
body parts were dumped, animal scavengers dispersed them.
you cut her up in pieces, like livestock!
zeta's run like a major company now, gentlemen.
and you know what the great thing is for you guys?
you can't touch them.
I told you to make it quick.
help me. he's going to kill me
it's not going to end in Mia, is it?
no, it's not.
he's there, isn't he?
who he? What, who are you talking about?
you know what? I swear to God, you're not coming over here.
I'm coming over whether you liket .
Oh, no, you're not. You are drunk! ?
that's right, I'm calling the cops right now.
you are drunk and I...
I want to see my daughters.
you can't see your daughters like that!
shut up!
shut the hell up or I'm gonna come back there, so help me God!
Dean, you know what? I'm calling the cops right now and they're gonna put your ass in jail.
the driver of the car's name was Dean Rovin.
he was 35 years old.
according to the first on scene, he was killed on impact.
M. E.'s just hauled the body out of here.
looks like he had a few for the road.
this was actually Dean's third and last D. U.I.
so this is a traffic accident.
and we're here because...
not gonna call you all the way out here for a 10-99.
I got my Mac on this morning.
Oh, is that anything like Spidey senses?
way more powerful.
take a look at those skid marks.
looks like the driver of this rig lost control and jumped the median.
and
I can see doing that if you were And driving under the influence.
sure.
or if you recently committed murder.
if not for that accident, we may never have found her.
looks like this is the end of the road for her.
and the beginning for us.
Rigor's already on its way out.
so we're looking at a T. O.D. between 36 and 48 hours.
what do you make of the skin tone?
looks blanched, indicating extreme loss of blood.
but there's no blood at the bottom of the drum.
so if she bled out, she was put in here after she died.
so why go to all that trouble?
I mean, our driver could have dumped the body anywhere.
maybe he had a choice spot picked out, but had to get her there first.
figured he'd hide the body in this shipping drum until then.
there is a-a weigh station about 30 miles back.
I imagine he didn't want the body discovered during an inspection.
Yeah, that makes sense.
listen, when you're done here, let's get her over to Sid in situ.
this way, we can minimize any artifactual trauma to the body or loss of trace evidence.
you got it.
Hey, Joe, let's go.
we're gonna take the drum intact to the M. E.'s office.
what are you thinking?
besides the fact that you and I have never had a honeymoon,
I'm thinking that might be blood.
let's find out.
looks like our trucker was injured in the accident.
or maybe his passenger.
Oh, my God.
Yeah.
well, you can forget about catching a break on this one.
truck was a commercial lease out of Charlottesville, North Carolina.
and the ID on the paperwork came back as phony.
so we have no idea who we're chasing.
you're gonna want to come see this.
portable outhouse.
our truck driver was holding someone in here.
we found a lockbox under the driver's seat.
a few rounds from a . 45 were in there but no gun.
we have to assume he took it with him. What else we got?
I found hair in the sleeper and in the cab.
judging from the length, I'd say the donor's female.
so our victim could have been in here before she was killed and then put in the drum.
unless we're looking at a second female donor.
whoever it was, they were a prisoner.
we got multiple locks on the outside of the door but nothing to unlock it from the inside.
also explains the artwork on the walls.
you find biologicals?
no, no. I-I hit it with a light.
no signs of sexual assault.
door's damaged.
Yeah, but it doesn't look like it was from the crash.
could have been what caused the accident.
but there's no body.
there's no major blood staining.
there's no obvious signs of trauma.
there's nothing to indicate that she didn't survive the crash.
I'd call that lucky.
not if she's still with the driver.
turns out, I wasn't the first person to cut into this girl.
you found evidence of sharp force trauma?
that's your C. O.D.
exsanguination due to surgical transection of all major blood vessels supplying the liver.
you're saying someone removed her liver?
that's right.
and a microscopic immunohistochemical test indicated her body released histamine in an immunological response to the injury.
so she was alive when it happened.
and died as a result of the harvesting.
based on the precision of the work,
I can only conclude that whoever did this had a long-term plan for the organ.
possibly to sell it on the black market.
there doesn't seem to be anything else missing.
everything's here but the liver.
what about an I. D.?
nothing so far.
I se prints up to the lab. gured they could run a re cprensiveearch.
U' her liver into someone else, we don't have much time.
I already had her blood typed for surface protein markers She's AB positive.
that's an unusual blood type.
finding a liver donor would be difficult.
let's get the word out to our CI's familiar with this type of black market, and every hospital in the area.
I want a list of any patients capable of receiving an AB positive liver.
if we can I. D. who that liver was intended for, we'll be one step closer to catching our suspect.
that's great.
let me know.
got a hit on AFIS on those prints I fted off the stheel - nice
trucker's nam.
he did a nickel in Atlanta on a robbery-assault conviction.
the only trouble is, he's a parole absconder.
no permanent address, so it's gonna be hard to find him.
maybe not. That was Flack.
we got an eyewitness.
Yeah, that's him.
Mr. Winston, you sure that's the guy who carjacked you?
Yeah.
I don'wat thking.
I should have just minded my own business and kept on driving.
you okay?
relax, man, Look, I don't want any trouble.
it's too late for that.
then what happened?
he pulled this woman out of his truck, puts her in the backseat of my car.
can you describe her?
dark hair, mid-20's.
she was as scared as I was.
drive.
about ten miles down the road, he tells me to pull over out in the middle of nowhere and get out of the car.
then he orders me to give him my cell phone and wallet.
come on.
I won't tell anyone about this. I promise.
I know.
if it wasn't for that motorist who happened to drive by seconds later, I'd be dead.
he's an animal.
God help the woman that's with him.
put an alert out on Mr. Winston's car, plastic and his cell phone.
let's hope Casey Steele tries to use them.
mac, I think I know who Casey Steele's prisoner is.
her name is Madeline Briggs.
when I ran the prints and the DNA I lifted off the jug I found in the sleeper compartment,
I got a hit to a missing girl out of Miami.
her mother filed the claim five days ago.
so we have to assume Steele picked her up in Miami.
then drove her up to New York, keeping her locked up as a prisoner.
any results on the urine workup?
her analysis revealed traces of the sedative propofol.
I'm thinking that's what he used to keep her under control.
but the accident tells us that didn't keep her from fighting back.
that's because she's fighting for two.
Madeline's pregnant?
Yeah. Her urine analysis also revealed traces of human chorionic gonadotropin. HCG.
boss, we ran the rest of those prints that we lifted from the sleeper cab.
Madeline Briggs, right?
she was there, too.
what do you mean?
I found evidence of more than one woman in that sleeper.
how many?
a lot.
when I realized I had multiple donors, I ran the prints through every database that I knew of.
I got these in through NAMUS-- National Missing and Unidentified Persons System.
this one's from Florida, North Carolina, Philadelphia, Atlanta.
these girls are from every state.
and all of them at one time or another were in Casey Steele's truck.
that's our Jane Doe.
this one right here? - Yeah.
Savannah, Georgia.
I've got a Dr. Ray Langston holding on a vid call.
he's a CSI from Vegas.
he's working a case in conjunction with Miami PD.
says that he picked up one of our entries and has some information on Madeline Briggs.
I understand you have our missing girl in your city?
if we do, it might not be for long.
the man who abducted her, Casey Steele, stole a car after his truck was sidelined in a traffic accident.
we have alerts out and roadblocks set up, but so far we haven't found the car.
well, that's good-- he might still be in New York.
what can you tell us about Madeline Briggs?
lieutenant Horatio Caine and I just wrapped up two murders here in the Miami area.
during the investigation, a young woman named Madeline Briggs came across our radar, first as a suspect; now we have reason to believe she's a victim.
we found this note in a truck stop restroom in Orlando.
the last person seen with Madeline Briggs is a small-time hustler named Goodman, Tyler Goodman.
where is he now?
in a morgue in Northern Florida.
48 hours ago, Tyler was found shot to death in the bathroom of a truck stop near Jacksonville.
kill was clean; it was a pro job.
so Tyler hands off Madeline to Casey and then gets paid with a bullet.
you have ballistics on that shooting?
we do-- weapon's a . 45.
I'm sending you our ballistics evidence right now-- see if it matches up.
we have a witness, a gunshot victim Casey pulled the trigger on.
the slug was too deformed to get caliber determination, but we have reason to believe that it might be a . 45.
Yep, it's a match.
looks like Casey's been a busy boy.
the Zetas run a tight ship, and they do not tolerate mistakes.
bad news for a small-time player like Tyler.
it means he was expendable.
what else do we know about these perps?
targets are always young women between the ages of 19 and 25.
they're highly organized, they're well financed.
they lure these women into...prostitution, black-market surrogacy, use them as human-trafficking pawns, you name it.
and now harvesting bodies for organs.
makes them extremely dangerous.
detective Taylor, I have chased one victim from Vegas to Miami, only to find her dead.
when Madeline Briggs's mother reported her missing, she asked for my help, so I'm not going home until I find her daughter.
and when can I expect you?
I'm on the first thing smokin'.
detective Taylor.
welcome to New York.
Thanks.
federal marshals are escorting an inmate in a transfer from Bedford Maximum Facility to Bayview.
we made a deal in exchange for information.
we're meeting them in half an hour.
any connection to Casey Steele?
not directly.
our informant is a cell mate of a suspect we convicted six months ago in connection with a human trafficking ring here in New York City.
a little cell mate chitchat, and a convict looking to make a deal-- that's hard to trust.
true, but right now, we're standing here with nothing.
and I kind of got the impression you weren't here to sight-see.
human cargo"-- that's how Carolyn described it.
young women get moved from one state to another, truck stop to truck stop.
different drivers, different destinations.
a 24/7 operation, mostly traveling at night.
pretty impressive enterprise, if you ask me.
I always thought an 18-wheeler advertising fresh produce was really carrying vegetables.
how many do they transport? One, two, more?
doesn't matter.
these guys make more money transporting one girl than they do hauling apples across the interstate in a year.
Carolyn mention any names?
like the Zetas out of Miami?
come on, you're talking about a network with dozens of truckers.
was Casey Steele one of them?
maybe.
look, I wasn't taking notes.
all right, what about the girls?
what happens to them?
everything.
sex slaves, surrogates, organ donors-- and if they survive the surgery, it starts all over.
and it's the truck driver's job to keep the payload-- the girls-- alive and healthy.
they don't get paid if the cargo arrives dead.
the more use you get out of one girl, the more money you make.
that means Madeline could still be alive.
unless she's trouble.
that's when they become body parts, scattered from coast to coast.
excuse me.
a lot of World WarI hero with their names on these walls.
too many.
my father fought in the Korean War.
I understand you w some stres yourself.
I just wanted to be like my father.
mac, I've seen what they do to these young women, and it's... body parts strewn by the highway, left like food for wild animals.
now, you said Madeline put up a fight.
you said there was evidence of that in the truck.
that doesn't mean she's not alive, Ray.
she's pregnant.
the child she's carrying is worth a lot to these guys.
my bet, Casey's gonna make sure she makes it to her destination.
are you going to use that phone?
I have to make a very difficult phone call to Madeline Briggs' mother.
who's probably pacing up and down and checking voice messages, wondering what the hell I've discovered, if I've found her daughter.
a case when no news is good news is no consolation.
you have kids?
no.
me neither.
I suppose we both spared ourselves the stress of this nightmare.
I don't know you well, Ray, but you don't look so stress-free to me.
it never gets easier, does it?
no.
I've told parents about their dead or missing kids more times than I can count.
hell, the first time, was one time too many.
one day, a woman whispers "thank you" to me through her tears.
and I realized that she just needed to know that there was somebody doing everything they could for her child.
and that's what you're doing, Ray.
and that's worth a phone call.
let's go get this guy, Mac.
I ran an organ recipient search with the national donor list.
a patient awaiting a liver, blood type AB positive, withdrew from the list yesterday.
he could have died, waiting.
thought of that.
he's still alive.
and liver disease isn't something that just goes away.
so you're thinking he's forgoing the national donor process and getting an organ off the black market?
possibly the liver from our victim in the back of the truck.
a Manhattan clinic requested 50 pints of AB positive blood for prep of a liver transplant.
that blood was delivered this morning.
you don't have authorization to go in there.
this ought to do it.
Dr. Fuller is about to begin surgery.
Dr. Fuller.
I got a couple questions to ask you.
detective, I imagine you're here about a liver.
it's there in that cooler.
but there's also a man in there waiting for it.
so you can arrest me anh'll.
or you can let me go in there and save his life.
I'll be waiting for you.
I make a phone call.
every time to the same number?
Yes. Again.
same number every time.
I tell them what I need. I don't know how or who does it.
a cooler is left for me at the clinic.
is this the man that delivers the coolers?
I told you, I don't see faces.
they're just voices on a phone.
you must pay them?
cash. In an envelope.
a different post office box every time.
okay so what's the going rate for a liver, Dr. Fuller?
depends.
depends on whether your patients are desperate or not?
the closer they are to death the more they'll pay, or is it the more you'll charge?
I don't set the price.
no, only for yourself, right?
so tell me, Doctor, how much do you get paid for turning a blind eye to the Hippocratic Oath?
no, look at me.
I said, look at me.
the liver you transplanted today belonged to a healthy young woman who died to fill your pockets.
her name-- Debbie Menzel.
and there are dozens more just like her.
their organs are being harvested in motel bathrooms and makeshift operating rooMs.
young girls who are butchered and dumped on the side of the road.
and you agreed to the oath, doctor, the covenant.
I will keep them from harm and injustice.
do you remember saying those words?
you stupid, greedy son of a bitch.
I swear, I've never seen him before.
it's like I told you, I make a phone call...
Yeah, all right.
okay.
write that phone number down, Mr. Fuller.
finding Madeline Briggs hasn't gotten any easier.
so we try harder.
the phone number Flack got from the doctor had to give us something.
Yeah, we're identifying all the calls made to that number over the last month.
most of them are doctors.
we'll bring 'em in, show them Casey Steele's mug, I'll see what I can get out of them.
they're not going to know him.
he's a driver. Driver's stay on the interstate and keep moving.
it appears that one particular part of this business doesn't mingle with another.
protects them from knowing too much -
from being able to identify anyone else in the bigger organization.
well, we have managed to identify one player-- Casey Steele.
from everything we know about him, he's not a one-man operation.
if he's as connected as we think he is, somebody's going to help him very soon.
until then, he has to take care of a pregnant young woman.
right.
the witness that Flack talked to didn't mention that she was pregnt.
which means, Madeline could still be in her first trimester with at least six months left in her pregnancy.
still able to turn a few more tricks before she begins to show.
right. All for the purpose of continuing their cash flow.
for them, it's just a business.
right now, Madeline is a duel revenue stream for them.
unfortunately, the demand is there.
if it's not forced surrogacy, it's prostitution, body parts, blood, eggs, hair, even bone marrow has a price.
a lung or a kidney can sell for $100, 000 on the black market.
boss, I just got a real-time hit on Joseph Winston's stolen phone.
we were waiting for our suspect to turn it on.
triangulation traced it to a pharmacy on Riverside Drive.
and I just tapped into their security caMs.
well, and that's him, that's Casey Steele.
what's he waiting for?
Lindsay, call the pharmacy. Tell them to take their times.
Danny, call Hawkes and Flack. They're going shopping.
let's go.
there's our guy.
you think?
let's go.
Hey, look out, look out!
Freeze!
I got him, I got him!
head around the back.
stop!
locked!
I lost him!
well, he couldn't have tten far. He's not that fast.
guys, keep that side of the building covered. He may be coming toward you.
ye, got it.
are u l right?
Yeah.
see if they see anything around back.
you got it.
Hey, we got every available patrol looking for this guy, but he knows it now.
according to the pharmacist, Casey was waiting on a script for Diprivan to be filled.
it's also known as propofol. It's a sedative.
now the evidence we collected from Casey's truck indicates that he was injecting Madeline with it.
which confirms what we were thinking-- that Madeline's still alive.
detective Flack.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah?
we're on our way.
a couple of my boys found the car Casey stole parked around the corner.
you think she's in there?
the trunk looks open.
okay.
if Casey went to the pharmacy alone, then where's Madeline?
clearly not here.
let's just hope there's something in this car that'll point us in the right direction.
What'd you find?
got some fresh soil evidence on the brake pedal.
maybe we can match it to a reference sample.
get a location where our driver's been.
boom. I got a match.
where? - Corona?
there's nothing in that area but a half a dozen junkyards.
we'll start with Corona Scrap.
that's where you got your reference sample from.
I'm gonna go call Mac.
doc.
can I offer you a party favor?
I'm gonna have to pass.
it's the price of admission, Ray.
Casey Steele's a shooter-- I can't risk you going in unarmed.
all right.
did you know that the, uh, oldest projectile fired from a weapon was recorded in the fourth century in Japan?
it was fired from a very crude handheld cannon that you lit with a wick.
its sole purpose was for taking life.
seems that after 1, 700 years of evolution...
we haven't come very far, have we?
all right.
everyone knows the tac plan.
the target is armed and dangerous.
I want ESU all over the playing field on this.
tight perimeter.
got air support on the way, but there are too many moving parts.
so we got to move now.
remember, we have an innocent in the mix.
one female, Madeline Briggs.
if this goes bad, she's a hostage. If it goes worse, she's collateral.
that means everyone stays hot, unless he decides to use her.
now let's move.
move, move, move!
she was here.
Hey, freeze!
Flack, man down!
I got him, I got him.
I got you, guy, I got you! Stay down.
I'm gonna keep pressure on. Stay down. Stay with me.
look at me. Look at me!
it's over.
you move, and I'll put a hole in you.
drop the weapon!
put the gun down!
get up.
where is she?
Where's Madeline?
where is she?
she's gone.
what do you mean, she's gone?
poof.
get him out.
come on, let's go.
just relax.
we checked your cell phone, Casey.
you made repeated calls to the same mobile number, one right after the accident, the rest in the last 12 hours.
we're gonna track down the person on the other end of that call.
good luck.
I understand, Casey-- you're not afraid.
so listen to me and listen very carefully.
it's still not too late to make a deal.
Oh, is that right?
that's right.
I give you my word I'll do everything in my power to make sure everyone involved in this knows that you cooperated with us.
that kind of advertisement will put me in the morgue.
who's the new transporter?
who did you hand her off to?
ere are they taking Madeline?
if you two gentlemen don't have any more questions for me, I think I'd like to go to jail now.
take a look.
where are they?
you don't seriously expect me to remember them all, do you?
I said, take another look.
I think that one's in Salt Lake City.
and Denver.
get him out of here.
I'm so sorry.
I'll call you as soon as I know something.
Madeline's mother.
she's convinced her daughter's dead, and there's nothing I can say to offer her... any kind of hope.
you're gonna find her, Ray.
you're gonna find her.
welcome back, Mrs. Krell.
I told you, it's Martha.
your room's ready and I have your credit card on file.
see you in the morning. I'm beat.
clerk: Call me if you need anything, Martha.
decedent's name is Martha Krell. Flight attendant.
she checked in this afternoon.
apparently, she was stabbed to death.
the coroner's en route.
weird... no sign of struggle.
no clothes, no luggage.
Sara: Bedspread's undisturbed.
trashcan is empty and the inside is spotless.
it's possible a liner's been removed.
take a whiff.
smells clean.
smells like a hospital.
bleaches and deodorizers.
killer attacked the victim, then cleaned and sanitized the room.
Ah, but here's the smell of the blood still, and all the perfumes in Arabia will not sweeten this little room.
who... are you?
who, who, who, who?
who... are you?
who, who, who, who?
I really wanna know. Who... are you?
Oh-oh-oh. Who...
come on, tell me who are you, you, you. Oh, you!
her liver temp's 83 degrees.
she's been dead approximately ten hours.
I'd like to get a clear photo of her wounds.
can we lay her out?
Oh, yeah. Grab her feet.
defensive wounds.
incised.
at least a dozen.
she did not want to die.
I just got the call.
Where's Grissom?
bathroom.
working the, uh, case.
Hey.
hand me my multi-tool, will ya, Greg?
I need a Phillips.
what are you doing?
well, the stabbing was brutal, but the crime scene is clean.
no cast-off, no spatter.
so, I want to know if the killer washed blood down the drain.
swab and phenol this, will ya?
blood.
label it. Send it to DNA.
usually in hotel rooms, we find too many prints.
not a single one.
just wipes and swipes.
ms. Krell was a real nice lady.
she brought me a Dodger baseball cap.
Wow. So you were friends?
not really.
airlines buy a chunk of rooms for their trolley dollies, discounted.
she's been staying here for a few months.
so you discovered the body.
her supervisor called to say her A. M. flight was canceled.
she wasn't answering her phone.
he asked me to make sure she got the message.
so you knocked on her door, and when she didn't answer, you just went right in?
Yeah. I got a master key.
Yeah, I knew that.
does the hotel have surveillance?
Nope.
thank you. You've been a big help.
right on.
excuse me. I'm Hayden Michaels.
I'm the manager of the Four Aces.
I just got the call.
anything we can do to help?
thank you. I'll let you know.
detective, if this hits the media, this is really going to hurt our business.
what are you asking me?
anything you can do to keep it out of the press?
look, I'm trying to catch a killer.
I got no control over the press.
if this makes the news, then it is what it is.
Hey. Victim's in the bedroom.
ty Hawkins, 12.
mother came in to wake him...
found him like this.
beaten to death.
this many blows, it was personal.
liver temp makes T.O.D. around midnight.
no sign of forced entry.
nothing's missing.
all the doors and windows were locked except for the screen door.
parents claim they keep that locked.
you find a weapon?
negative.
family's been transported down to the station.
I'm gonna go down and take their statement.
Hey, when you're done here, roll by. We'll ink them.
you got it.
boy's not even safe in his own bed.
I'll take the inside.
Yeah, I could use the fresh air.
found a pile of pipes by the side of the house
one seems to be missing.
this is an exemplar of a possible murder weapon.
and I cast a shoe impression just outside the kid's bedroom window.
also some graffiti.
maybe somebody had it in for the kid.
well, I bagged the bloody sheets from the bed.
found boxers, a T-shirt and a fitted sheet in the washer.
Mm. Well, whoever killed the boy knew how to get in and out of this house without waking the family.
no mystery here.
ms. Krell was violently stabbed to death.
C.O.D. exsanguination.
SAE kit?
she was raped.
contusions to the vaginal introitus and an eighth-inch hemorrhagic laceration at the vaginal fourchette.
6: 00 position. The attack was brutal.
aren't they always?
I don't know why people think that rape has anything to do with sex.
if a guy just wants sex, he can hire a hooker.
what else?
well, there is some good news.
motile sperm in the wet mount.
I've sent the kit to DNA for analysis.
Ecklie, what's up?
I paged Grissom.
and he paged me.
how can I help you?
five years ago, there was this, uh, day-shift case,
homicide. The victim was a flight attendant named Sue Stein from Palo Alto, California.
she was raped and murdered in a local hotel.
killer was never apprehended.
vic's clothing and suitcase were missing.
room was immaculate, smelled like disinfectant.
same signature.
one difference.
in the prior case, body was found in a first floor room.
sliding glass door facing the pool was unlocked.
ms. Krell was killed on the second floor.
there was only one way into her room.
was there semen present in Sue Stein's SAE kit?
Yeah. Ran it through CODIS. No hit.
I asked Mia to compare it with the semen from the recent attack.
is that fingerprint from your crime scene?
only print we found. Impressed in Sue's blood on the bedspread near her hips.
underlying pattern on the fabric made it impossible to read.
that was then.
this is now.
my son's dead. Why are you fingerprinting me?
the crime lab is going to dust your house for prints, so I need to know which ones are yours.
now, your wife said that you both went to bed after the news.
I already told you that.
twice.
you know, I... I got questions, too, you know.
why Ty?
why not me?
how could my wife and I sleep through it all?
Mr. Hawkins, would you stand up, facing me, so I can take some photos?
is this really necessary?
please, just let him do his job.
sir...
open up.
I'll be needing to take your shoes.
you can wear some booties home.
what now?
you and your wife are free to go.
what about Matt?
he has to stay here in protective custody until this is resolved.
Hey.
they're keeping Matt.
I know. He'll be home soon.
it's just procedure.
right? Right.
can we at least...
can't allow that.
come on, let-let's go.
come on.
you just gonna let them go?
neither has a record, no motive.
there's no blood on them.
well, they could've showered, tossed their clothes.
their grief is not an act.
Yeah, based on what?
years of listening to the parents of dead children.
let's go talk to this kid.
Hey, Mia.
let me guess, you're listening to something classy like Jessica or Ashlee.
it's... Jean-Paul Sartre.
no Exit.
it loses something in a translation.
Oui, oui.
the blood from the hairy wad that you found in the drain is consistent with the victim.
and what about the semen from Martha's SAE?
that's consistent with the DNA from the first attack.
you are looking at the same rapist.
I want to show you something.
Really?
this guy's immune system doesn't recognize his own sperm.
antibodies are attacking the little guys.
I read about this phenomenon in a forensic journal...
november, 2003.
killer had a vasectomy, then had it reversed.
Oui, oui.
Thanks, Mia.
how could a boy have made someone so mad?
cod is blunt-force trauma.
I counted 14 separate blows.
several more were coinciding.
