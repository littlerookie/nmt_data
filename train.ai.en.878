do you think Scott raped one of them?
no.
none of them is exhibiting any fear.
it could have been someone who was transferred, or-or killed in combat.
Hey. I thought we were done with this case.
no. It's possible
sergeant Scott raped someone who used to be in the platoon.
your buccinator's playing up again.
it's not...
I didn't say... Oh. Oh, look.
now you're embarrassed.
well, you have every reason to be.
you did get it wrong, didn't you? I mean,
sergeant Scott didn't rape Sheila Lake. Cal...
what? She's the one making snide comments. Look at her face.
how do people work here?
sergeant Scott redeploys within 24 hours.
I want you to get ahold of military personnel.
I want the historic roster for the platoon right away.
got it.
what?
Oh, what, now you're starting on me?
don't say something you'll regret. And I saw that.
can I have a muffin?
Ah, no. No, no, no, you don't want the muffins here.
they are terrible. They taste like sofa cushions covered with the moldy nuts your grandmother used to keep in that old jar on her... Oh. Okay, okay.
between you and Lightman, a girl could starve.
do you have something for me? Yeah, um...
I've been watching tape of Earl trying to understand what's behind the anger.
uh, nothing so far, but I did come up with this expression.
I've been through the facial coding book, and there's elements of AU-four and AU-five.
but it's not anger. No.
it's not.
can we pull up full stats for Earl over the year?
sure.
what emotion is it?
it's not an emotion.
this is entirely unexpected.
you know, for a CEO, this guy's a terrible liar.
you talk to personnel at Fort Meade?
none of the women in the 23rd died in combat, but there's one who went AWOL.
Rebecca Metz was on the 23rd's roster in Afghanistan.
went AWOL four months ago, shortly after her transfer request was denied.
she tried to transfer out of her platoon?
Mm. That's not all.
here's a copy of the anonymous harassment report on Sergeant Scott.
handwriting's the same.
they have any idea where she is?
no, but the number of AWOL soldiers has doubled since we invaded Iraq.
I doubt they got the manpower to play that much hide-and-seek.
well, she's got relatives in Baltimore, right?
Yeah.
hate to miss a family reunion.
Hello?
uh, what can I do for you?
looking for your granddaughter, Rebecca Metz?
she's not here.
sounds good.
you mind if I borrow this?
what? Where are you going?
help!
help!
grandpa?
grand...
help.
Sheila admitted she was lying, but she said she was trying to protect the platoon.
I don't know what this has to do with me.
light: Sheila didn't make everything up.
we know why you went AWOL.
we're not here for the army.
we just want to know what happened.
I, uh... never had a problem with Sergeant Scott in the States.
he wasn't loud or gross like the other guys.
but... But on our first day in Afghanistan, after curfew, he came in my tent.
he raped you?
the sergeant's in charge.
he's supposed to have your back.
my job is to say yes.
Yes, sir.
it happened more than once?
almost every night over there... for months.
I couldn't take it anymore.
when we got back, I just...
you ran.
light: You need to come with us.
your platoon redeploys tomorrow.
you can't let the army send those women back to Afghanistan with Sergeant Scott.
I can't go back. Well, what about Sheila? She lied for you.
I... I can't.
Rebecca... No. I...
light: Okay.
okay then.
sorry to barge in.
what are you doing?
I'm going back to the base.
but...
okay.
how did...? Sir, turn around.
did they follow us here?
Oh, no. I called them.
leave me alone.
Rebecca... I know you called the MPs.
light: Well, I had hoped you'd talk, but, yeah, I had them standing by.
Rebecca, if you explain to us... Don't you get it?
do you have any idea what it's like to be a woman in the military?
you're either a bitch or a whore.
and they're just waiting for you to fail, to admit you can't hack it.
well, then, go to jail.
that'll show 'em.
be all you can be.
you're scared.
you are still scared of Sergeant Scott.
I'm not afraid of him.
you're afraid of something.
I'm afraid they won't believe me.
Ah, it doesn't matter if they believe you.
they'll believe me.
call me later? Catch a movie?
here you go.
all right.
Hey, Earl.
thanks for taking the time.
by the way, I'm a big fan.
would you mind? Oh, no problem.
bet this'll be worth a lot some day.
Oh, yeah.
autographs, shoes, bobble heads.
pro ball is big business.
see the chin thrust?
what? You thrust your chin out.
that's a sign of anger.
you do it whenever you talk about your pro career.
I think it's 'cause you're angry you're not gonna have one.
Hey, Earl, catch.
we've seen that before, too.
you make that face almost every time you catch a pass these days.
it's intensity. No, actually, it's pain.
doctors call it the primal face of pain.
it's universal.
so what is it, Earl?
carpal tunnel?
arthritis?
look, you know how many hours I've spent shooting free throws?
I've busted my ass on the court since I was nine.
I'm raising my brother, trying to pay the rent
a big pro contract was gonna change all that.
but you know who drafts someone with erosive arthritis?
nobody.
so you took the bribe. Look,
I could've gone pro out of high school, but the Athletic Association needs its big tournament, so I gotta spend my last good year playing college ball for nothing.
look, Mr. Taft's check was the only payday I was gonna get.
you telling me you wouldn't have taken that money?
I told the post commander this matter was settled.
sergeant Scott is vital to our efforts.
he's supposed to be on a plane at 01:00 hours.
I guess if the army's going to jeopardize the safety of women, it should be done on time, right?
private Metz was AWOL for five months.
you're sure her allegation has merit?
I'm telling you she's not lying.
sergeant Scott.
I'm convening an Article 32 court-martial hearing next week.
unpack your gear, son. Major Harris, my client would like to avoid any unnecessary delay.
he wants to plead out?
our mission on the Pakistani border is critical to our safety here at home and I have a responsibility to my platoon.
so, yes, I'm ready to plead guilty to fraternization.
fraternization?
sergeant Scott had a consensual relationship with Private Metz.
Becky was my girlfriend, sir.
this photo was taken during the period when my client was allegedly raping Private Metz.
do you have others like this?
we have several, Major.
you still want to tell me she's not lying?
isolate Rebecca Metz.
there's something not right about her smile.
she doesn't look happy.
push in on her eyes.
brows up, pulled together.
she's scared.
Hi.
Yeah, it's a masking smile.
she's smiling but her eyes say she's afraid.
very afraid.
will you pull up the masking smiles? Yeah.
miss South Carolina can't show fear to the judges;
Sarah Palin has the same problem with the press.
Rebecca Metz with her platoon leader.
right, she doesn't want to be involved with Sergeant Scott, but he's her commander, she's got to do what he says.
he wants sex, right?
she feels forced to give it to him.
she can't say no.
it's nonconsensual. It's rape.
army psychologists have reported several recent cases like this.
they're calling it command rape.
it's comparable to sexual harassment, but much more extreme.
when your boss makes advances, you're scared of losing your job.
but if it's your platoon leader, you're scared of losing your life.
sergeant Scott redeploys tonight, we have to get back to Fort Meade.
they won't believe it was rape.
sergeant Scott never raised a hand.
it doesn't matter that he didn't attack you physically.
you were coerced.
no one's going to see it that way.
I never actually said no.
he was responsible for your safety.
you had to feel threatened.
I was terrified.
everyone knew if you crossed him, he'd make you drive lead.
drive lead?
lead truck in the convoy.
it's the most vulnerable to a roadside bomb.
I had a friend die that way.
I knew from the first time he came into my tent that if I said no, I'd be driving lead for a month.
so you just took it.
you never said no?
well, that's what you'll tell Major Harris.
he'll never believe me. Sure he will.
we'll put you on a polygraph.
they love them over there.
he'll never say it that way.
sergeant Scott never made me drive lead.
and he'll never admit he would have.
she's right. We still don't have any proof that he was tying her safety to sex.
the truth isn't good enough for these people.
who said anything about the truth?
is your name Rebecca Metz?
Yes.
and are you a private first class with the 23rd Mountain Division?
Yes.
did you have a relationship with Staff Sergeant Russell Scott?
no.
private Metz, let me rephrase.
were you physically involved with Staff Sergeant Scott when you serving in Afghanistan?
Yes.
he forced me to have sex with him.
we had a relationship!
he ordered you to have sex with him?
no.
but he was my commanding officer,
I didn't have a choice.
did you ever refuse to have sex with Sergeant Scott?
yes... once.
he forced me to drive lead convoy for a week.
that's a lie.
if she's lying, it graphs above the red bar here? So you're submitting that...
that's right.
machine says it's true.
well, it's not true!
the polygraph says it is.
I don't care what the machine says.
she's making it up. I never made her drive lead!
you never made her drive lead?
No! I thought that duty rotates. You never made her drive lead?
I-I never made her drive lead! It's a lie!
sergeant, you don't have to respond. So, as long she was in a relationship with you, she never had to drive lead.
is that right? Sergeant Scott...
is that right, Sergeant Scott?
sergeant Scott, don't...
is that right, Sergeant Scott?
you don't have to respond. Yeah!
Yeah, that's right.
what?
what?
well, her safety was in your charge.
you traded her safety for sex.
major Harris, my client doesn't understand...
Yes, he does.
what he did wasn't fraternization.
it was rape.
arrest him under Article 120.
you don't know what the hell you're talking about.
I'm a decorated soldier!
I didn't do anything wrong!
Yeah, it sounds good.
what do you want, huh?
I'm already suspended, they're taking away my scholarship, you hung me out.
you're the one who took the bribe.
look, the system's broken, Earl.
and what am I supposed to do, huh?
how am I supposed to take care of my brother?
I heard you did pretty well on your Econ midterm.
so? You want a degree.
so I convinced Dr. Lightman to put our fee into a trust.
probably not enough for four years at Carver, but it'll get you through Maryland.
what if I don't want your money?
then throw it away.
it's your call.
how did she do it?
we both know Metz was lying about driving lead convoy.
how did she beat the polygraph?
valium?
Yeah.
takes the edge off.
mutes the emotional response.
you... You drugged her so she could lie?
never let the facts get in the way of the truth.
you know, I wanted to... Yeah, I know.
Thanks.
for what?
you had a slight gratitude smile.
what, you're surprised?
Really?
you know, just because I don't know your science doesn't mean I don't know things.
you know, when you don't know the science, you don't see the whole picture.
people can get hurt, you know?
what was that?
what happened?
what?
shame.
when you said people get hurt, you showed shame.
I don't know what you're talking about.
you're lying.
get used to it.
lie To Me Looks like national geographic exploded on your desk.
what expression do you see?
quick. Quick. Quick. Quick.
uh, uh, disgust. - Yep.
expression looks the same on a... Papua elder or...or a Hollywood starlet.
look at you in new Guinea.
you reliving your dissertation glory days?
what's this?
that's a Koteka.
that's hand-carved, very rare.
what do they use it for, soup?
genital presentation.
if the man was trying to impress a woman he'd serve himself up on that, so to speak.
Dr. Lightman, special agent Dardis is here from the FBI.
and I have your daughter on line two.
Thanks, Heidi.
Hello, love.
how's it going at your mom's?
okay, I guess. I mean, you know how mom is.
she needs to know everything I'm doing every second.
bloody intrusive, isn't it.
what are you doing this very second?
dad.
well, you still need a lift later?
uh, no, um, actually I've got a big chem test on Friday.
I... I'm gonna sleep over at Katie's house.
you sure about that? - Yeah.
all right, love you. - Love you, too.
you heard that, word repetition and her vocal pitch went up when she was talking about staying Katie's.
I'm sure it was nothing.
well, what did you hear then?
I heard a typical teenager in the process of forming her self-identity.
that's psychobabble, that is.
she was lying.
Emily needs to have her own secrets.
that's not the same thing as lying.
Danielle stark, 17 years old, senior at Strivers Magnet school.
she went missing a week ago.
her body was found a day later dumped in Rockcreek park.
she died from a blow to the head.
well, you're not here because of the girl, right?
no, her mother is a federal judge on the DC circuit court.
judge stark's been short-listed as a possible supreme court. No mine but we're treating this case just like any other.
well, is there any, uh, physical evidence?
unfortunately, it rained that night.
best we can do is determine that the blow came from the front, no defensive wounds, indicating Danielle likely knew her killer.
the problem is with the mother.
she says that she was alone in her chambers, and no one can verify it.
so you've got a suspect, right?
I mean, that's great, right, since you're treating this case just like any other.
as you can imagine, we have to proceed carefully before we start pointing fingers at a presidential appointee.
but if she's lying, we need to know.
and if not she's?
then we need to know who is.
nice place.
bit of a mausoleum.
Dr. Lightman, Ria Torres, this is Danielle's mother, judge Kathleen Stark.
agent Dardis tells me that you may be able to help catch the person who did this.
Yeah.
what is that for?
we just don't want to miss anything that could help.
so, what can you tell us about Danielle?
well, I've already told the FBI everything.
so what more do you want to know?
um, tell us about, uh, your happiest moment together.
a family trip, a birthday party?
I don't understand the purpose of this.
okay, um, how did you feel when you found out she was dead?
I, uh...
I really can't talk about it.
it was the worst day of my life.
do you have children, Dr. Lightman?
Yeah, I have a... a daughter.
she's a little younger than Danielle was.
then it shouldn't be hard for you to imagine how I felt.
was Danielle having any trouble at home?
of course not.
she was everything you could hope for in a daughter.
she was a straight-A student, top of her class.
she was so special.
please find out who did this to her.
it's pretty strange the way she talked about her daughter.
straight-a student. Top of her class.
who cares about that after they lose their child?
someone who's obsessed with image.
perfect house, perfect kid.
perfect kids don't usually get murdered by someone they know.
Yeah, well, Danielle wasn't so perfect.
well, it's not Danielle I'm concerned with.
she was always talking about how important her friends were to her.
you know, she was an only child and, uh...
I think she used them to substitute.
I've listened to a lot of grieving mothers, and if she's faking it, she's one of the best I've seen.
she's one of the best you've ever heard.
now, this was recorded in 1994, day after Susan Smith's two children disappeared.
I love 'em. I-I... I just can't express enough.
I-I have been to the lord in prayers every day.
it just seems so unfair that somebody could take such two beautiful children...
right. She told police that she'd been car jacked.
but later, she admitted to the police that she'd strapped her two children into their car seats and rolled them into the lake.
Yeah, now watch it with the sound off.
well, her face doesn't match the grief of her words.
right, there's no involvement in the forehead, nothing around the eyes.
she could be reading from a grocery list.
now watch the judge again.
they look exactly the same.
the judge is showing nothing.
no, the judge is showing everything.
judge Stark has asked for a brief mourning period, but she'll be available after tomorrow's memorial service.
Yeah, we need to be there.
we won't be able to talk to her.
we don't need to talk to her. We-we need to watch.
you coming to the funeral?
I can't. I'm meeting with the deputy chief of NASA.
one of their experimental jets crashed and they think the pilot's lying about what happened.
Oh, that's not surprising since the whole space program is based on lies.
some of their top scientists were Nazis recruited after the war.
they gave the world tang.
uh, Dr. Lightman? It's Emily.
uh, apparently they tried to bring her to your house first, but...
Hey, dad.
it wasn't even a party really.
it was just a couple of friends.
cops said there were more than a hundred kids at your mum's house while she was away.
so you lied to me about staying over at Katie's.
I already said I was sorry.
how many more times can I say it?
as many times as you want.
obviously I can't trust you to be on your own when your mum's away, so you're coming here every day after school till she gets back.
No! What am I going to do?
you're going to organize this room.
it... by myself?
Nope. Loker's going to babysit.
Hey, Emily. Long time no see.
Hey, you look terrible. Awful.
like Gene Simmons when it's really, really humid.
all right.
you got any gum? - What?
gum. Chewing gum. Got any gum?
uh, yeah, yeah.
thank you...
you get anything off her?
well, her tears are real.
I still didn't see any sadness on her forehead.
okay, that was disgusting.
just keep your eye on the judge.
Oh, that was interesting.
okay, you want to tell me what that was about?
still no action in the forehead, or around the eyes, even though she's startled.
okay.
most dinitely hiding something.
her age.
she's using Botox.
no wonder I couldn't pick anything up.
it paralyzes the facial muscles.
tears were real, and her forehead would show sadness if it could.
Yeah, but she still doesn't have an alibi for the night of the murder.
chances are, any mother who killed her daughter would display shame unless she was a sociopath.
if the mother's not lying, where does that leave us?
looking for someone else.
FBI says they think that Danielle knew her killer.
it's possible that person's here.
it's pretty risky to show up at the victim's memorial.
be it'd suspicious not to, especially if they were close.
you're looking at the x-48, or what's left of it.
I didn't realize NASA still did test flights.
shuttle program's coming to a close.
we're looking for the next generation.
this was supposed to be it.
now it's $250 million worth of scrap metal.
tell me about the pilot.
commander David Markov.
he's had an exemplary career. Navy pilot, flight instructor.
there's nothing on record to suggest he would have crashed the plane intentionally.
then what makes you think he did?
flight telemetry indicated no systems malfunction.
all of a sudden, Markov went full throttle, flaps down.
he ejected just before he dove the plane straight into the ground.
I don't believe he was just disoriented like he's claiming.
did he have some sort of issue with NASA?
no. But we have to consider Markov's father.
he was a rocket engineer with the old soviet space agency, defected in '72.
the Russians are developing their own scramjet technology.
russian spies?
Oh, what's next? Duran Duran and parachute pants? 'Cause I dug the '80'S.
it's what we've got.
commander Markov won't admit anything.
he's suspended pending the outcome of your investigation.
I was at angels ten, zone five after burners, cavu, and...
I just lost the bubble.
Oh, wow, that is so cool.
but I have no idea what you just said.
sorry, um...
I was at a cruising altitude of 10, 000 feet-- actually 10, 500-- going top speed.
I don't know what happened. I had good weather, unlimited visibility.
after that it just all went fuzzy.
you blacked out?
no, ma'am, I was fully conscious, but...
I got disoriented, lost track of time.
next thing I knew, the aircraft was pointed at the ground.
I managed to get to the ejection handles and punch out.
that's how I ended up with this.
commander Markov, your father came to this country in 1972?
he defected from the USSR.
you think I crashed the x-48 on purpose?
did you?
I love this country, Dr. Foster.
I'd give my life for it.
that's a nice deflection.
that was a non-answer.
you want to try it again?
I wanted to be an astronaut since I was eight years old.
and I trained for the space program every day knowing that I only had a one in 400 chance of getting in.
I did not intentionally crash the X-48.
Danielle was my best friend in the world.
I'm gonna miss her so much.
I'll never forget her laugh.
she had the greatest laugh.
she was one of my best friends.
Danielle loved high school, but she was also excited about the future.
we were even gonna apply to Princeton together.
now I'm not even sure if I want to go.
but I owe it to Danielle to follow my dreams.
well, she sure had a lot of best friends. - Yeah.
foster did a study once-- popularity and lies in schools. You know what she found?
there's a connection?
Yeah, the more popular the kid, the better the liar.
which makes me wonder why the queen bee showed asymmetrical sadness when she was talking about her dead friend.
uh, "when a person's facial expression "is not symmetrical on both sides of the face, "it is likely that they are pretending to feel the emotion.
from your article in the journal for behavioral science, 2001.
sucking up is really not your strong suit, is it?
that was a good speech.
um, thanks.
but you didn't mean a word of it, did you?
what? Who are you?
I'm Dr. Lightman.
we're helping the FBI with their investigation.
what kind of doctor are you?
I study people's lies, like the one you told in there about beg Danielle's best friend.
we were best friends.
then why were you faking being sad then?
I wasn't. I was just shocked, like everybody else.
you pluck your eyebrows?
what?
did you pluck your eyebrows before you came here so they'd be perfect just like that?
because signs of lying become particularly visible in the brows when they've been thinned.
you weren't shocked at all about Danielle's death, were you?
look, Danielle was into some pretty bad stuff.
w-was she using?
what was she on?
I don't know. Um, I heard she was scoring from some burnout on the school paper.
this loser basically just... - Riley?
you ready to go? - Yeah.
okay, please don't tell my dad that I talked to you guys, okay?
he's on the board of trustees at my school, and he'll freak.
you never told me about the eyebrow plucking thing. Where have you written about that?
nowhere. - Why not?
cause it's complete crap.
I can assure you we have no drug problem at Strivers Magnet school.
we have a strict honor code.
one infraction and you're out.
and family money can't buy you back in?
well, this is a public school.
we have a rigorous admissions policy, a wait list.
these students, they want to be here, and they know that we don't tolerate violations of the code.
one of your students was murdered. Another one sold drugs to her.
you don't think there's a connection?
what can we do to help?
I want you to announce a mandatory locker search for all the students - that were in Danielle's journalism class. - Okay.
well, that may take some time to coordinate with our school security.
no, no, no, I don't want you to actually search them.
I just want you to announce it.
in an effort to cooperate with the FBI's investigation, we will be searching the lockers of every student in Ms. Fife's journalism class.
I don't mean to speak out of turn, but the fourth amendment protects these kids against unreasonable search and seizure.
that's true. Absolutely true.
uh, truth is, I only want to talk to one of you.
just one of you.
the one everyone's afraid to look at.
I was at a cruising altitude of 10, 000 feet-- actually 10, 500.
so, captain Markov admitted a lack of memory about certain details.
he also useds pontaneous corrections: 10, 500 instead of 10, 000 feet.
so, he's lying?
no, those are all signs of telling the truth.
well, our doctors examined him after the crash. Medically, he checks out fine.
there's another possibility.
it's called a hysterical blackout.
it sometimes happens just before someone tries to take their own life.
you think he could have been trying to commit suicide?
and what, changed his mind at the last second and ejected?
it's a possibility, but I'll need assess his psychological state prior to the crash.
do you have any old videotape of him?
we're the federal government. We record everything.
Hey, have you seen these?
Oh, those are...
Yeah, those were probably taken in the '80s.
your dad was doing research in Morocco proving his theory on the universality of emotion.
research? Are you kidding? He's baked.
Oh, yeah, he's completely baked.
Ugh, he's such a hypocrite.
like getting mad at me for throwing a party.
I mean, look at him.
well, I think he's, um, I think he's just scared.
uh, no... no, I'm thinking wasted.
no, I mean, he's scared right now. About you.
why would he be scared about me?
well, you're a15-year-old girl.
statistically speaking, you're at the prime age for abusing alcohol, experimenting with drugs, contracting a sexually transmitted disease.
you really know how to take all the fun out of rebelling.
look on the bright side.
you're way more likely to die in a car crash with one of your friends than any of those things.
control, this is Zulu 7.
we are level and steady.
we have ignition. Execute roll program.
going through Mach 1... Mach 2...
is there something wrong with these speakers? I can barely hear him.
no, it's not the equipment. It's the man.
slow, soft speech points to extreme sadness and anxiety.
he doesn't sound like the same person we interviewed.
you still thinking suicide?
I was but then I saw this from four weeks ago.
commencing scramjet simulation.
let her fly, boys!
kick the tires and light the fires!
we have ignition.
Oh, yeah!
on all the tapes from before a month ago, Markov's mood is depressed.
but on all the tapes in the last few weeks, he's like this.
he appears confident, relaxed, happy.
something changed for him.
go ahead, call my parents.
I don't have to tell you anything, and there's nothing you can do about it.
Really?
my dad's a lawyer. I know my rights.
well, you're telling the truth about that. I think dad probably is a lawyer.
though I don't think he's the kind that's gonna help you out with a criminal case.
I'm thinking... bankruptcy?
real estate?
tax law?
Oh, there it is. Tax law.
you don't know anything.
we know the FBI's going to charge this as a federal drug crime.
five year minimum.
unless we try to help you out.
did you sell drugs to Danielle Stark?
Yeah, but I-I didn't kill her.
I mean, I didn't even sell her any hard stuff. All she wanted was Mph.
that's used to treat attention deficit disorder.
uh, how do you get high off that?
you don't. It helps you focus, cram for tests, pull all-nighters.
half the kids on honor roll are taking it.
they're taking add drugs to help them study?
Dr. Lightman?
can I have a word, please?
I'm afraid this is highly inappropriate.
well, you're definitely afraid.
no one wants to find the person who did this more than we do.
the board has offered a sizeable reward for any information leading to an arrest.
you've got kids here taking drugs to compete academically.
don't you think that may have had something to do with Danielle's death?
no, I don't. - Of course not.
you know... you're probably right.
I think we're finished here. Thanks.
that's it? We're leaving?
well, you can't get the right answers if you haven't got the right questions.
headmistress-- definitely hiding something.
I thought she didn't know about the drugs.
Yeah. Well, you brought up academic competition, she started caressing her own hand.
a self-comforting gesture.
trying to reassure yourself when you don't really believe what you're saying.
that one's real.
thanks for the tip.
ms. Torres, I thought we're clear about your involvement.
I'm not here to talk to any of your students.
uh, I came to congratulate you.
for what?
well, I was looking at your academic rankings for strivers over the past decade.
after you became headmistress three years ago, test scores shot up, your national ranking went through the roof.
I'm wondering how you pulled that off.
well, it wasn't hard. All I did was give our students the proper motivation.
what does that mean?
well, I restricted the number of Ivy League recommendations to the top kids in each graduating class.
so you've created a reward system that feeds into their fears.
if they're not on track by the time they're 17, it's too late?
well, we give our best students the best chance at success.
I need to see Danielle's academic records and transcripts all of the honor roll students.
you don't really think this had anything to do with her murder?
why not? You do.
david would never endanger himself or anyone else in the space program.
I used to tease him that was his second wife.
his first love is NASA. Always has been.
I know these are difficult questions, Mrs. Markov...
Hilary, please.
have you noticed any changes in your husband's behavior?
what do you mean?
well, has his-his mood changed in the last few weeks?
y... no. No, David's just David.
I mean, he's been under a lot of pressure lately, but I...
he's handled it just fine.
what pressure?
competition for the X-48 pilot slot was really intense.
it was hard on our whole family, but we got through it, and now things are great.
we've never been better.
did you catch the false start?
well, has his-his mood changed in the last few weeks?
y... no. No, David's just David.
she started to say yes, but she said no.
Yeah, and the slip of the tongue when she was talking about the pressure.
I mean, he's been under a lot of pressure lately, but I...
he's handled it just fine.
so, she's been handling it.
but he hasn't.
what's she hiding about him?
Oh, sex, drugs or money-- the holy trinity.
drugs could explain the change in demeanor.
aren't pilots drug-tested by NASA every couple of months?
for illegal narcotics, but drug tests are exclusive.
you have to choose what you want to screen for.
maybe he went on some kind of anti-anxiety medication a few weeks ago.
and if he stopped taking it right before the test flight, withdrawal symptoms can include suicidal impulses.
exactly.
I'll call NASA, have them run a new tox panel.
Oh, good job.
you got a future as a housekeeper.
Yeah. Not bad, right?
and you've got stuff here going back to the dark ages.
okay. I'm sorry I lied.
I totally deserve the punishment.
Yeah, apology accepted.
but can you remember this next time you decide to have a party behind my back?
Oh, I'm not sorry about that. Just that I lied to you about it.
you should check out my networker page.
I had 200 new friend requests, all because of that party.
Hey, since when do you care about being so popular?
I mean, you know the kind of trouble you can get into, a girl your age.
okay. Where is that coming from? Some case you're working on?
you know, what do you care?
what do you care about new friends if all they're looking for is a place to drink or to get high?
well, you're one to talk.
what do you... what do you call this?
research.
Oh, please!
those are Berber Nomads, completely cut off from western civilization.
I come on! Talk about joining the tribe.
it's not the same thing at all, and you know it.
uh, you were right about judge stark.
her alibi finally checked out.
FBI found surveillance footage of the courthouse where they can make her out.
so she didn't kill her daughter, then, eh?
no, but there's something you should see.
Danielle's academic transcripts. - I'll be right there.
conversation's not over.
Danielle's GPA was excellent.
but her SAT scores were barely average.
she took the test twice, scoring around the 65th percentile.
so?
well, she knew she wasn't going to make the top of her class, so she signed up to take the sat a third time.
score just got posted this week.
94th percentile?
that's quite an improvement. I wonder what she did differently.
I can tell you one thing. She got murdered the day before she took that test.
why would someone else take the sat for Danielle Stark the day after she was murdered?
uh, DC homicide kept the case quiet for 24 hours because of who the family is.
I got it.
Danielle's name, but look at the photo.
look familiar?
I don't know what this is. It must be some kind of prank by one of my students.
Danielle's ID wasn't stolen.
I think she gave it to you.
why would she do that?
well, so you could take the test for her.
I...
I do not have to listen to this!
well, you might want to try that move again, love. Really.
it was awful gestural timing.
what does that mean?
well, she voiced outrage, and then she slammed her hand down.
if she was truly outraged, it all would have happened at the same time.
look, we have the essay section of Danielle's test.
if you took the test for her, we'll just match the handwriting to yours.
do you have any idea how difficult it is to get by on a teacher's salary?
how am I ever gonna pay off a hundred grand in student loans?
Yeah, well, you've got a point there.
that sounds like motive to me.
no, no. This is insane.
I didn't know she was dead when I took the test.
why would I have taken it if I killed her?
maybe she threatened to expose you, things got out of hand.
so you decided to build yourself an alibi. - No.
nothing got out of hand.
we just... we had an argument.
about what?
Danielle contacted me through e-mail, but she didn't tell me what score she wanted on the test.
I can hit any percentile I want.
it avoids raising too much suspicion.
but when I asked her, she looked at me like she didn't know what I was talking about.
I mean, she hired me.
and where exactly were you when you had this argument?
I'm ready to arrest the teacher.
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
she had opportunity and motive, and she admits to arguing with Danielle the day before the murder.
Yeah, but I saw no signs that she was lying, and typically, only an innocent person's gonna admit to an argument.
a guilty person won't admit to anything that would seem incriminating.
you're saying it wasn't her?
don't know, but I'd like to see how she reacted when she was confronted by her teacher.
I want to see the tape from that video camera the day that she was confronted.
there's still no audio. You won't be able to hear what Danielle said.
I don't need to hear what she said. I just want to see her face.
Emily, let me help you.
Oh, yeah. Thanks, Gillian.
you okay?
Yeah. Just my dad being...
Yeah, he can do that.
he never lets me do anything fun.
Oh, you mean like having a hundred friends over and getting pulled in by the cops?
uh, yeah. Yeah, like that.
he knew something was going on when you called, you know.
he did? Well, why didn't he say anything?
if he said something every time you lied to him, oh, he knows he'd lose you.
tox results are in.
buck rogers tested positive for a little drug we call Venlafaxine.
for treating depression and anxiety.
he was self-medicating and lying about it to NASA.
Yeah, but the tox screen showed he was still taking the drug at the time of the crash.
he didn't have a suicidal impulse from withdrawal.
well, then why did he crash the plane?
the drug's side effects include time loss, disorientation, and dizziness.
you add intense speed and G-force from the new jet technology, you've got a very pricey pile of scrap metal.
I didn't take any medication. I've never even heard of... what's it called?
Venlafaxine.
the tox screen doesn't lie, commander.
well, maybe it's a mistake. I mean, labs have been known to make mistakes.
commander Markov, I'm turning your case over to the justice department, effective immediately.
I wasn't taking anything.
you have to believe me.
can I have a second?
I think the commander is telling the truth.
what he's saying isn't true.
you can say something that's untrue and still not be lying.
how?
if you don't know it's a lie.
I don't understand. You're saying that my wife was dosing me?
either she did it or you did.
tell them, Hil. This is the craziest thing I've ever heard.
David, let me explain.
you did this? You drugged me?
I was trying to help you.
what did you do? Did you slip it in my coffee? I don't understand.
I researched all the drugs.
those side effects are incredibly rare.
I didn't know they could make you crash.
I'm going to lose my job. We are going to lose everything.
we were already losing everything.
you were so anxious all the time.
I was scared.
the kids were scared.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you, but think about it.
how have you been feeling lately?
about me.
about the kids.
how have you been feeling, David?
better.
okay, there's the teacher. There's Danielle.
can you zoom in on her face?
no, you can't see her face. It's on her back when they start talking.
try a trophy cabinet.
Oh, there she is.
can you blow up her eyebrows?
and do that thing.
okay... what do you see?
true surprise.
lasts less than one second, right?
she hasn't got a clue what her teacher is talking about.
but if Danielle didn't hire Fifeto cheat for her, then who did?
someone who wanted her to succeed more than she did.
I did it for Danielle.
well, why didn't you tell us?
well, what did that have to do with anything?
I just wanted what was best for her.
best for her or u?
I knew that if she could just get into a good college, she would shine, but she wasn't going to get in.
not with her scores.
so, you hired the teacher?
to tutor her.
they worked together for weeks, but Danielle's second SAT was just as bad as the first.
she... was... desperate.
no, you were desperate, right?
I created an e-mail account in Danielle's name, and I contacted Ms. Fife again.
I'd heard rumors that she had done this for other students, and, well, Danielle didn't even have to know.
but she found out, right?
she came home that night furious.
I had never seen her so angry.
she said that I didn't trust her.
now, if Danielle threatened to expose the cheating, that would put her at risk.
if I had contributed to her death in any way...
do you know any of the other kids that were involved in this?
we need to get back to the student IDs, find out who else this teacher was cheating for.
I've never cheated before in my life.
I've always done my own work.
so, what was Ms. Fife's photo doing in your student ID?
I don't know. I swear.
your last sat score went up 320 points. How do you explain that?
I studied really hard.
you know, your daughter is a really good liar.
I don't know what you mean.
well, studies show that popular kids are the most facile.
they adapt quickly to hide their true feelings.
let's talk about Danielle's murder. Where were you that night?
what?
you can't be serious.
Oh, my god, she was my best friend.
sure, she was.
right up until she threatened to expose the cheating scandal and ruin your college career.
what kind of person do you think I am?
you tell me.
I would never hurt Danielle, not in a million years.
that's enough, please.
I can't do this.
do you know what your daughter did, sir? Did she tell you?
no. - You sure?
she had nothing to do with this.
it was me.
I overheard Danielle arguing with Riley and threatening to expose her.
I couldn't... I couldn't let her ruin my daughter's life.
so, I...
followed her into the park and...
I-I did it.
I killed her.
you're under arrest for the murder of Danielle Stark.
there's just... there's one problem.
I don't think he did it.
how you doing?
I've got, uh... I've got nothing more to say.
I'm not FBI.
I told them to wait outside, so...
Why? I told them what I did. I killed her.
Yeah. I just want to show you a few photographs. Okay.
what do you see?
what is this?
it's the stratton-meyerhoff personality test.
so, please, what do you see?
it's a clown.
I know it's a clown.
what emotion does he make you feel?
what does this have to do with anything? - It's a simple question, it's a simple question.
what do you see?
sadness. I guess.
okay, well, that's good.
and this one?
happiness, joy. I don't know.
and... this one?
what are you trying to do?
I'm trying to prove that you didn't kill Danielle Stark.
but I told you that I did.
now, Mr. Berenson, there is no stratton-meyerhoff test. I just made that up.
I wanted to get a...
an honest reaction to this photograph, and what I got was...
Horror...and surprise.
now, the real killer, if confronted with his victim, would show disgust, contempt, even fear.
but not surprise.
never surprise.
now, Mr. Berenson, trying to protect your daughter.
you probably even think that you're doing the right thing by taking the blame for her.
you can't protect her from this.
I can't.
I can't let my daughter go to prison.
she didn't mean to kill her. She was just...
just trying to stop...
I wish she had never told me.
I wish I didn't know.
you ready?
I'll send you the bill.
what?
nothing. Good work.
I know what you were saying before about girls my age.
good.
and considering...
I guess you do a pretty good job of restraining yourself.
from what?
from calling me a liar when you know I'm up to something.
well, I'm sorry I always know.
you don't always know.
lie To Me
a fema spokesman on the scene refused to comment, but channel eight news has learned that two construction workers have been killed, while others may still be buried alive beneath tons of concrete and steel.
for now, all of Frostburgcan only watch and wait as the rescue effort proceeds.
everybody just calm down.
my construction company's built a dozen of these eco-buildings.
we've never had anything more than a minor injury.
what are you implying? - Don't look at me.
city in spections found no evidence of any sequencing issues in the construction!
well, maybe you missed something!
if you took the proper safety precautions, how would something like this have happened?
Oh, no. No, I am not going to take the fall on this.
what the hell is that?
Hello? Is this thing on? - Who the hell are you?
Dr. Lightman, thanks so much for coming down right away.
Stevens, right? - Right.
Dr. Lightman is here to assist fema in the rescue eorts.
Assist"? How?
he's a deception expert.
he's worked with fema on half a dozen cases.
I want you to give him your full cooperation.
who's lying?
well, you're all pointing fingers and shifting blame, which is typical of a disaster rescue oration, which is going to guarantee you won't find your men.
we've pulled out nine men, two in body bags three are still missing: Blunt, denman and kisker.
how long they been gone?
15 hours. No sign of them.
Yeah, we're not going to find any sign of them standing around here talking either.
who are you?
Kevin warren. I own green city construction.
those are my men buried down there. - They're my men, too.
those missing men are all from Frostburg.
Meredith Fallon. I'm the mayor.
this is the city engineer, Mark Boulware.
we've been focusing our search here.
southeast quadrant, 2b.
that's where the missing men were last seen.
collapse brought down six stories of concrete right on top of them.
in our experience, if we don't get to them within 24 hours, the odds offinding them alive go way down.
well, then you'd better move fast, don't you?
so who do you want to talk to first?
I need to talk to whoever saw them last.
I have an early meeting tomorrow that I need you and Loker to take on your own.
did you ndr. Lightman?
FEMA confirmed he's at the disaster site.
I'm heading out there now while there are still one or two people he hasn't had time to alienate.
better drive fast.
Dr. Foster? Dr. Foster? - Yes.
Dr. Lightman is waiting for you. Come this way.
Yeah, we were all on the same sub crew.
been working together since we built these foundations.
and you left the men just before the collapse?
Yeah, like, two, three minutes at the most.
we were laying down rebar, southeast quadrant, and I had to take a leak.
uh, I was in and out of the john and then I felt the ground shaking.
and I hit the dirt.
I thought, you know, these guys are trapped down there, and I can't even get to them .
I can't imagine what you must be feeling right now.
but I don't think you have any trouble imagining how you're feeling right now.
what?
I think you've imagined this while story you're telling.
are you calling me a liar?
your eyes are calling you a liar; we just work here.
when people feel genuine guilt, they always look down and away.
you were looking straight at us.
the search team hasn't been able to find the men where you said they were.
look, we're just trying to understand what happened here.
it says here that you were hurt on a construction job earlier this year.
it had you out of commission for almost three months.
Yeah, yeah. I almost broke my neckon a nonunion contract.
I was lifting pylons.
what expression do you see?
expression?
what emotion do you think this person is feeling right now?
I don't know. Angry?
no, surprised.
and... in this one?
Barrassed? - Happiness.
and... this one?
disgusted. - Correct.
you're having trouble recognizing every emotion except disgust.
it's a pattern we found sometimes with people who are addicted to opiates.
you can recognize disgust, because you see it over and over from your friends and family.
I'm guessing that after you ran out of pain meds for your neck injury, you started self-medicating.
Hey, I've donetons of drugs.
I understand completely.
Mr. Spaly, did you lie about where you were before the collapse because you were getting high someplace else?
who's that? Who's that? And who's that? - Kisker. That's denman.
and who's that? - I know their names.
they're missing, mr. Spaly.
okay, look, I came up.
I went to my lockerand I got my stash. All right, I was
I lost track of time, but I wasn't gone from down there more than an hour!
so you saw the men in the southeast quadrant an hour before the collapse?
this entire operation has been focused on 2b in the southeast quad based on what you told us!
they could be anywhere, on any level!
hold the work! Stop! Hold the work!
30 seconds of silence! Now!
bring the dogs back in!
Hey, we've got some banging over here!
they're down here!
let's hope the dogs aren't lying, too.
I've read about your marriage experiments, and I had my people do a little research into the work you do here.
okay.
long and short is, I'm about to ask my girlfriend, Nadia, to marry me.
Oh, mazel tov.
it's a good thing you're starting young. It took my father five times to get it right.
affair, alcohol, green card problems, affair
so, when my company, networker, went public, I did, uh... well.
Yeah, I'd call banking four- and-a-half billion dollars doing very well.
before I propose to na a, I have to know if she loves me for the right reasons.
what makes you think she doesn't?
Nadia grew up with nothing.
her father was a short-order cook, in and out of work.
she's struggled with money her whole life:
student loans, credit card debt.- so?
so, right after my company went public, my partner's wife left him and took their two-year-old daughter.
she used the little girl against him for a huge settlement.
so what is it you'd like us to do?
Nadia says she had no idea who I was before we met.
I just want to make sure she's telling the truth.
Dr. Lightman does deception detect n for the fbi, tsa, police...
we don't snoop into people's personal lives.
but thanks for coming in.
your web site's incredibly useful for reconnecting with girls who rejected me in middle school.
look, just do your boss a favor, and make a decision after you look.
I think that's the micro expression for "holy crap.
we're dropping fiber-optic cameras into the collapsed structure, and the crawler drills will be boring through the debris to create a hole through which we will then pull out the men.
mayor fallon.
and we have every reason to believe that mr. Blunt, mr. Denman and mr. Kisker are alive.
and the drills are the best way to reach the men?
they've been down there for 19 hours now.
we have to reach them as quickly as possible.
no expense will be spared to save them.
and I want to reiterate that no wrongdoing has occurred in the construction on this site.
you know, I'm going to let you handle the questions.
I really need to get back to the family.
excuse me, I'm going to get back to the families.
mayor fallon, hi. I'm gillian foster.
I know who you are.
we really appreciate your help here.
any idea how this happened? - No.
you lied when you said there was "no wrongdoing"on the site.
why was that? - Oh, that was just.
that was just what?
I pressured the green cityconstruction to hire more Frostburg workers than they needed.
none of our men would have even been there if it weren't for me.
how did you pressure them?
permits and zoning.
I helped them clear some bureaucratic hurdles.
I don't know what things are like for youdc folks, but things have gotten real bad for Frostburg with the recession.
the site was going to bring a whole new industry here;
our silicon valley, thousands of new jobs.
if I can help with anything else, please call my office.
thank you.
we've got video!
there they are!
they're alive!
can I see that? No. Can I? Thank you.
it's Blunt, Denman and Kisker.
that's kisker. His leg's crushed.
there's a lot of blood.
I can't really feel my toes.
Oh, my god. Baby! Someone's gotto help him.
we are trying Mrs. Kisker.
we rigged a tourniquet on it, but he's not doing so good.
Jered, are you hurt?
I'm okay, Valerie.
we're all banged up a little, but we're okay.
and I love you, Valerie.
all right, let's get you back to the staging area.
I will keep you updated. - I'm staying here.
I'm sorry. We have to bring you back to the tent.
Dr. Lightman.
my men need engineers and rescue workers, not a couple of freak show shrinks pointing fingers.
she's the shrink. I'm the freak show.
I'm sorry, we normally wear labels. Hello?
can you tell me what happened?
the sub roof just started coming down.
once we heard it, we went to the elevator shaft, but we couldn't get there in time.
is there any way you can get over there now?
we've tried, but the substructure floor between here and the shaft is just too unstable, it could give out.
he's right. We haven't even completed that substructure floor yet.
that man could bleed out down there. We have to drill faster.
listen, guys, I promise you, we're going to get you guys up from out of there, okay?
just sit tight. The drill should reach you in aew hours.
we're going to do whatever it takes. You're going to be rescued.
did you see that? - Yeah.
see what?
Hey, um, mr. Blunt? - Yeah? What is it?
Mr. Blunt, can you hear me? - We lost the feed.
all right, we lost the feed. Can you trace the line?
guys, talk to me. I need to know why we got cut off.
we've got men down there, and we need to communicate with them.
can you rewind it back to the point where they'd just been told they were going to be rescued?
uh, these two men are showing joy and relief.
Yeah, freeze there.
can we push in on this man?
okay. Lips stretched. Can you pan up to the eyes?
eyelids retracted. - Fear.
that's concealed fear.
well, he's buried under 50 tonsof concrete and steel.
what the hell were you expecting? - Relief.
I don't expect a man who's just been told he's going to be rescued to show fear, and everyone else is showing relief.
maybe he doesn't believe he can be rescued.
post traumatic stresscan stifle almost any positive emotion.
maybe, uh...
Mr. Blunt doesn't want to be rescued.
who wouldn't want to be rescued?
someone who caused the collapse in the first place.
you think Blunt might've intentionally caused the collapse?
well, that would explain the look of fear.
best explanation we've got.
this is unbelievable.
how long has Jered Blunt worked for you, Mr. Warren?
about six months.
any problems? Did he threaten violence against the company?
Yeah, he confronted me a few times.
in fact, he sent a threatening letter to my office, complaining about overtime.
why didn't you fire him?
well, believe me, I tried. The union blocked.
why would Blunt sabotage the building while he was still inside it?
well, maybe he got trapped down there.
can you replay the video again? - Okay.
we're up.
we're all banged up a little, but we're okay.
and I love you, Valerie.
wait, freeze it! Freeze it!
look at that. There's charring on the concrete.
burn marks from an explosion. - Damn.
what's wrong?
blunt could have used explosives to try to blow up the building.
that could have caused the collapse.
if he did this, he could be trying to sabotage our rescue efforts, too.
there could be more explosives down there.
what about my other guys? We need to get them out of there.
they're trapped right here, in the northwest quadrant.
they can get across to the elevator shaft here, they'd be protected from another explosion.
no way. This floor's too unstable to get there. They'd never make it.
we're getting ready to send rescue workers down there.
if there are undetonated explosives, I can't move forward.
Dr. Lightman, can you find out from Blunt if he did this so we know if it's safe to get these men down there?
if you get the live feed back, I can talk to him directly.
we have to get it back up then.
we won't get anything from Blunt that way.
he's not going to admit to blowing up the building when he's still down there with his crew.
then what the hell are we going to do?
cause we're just wasting time here, and Kisker's down the bleeding.
violence in the workplace correlates to domestic violence.
a guy doesn't blows up a building without that anger spilling over at home.
we should talk to his wife.
my father would have been proud of these men.
when he was mayor, it was his dream to try to bring industry to our city, and we're fulfilling that dream and I am proud of our strengthing this difficult time.
and once we get the men out.
excuse me. Is Valerie Blunt here?
we'll rely on each other to get through this.
thank you. - Just as we always have.
I know you're concerned, and I'll take question one at a time. Please...
we met in high school.
I was a cheer leader and Jered was a third-string running back.
ridiculous, right? But we fell in love.
are you still in love?
of course. I mean, you know, it'S... it's not perfect; it'S...
it's a marriage.
I can't believe this happened after everything else this year.
you and your husband have been through a lot?
no, no. I just mean, um...
with how hard it is to find work around here for anyone
maybe he's just crazy.
what? - Your husband, maybe he's just bonkers.
what... what are you talking about?
he was arguing with the company, he was constantly getting into fights, right?
what my partner is dancing around here is that we think your husband just lost it and blew up the building.
Jered would never do that. - What are you doing?
this isn't appropriate. - There's something she's not telling us.
we're wasting time. - I'm sorry.
I'm sick of watching you coddle these women.
well, I'm sick of you derailing this investigation.
you know, you can be a bitch sometimes.
who the hell are you people?
stay away from me!
you almost didn't sell it. I'm going to have to hit you harder next time.
you know, you take a little bit too much pleasure in that one.
Valerie Blunt was disgusted when you slapped me, but she wasn't afraid she showing no heightened sensitivity to violence between a man and a woman.
I think it's unlikely she was abused.
so you don't think her husband could have blown up the building?
with no violence at home? It's hard to believe.
it's loker. Give me a second.
yeah? Take it.
Yeah. Yeah.
what was that? A job? - Yeah.
you going to tellme what it is?
I don't need your permission to take on a case.
that depends on the case, doesn't it really?
it'll be fine, I promise.
that usually means I'm getting screwed.
usually.
isn't that the head of green city construction?
Warren? With mrs. Blunt?
less than a footand a half between them a flash glance from her fobere a quick turn away.
they've been intimate before.
you know, Valerie Blunt was hiding something when you asked if she and her husband had problems, eyelids fluttered.
there was something she didn't want to say.
maybe her husband wasn't the perpetrator. Maybe he was the target.
so warren sleeps with Blunt's wife, and then buries him alive?
if you would think I would have anything to do with this, you are completely out of your mind.
why would I sabotage my own job, own company?
for, for woman?
and I got ten guys on this crew at least who can tell you exactly where I've been on this site every minute of the last three days.
I haven't been down to the substructure for weeks.
but you and mrs. Blunt had an affair, right?
it wasn't an affair. They were separated at the time.
and he'd hardly spoken to her for six months before they broke up.
why did your relationship end?
I just wasn't into it anymore.
you know, I told her I just wasn't really feeling it, you know?
that's a lot of anger you're showing for a woman you don't care about.
men usually reserve that kind of anger for won that they love.
I don't know why it ended, oy?
I thought we were on cloud nine.
we both felt like we were kids again.
we were out to dinner one night, she got a phone call from Blunt;
she spoke to him for about five minutes and she bolted out of the restaurant, I don't know.
she went running back to him, just like that, so...
you believe him?
well, he's pretty confident about his alibi.
and he used similes and metaphors when he was talking about Valerie Blunt.
we were on cloud nine. Felt like kids again.
people don't use that kind of language when they're lying.
what do you think Blunt told her that brought her running back?
there's something going on between them.
and we still don't know why he showed fear when he found out he was going to be rescued.
I need to know what else Loker found on the footage.
it's hot down here, but there's still air.
can we zoom in on his left cheek and forehead, Sylvia?
Oh, there's that thing again.
what is that? Contempt?
could be contempt. Its unilateral.
I need to borrow Michael. We're going to go meet our billionaire's girlfriend, Nadia Dawson.
easy, tiger. She's only into guys making ten figures.
maybe she really loves him.
Yeah, righ what makes you so sure?
the female hanging fly. - What?
the female hanging fly.
she'll only mate with a male when he brings her a caterpillar as a food offering.
the bigger the offering, the more time she will have intercourse with him.
for insects, it's food. For us, it's money.
she's a female hanging fly.
okay, you need to get out more.
look, I don't care if she's into him for his money, as long as she is up front about it from the beginning.
Yeah, well, it's not always so easy to be open about money.
I always tell women exactly how much I have in the bank on the first date.
and you wonder why you never get a second.
good luck. Dr. Lightman's on the line.
so it's a contraction of Blunt's orbicularis, corrugator and frontalis muscles.
I'm thinking contempt.
maybe he did try to bring down the building after all.
no, that's not contempt.
well, what is it?
Mr. Blunt's a very sick man.
I wouldn't feel too well either if I were buried under a building.
no. He was sick long before he was buried.
almost got the feed back up.
how's your husband? - How'd you know...
don't do that.
can you still hear us? - Yeah.
we hear you. - Got it. How's Mr. Kisker?
he's not good. You need to get us out of here.
Mr. Blunt, I need you to tell us something.
what is it?
on the video footagewe got of you back here, I noticed something a little peculiar.
you have a rippling contraction of your facial muscles.
I don't understand.
well, you haven't been well, have you?
what do you mean?
your muscle contraction is a symptom of late-stage multiple sclerosis.
no. I don't know what you're talking about.
when you and your wife were separated
something that you told her over the phone brought her running back to you.
are you sick?
Mr. Blunt, it's okay.
Mr. Blunt, your friend could bleed to death.
I never meant for any of this to happen.
but we got no savings. I don't have insurance.
doctors say I got... I got a few years.
I didn't want to leave Valerie with nothing.
when you were told you were gonna be rescued, you looked scared.
what were you afraid we were going to find out?
I was working near the elevator shaft.
my hands have been shaking a lot, and I... I didn't, um...
I was trying to hold on to my blowtorch and I couldn't and it fell...
from b-1, two floors down to b-3.
the tank must have exploded.
I didn't realize I was putting you guys in danger, I swear.
hello. Can I help you?
are you Nadia Dawson? - Yes.
I'm Christina Lopez.
I was three years behind you in north Columbus.
you played softball for Ms. Sleevi? Pitcher, right?
Yeah. - Yeah.
she always said you had the best pickoff move.
that is so funny.
are you staying here at the hotel...
I'm sorry, what wasit, Christina? - Yeah.
I was just here for a meeting. You been working here a long time?
almost a year.
it turns out Georgetown actually wants you to pay for classes, so...
how weird running into someone from N. C.High-- here.
ms. Sleevi would always say, "You got four bases, three strikes, two teams, but only one winner.
so what brought you to D. C?
um, well, my boyfriend started a company that's based here.
it's one of those social internet sites the kids are into.
Oh, which one?
you're dating the founder of networker?
Yeah.
wow, how'd that happen? - What do you mean?
I mean, it's just a long wayvfrom north Columbus.
Yeah, I guess so.
how'd you meet him? - Yeah, it's the funniest thing.
I obviously had heard of the company, but I had no idea who he was.
I just saw this adorable guy standing right here at the bar trying to get a drink.
Yeah, that is funny.
it must be strange to come from north columbus and now to be with someone so well off.
take a look at this, Mr. Kachani.
you got four bases, three strikes, two teams, but only one winner.
that's Nadia telling the truth.
she's talking with her hands, what we call illustrators.
but when she's asked if she knew who you were when you met...
Yes, the funniest thing.
I'd obviously heard of the company, but I had no idea who he was.
I just saw this adorable guy standing there at the bar.
no more illustrators.
her hands are in her lap.
it must be strange coming from north columbus and now to dating someone so well off.
instead, she touches her watchand... her earring. Manipulators.
when you see illustrators decrease and manipulators increase
scratching, licking the lips, or in this case, touching jewelry, it's a sign of lying.
I can't believe this.
whatever she told you, she knew who you were when you met.
you have my check. - Mr. Kachani...
I don't want to see any more.
Mr. Kachani...
I though he was coming back in tomorrow.
he said he couldn't wait. - What did you tell him?
the truth-- she's after his money.
that's not the whole truth.
it's all he wanted to know.
Yeah, but that's not all we found out.
we're sure it was an accident? - Of course it was.
we never intentionally do harm to the building.
mayor Fallon is right. We've ruled out the possibilityof explosives.
should be able to reach the men within the hour.
what was the exact cause?
detonation of a blowtorch acetylene tank dropped through the substructure by mr. Blunt.
that man doesn't believe a word he just said.
no, he doesn'T.
the specifics of the collapse pattern are consistent with Blunt's description.
maybe he knows what really happened.
Hey, stevens. You got a problem.
the city engineer doesn't believe that blowtorch caused the building to collapse.
of course he does. He said so.
the engineer is lying.
he knows something about how this collapse happened.
five minutes ago you told me Blunt caused the collapse.
who the hell am I supposed to believe?
well, I'll tell you who not to believe.
that guy.
I've been in love with the same woman for 30-plus years...
the same woman for 30-plus years...
thanks for coming back in, Mr. Kachani.
I don't understand why I'm here.
well, the fact that Nadia knew who you were before you met isn't the only thing we learned when I talked to her.
okay. - Look at this.
and the way he hates breakfast food, and how frustrated he gets in traffic.
I don't know, I just love everything about him. I...
I want to spend the rest of my life with him.
there.
that's an illustrato there she is telling the truth.
she does love you, and your money.
you're lying to yourself if you think you can separate the two.
she lied to me.
well, why are you in love with Nadia?
she's charming, she's intelligent and... oh, wait for it...
she's beautiful.
how's her beauty any different from your money?
I don't know. - Exactly.
just be honest with her. - And yourself.
and get a prenup.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I didn't shrug my shoulders.
Yeah, you don't believe the blowtorch caused the explosion, do you, Mr. Boulware?
Yes, I do.
what's he doing?
11 beats every five seconds.
that's 132 beats per minute.
what are you talking about?
your carotid artery is pulsing 132 beats per minute.
your heart's racing. Why are you so tense?
maybe you found something in your inspections that could have caused the collapse.
I didn't find anything.
now that's the truth. Now you'retelling the truth.
so I'm thinking, maybe you didn't find anything, because you didn't do the proper inspections.
there are three men trapped underneath us.
and if you know there's a problem and something happensto them.
it's going to be your fault.
my wife and I were three payments behind on our mortgage.
we were gonna get foreclosed.
I don't know where the hell the money came from.
money? - And a note.
from who? - I don't know.
it just said to skip the inspections and sign off on the approvals.
well, why would someone pay you off? What was it they didn't want you to find?
look, usually these inspections are pro forma.
I'm sure someone just wanted to move things along faster.
Mr. Boulware, you don't believe that's all it is.
now you're minimizing--you're playing down your responsibility for what's gone wrong.
you don't want to admit how big a risk you really took with these men's lives.
but you need to tell us, what is the worst thing somebody could be trying to hide on this site?
there. There.
what were you thinking?
soon as the drill sallow us to pull them through, we're gonna get your husband out of there.
please. He's everything.
just get him out of there.
Hey, Stevens! - You have to.
weill, Mrs. Blunt, I promise. - Stevens!
you have to stop the drilling.
what are you talking about? - Tell him.
we can't drill-- there could be methane gas down there. - Methane?
if there's methane down there, Blunt's blowtorch could've ignited it, causing the explosion.
the drills could set off another one!
environmental testing was done on this site months ago.
there's no signs of any gas.
no, he took a bribe;proper inspections weren't done. - What?
I went back over thold geologic surveys.
decades ago, this entire area was a landfill, and there could be methane seeping up from it.
how could you have signed off without the inspections?
just stop the drilsand do the testing!
methane testing takes hours.
these men have been trapped for almost a full day.
one man is dying down there.
we could lose him while we do this testing.
someone paid this man not to do his job. You don't care who or why?
I'll let the cops deal with him. I'm not wasting any more time.
I am saving these men;we are drilling.
eight to one. - What?
eight to one. Average ratio of firefighter deaths in the U. S. Compared to every other country - with the same training, effectiveness and equipment. - So what?
we have a hero complex in this country.
our firefighters rush in too quickly, trying to live up to the expectation that they're heroes, and more of our men get killed.
step back. And that is an order! Now!
almost! Ten more feet! Power up to 800 rpm's!
you guys all right?
it's hard to breathe--the air's getting thick.
is that the methane?
it could explode;the drills could set it off.
you got to tell me what's going on.
this is the city engineer. I think there's a pool of methane seeping up from underneath you.
methane?
is there any place they can get to where they'll be safer?
you need to try to getto the elevator shaft. You needto go now.
come on, Blunt! - Tell my wife... I love her.
if the drillshit that methane...
we got to stop the drilling.
stop the drilling! Stop the drilling!
I don't hear anything!
I got nothing!
can you hear me?
Yes! Yes! We got one!
he's on come on, come on.
where is he? Where's Jered?
blunt let us go first.
he didn't make it into the shaft, and, uh... fires...
sorry. I'm so sorry.
FBI is here. What do you want to do?
you talk, I'll watch, okay? - Okay.
Kevin Warren? - Yeah.
you have the right to remain silent. - What?
anything you say or docan be used against you.
are you kidding me? Wh-what is this?
you found out there was methane underneath this site, and you knew it would derail this project.
that's crazy.
and you tried to bribe the city engineer to sign off without prer inspections.
Oh, this is crazy. I would never do anything to risk my guys' lives.
and if there was methane, I didn't know about it.
that's the truth.
I know you didn't, because you showed true surprise when you were accused.
everybody here was surprised, outraged...
except for one.
one person was relieved.
when a guilty person sees someone accused of the crime that they committed...
they show relief.
your father tried to bring a factory to Frostburg when he was mayor, and he couldn'T.
is that how you found out about the methane?
I never thought anything like this could happen.
I didn'T. I didn'T.
we needed the jobs.
I'm sorry.
fink<u> This is the Thing</u>
I thought you could use a real drink.
and a bath.
mm, well, I can't help you with that.
why do people always think they're the only one with a secret?
human nature, of course.
if the mayor had told the truth, or Blunt had been honest about his illness.
hmm, none of this would've happened.
if the lies hadn't come together.
they always do.
all right. No one's safe, I want them back.
tragedy has struck the small town of Frostburg, Maryland,
where a factory under construction
has suffered a devastating collapse.
a FEMA spokesman on the scene refused to comment,
but channel eight news has learned that
two construction workers have been killed,
while others may still be buried alive
beneath tons of concrete and steel.
FEMA STAGING
everybody just calm down.
everybody just calm down.
my construction company's built a dozen of these buildings.
we've never had anything more than a minor injury. What do you imply?
don't look at me. City inspections found no evidence
of any sequencing issues in the construction!
well, maybe you missed something!
if you took the proper safety precautions, how would something like this have happen?
no, I am not going to take the fall on this.
what the hell is that?
Hello?
is this thing on?
who the hell are you?
Dr. Lightman, thanks so much for coming down right away.
Stevens, right?
Dr. Lightman is here to assist FEMA in the rescue efforts.
assist? how?
he's a deception expert.
he's worked with FEMA on half a dozen cases.
I want you to give him your full cooperation.
who's lying?
well, you're all pointing fingers and shifting blame,
which is typical of a disaster rescue operation,
which is going to guarantee you won't find your men.
we've pulled out nine men, two in body bags.
three are still missing.
blunt, Denman and Kisker.
how long they been gone?
15 hours. No sign of them.
Yeah, we're not going to find
any sign of them standing around here talking either.
who are you?
Kevin Warren. I own Green City Construction.
those are my men buried down there.
they're my men, too.
those missing men are all from Frostburg.
Meredith Fallon. I'm the mayor.
this is the city engineer, Mark Boulware.
we've been focusing our search here.
southeast quadrant, 2b.
that's where the missing men were last seen.
collapse brought down six stories of concrete right on top of them.
in our experience, if we don't get to them
within 24 hours, the odds of finding them alive go way down.
well, then you'd better move fast, don't you?
so who do you want to talk to first?
I need to talk to whoever saw them last.
I've got an early meeting tomorrow
that I need you and loker to take on your own.
did you find Dr. Lightman?
FEMA confirmed he's at the disaster site.
I'm heading out there now while there are still
one or two people he hasn't had time to alienate.
better drive fast.
Dr. Foster?
Dr. Foster? - Yes.
Dr. Lightman is waiting for you.
come this way.
Yeah, we were all on the same sub crew.
we've been working together since we built these foundations.
and you left the men just before the collapse?
Yeah, like, two, three minutes at the most.
we were laying down rebar,
southeast quadrant, and I had to take a leak.
uh, I was in and out of the john
and then I felt the ground shaking.
and I hit the dirt.
I thought, you know, these guys are trapped down there,
and I can't even get to them.
I can't imagine what you must be feeling right now.
but I don't think you have any trouble
imagining how you're feeling right now.
what? - I think you've imagined this whole story
you're telling.
are you calling me a liar? - ？Your eyes - Are calling you a liar; - We just work here.
when people feel genuine guilt, they always look down and away.
you were looking straight at us.
the search team hasn't been able to find the men where you said they were.
look, we're just trying to understand
what happened here.
it says here that you were hurt on a construction job earlier this year.
it had you out of commission - For almost three months. - Yeah, yeah.
I almost broke my neck on a nonunion contract.
I was lifting pylons.
what expression do you see?
expression?
what emotion do you think this person is feeling right now?
I don't know. angry?
no, surprised.
and... in this one?
embarrassed? - happiness.
and... this one?
disgusted.
correct.
you're having trouble recognizing
every emotion except disgust.
it's a pattern we found sometimes with people who are addicted to opiates.
you can recognize disgust,
because you see it over and over from your friends in family.
I'm guessing that after you ran out
of pain meds for your neck injury,
you started self-medicating.
Hey, I've done tons of drugs.
I understand completely.
Mr. Spaly, did you lie about where you were before
the collapse because you were getting high someplace else?
Hey! who's that?
who's that? and who's that? - Kisker. that's Denman.
and who's that? - I know their names.
they're missing, Mr. Spaly.
okay, look, I came up.
I went to my locker and I got my stash.
all right, I was-- I lost
track of time, but I wasn't gone
from down there more than an hour!
so you saw the men in the southeast quadrant an hour before the collapse?!
this entire operation has been focused
on 2b in the se quad based on what you told us!
they could be anywhere,
on any level!
hold the work!
stop! hold the work!
30 seconds of silence!
now! Bring the dogs back in!
Hey, we've got some banging over here!
they're down here!
let's hope the dogs aren't lying, too.
thank you for meeting with me.
what can we do for you today, Mr. Kachani?
I've read about your marriage experiments,
and I had my people do a little research into the work you do here.
okay.
long and short is, I'm about to ask
my girlfriend, Nadia, to marry me.
Oh, mazel tov. it's a good thing you're starting young.
it took my father five times to get it right.
affair, alcohol,
green card problems, affair...
so, when my company, networker, went public,
I did, uh... well.
Yeah, I'd call banking four- and-a-half billion dollars doing very well.
before I propose to Nadia,
I have to know if she loves me for the right reasons.
what makes you think she doesn't?
Nadia grew up with nothing.
her father was a short-order cook, in and out of work.
she struggled with money for whole live - Student loans, credit card debt... - So?
so, right after my company went public,
my partner's wife left him
and took their two-year-old daughter.
she used the little girl against him for a huge settlement.
so what is it you'd like us to do?
Nadia says she had no idea who I was before we met.
I just want to make sure she's telling the truth.
Dr. Lightman does deception detection
for the FBI, TSA, police...
we don't snoop
into people's personal lives.
but thanks for coming in.
your web site's incredibly useful
for reconnecting with girls who rejected me in middle school.
look, just do your boss a favor,
and make a decision after you look.
I think that's the micro expression for "holy crap."
we're dropping fiber-optic cameras into the collapsed structure,
and the crawler drills
will be boring through the debris
to create a hole through which we will then pull out them
mayor Fallon.
and we have every reason to believe that Mr. Blunt,
Mr. Denman and Mr. Kisker are alive.
and the drills are the best way to reach the men?
they've been down there for19 hours now.
we have to reach them as quickly as possible.
no expense will be spared to save them.
and I want to reiterate that
no wrongdoing has occurred in the construction on this site.
you know, I'm going to let you handle the questions.
I really need to get back to the family.
excuse me, I'm going to get back to the families.
how long have they been down there without water?
do you think you're going to find more bodies?
mayor Fallon, hi. I'm Gillian Foster.
I know who you are.
we really appreciate your help here.
Hi. Any idea how this happened?
no.
you lied when you said there was "no wrongdoing" on the site.
why was that?
Oh, that was just...
that was just what?
I pressured the green city construction
to hire more frostburg workers than they needed.
none of our men would have even been there - If it weren't for me. - How did you pressure them?
permits and zoning.
I helped them clear some bureaucratic hurdles.
I don't know what
things are like for you DC folks,
but things have gotten real bad for frostburg with the recession.
the site was going to bring
a whole new industry here;
our Silicon Valley, thousands of new jobs.
if I can help with anything else,
please call my office.
thank you.
we've got video!
there they are!
Blunt!
they're alive!
can I see that?
no. can I? Thank you.
Yeah, it's them.
it's Blunt, Denman and Kisker.
that's Kisker. His leg's crushed.
there's a lot of blood.
I can't really feel my toes.
Oh, my god. baby!
someone's got to help him.
we are trying Mrs. Kisker.
we rigged a tourniquet on it,
but he's not doing so good.
Jered, are you hurt?
I'm okay, Valerie.
we're all banged up a little,
but we're okay.
and I love you, Valerie.
all right, let's get you back
to the staging area. I will keep you updated.
I'm staying here. - I'm sorry.
we have to bring you back there
Dr. Lightman.
my men need engineers
and rescue workers, not a couple
of freak show shrinks pointing fingers.
she's the shrink.
I'm the freak show.
I'm sorry, we normally wear labels.
Hello? - Yeah, we are here
can you tell me what happened?
the sub roof just started coming down.
once we heard it, we went to the elevator shaft,
but we couldn't get there in time.
is there any way you can get over there now?
we've tried,
but the substructure floor between here and the shaft
is just too unstable, it could give out.
he's right.
we haven't even completed that substructure floor yet.
that man could bleed out down there.
we have to drill faster.
listen, guys,
I promise you, we're going to get you guys up from out of there, okay?
just sit tight.
the drill should reach you in a few hours.
we're going to do whatever it takes.
you're going to be rescued.
did you see that?
Yeah. - See what?
Hey, um, Mr. Blunt?
yeah? What is it?
Mr. Blunt, can you hear me?
we lost the feed. All right, we lost the feed.
can you trace the line?
guys, talk to me.
I need to know why we got cut off.
we've got men down there, and we need to communicate with them
can you rewind it back to the point
where they'd just been told they were going to be rescued?
just sit tight.
the drill should reach you in a few hours.
we're going to do whatever it takes.
uh, these two men
are showing joy and relief.
Yeah, freeze there.
can we push in on this man?
okay.
lips stretched.
can you pan up to the eyes?
eyelids retracted.
fear. That's concealed fear.
well, he's buried under 50 tons of concrete and steel.
what the hell were you expecting?
relief.
I don't expect a man who's just been told
he's going to be rescued to show fear,
and everyone else is showing relief.
maybe he doesn't believe he can be rescued.
post traumatic stress can stifle almost
any positive emotion.
maybe, uh...
Mr. Blunt doesn't want to be rescued.
who wouldn't want to be rescued?
someone enclose a collapse in the first place.
you think Blunt might've intentionally caused the collapse?
well, that would explain the look of fear.
best explanation we've got.
this is unbelievable.
how long has Jered Blunt worked for you, Mr. Warren?
about six months.
any problems?
did he threaten violence against the company?
Yeah, he confronted me a few times.
in fact, he sent a threatening letter to my office, - Complaining about overtime.- why didn't you fire him?
well, believe me, I tried. The union blocked.
why would Blunt
sabotage the building while he was still inside it?
well, maybe he got trapped down there.
can you replay the video again?
okay.
we're up.
we're all banged up a little, but we're okay.
and I love you, Valerie.
wait, freeze it! freeze it!
look at that.
there's charring on the concrete.
burn marks from an explosion.
damn.
what's wrong?
blunt could have used
explosives to try to blow up the building.
that could have caused the collapse.
if he did this,
he could be trying to sabotage
our rescue efforts, too.
there could be more explosives down there.
what about my other guys?
we need to get them out of there.
they're trapped right here,
in the northwest quadrant.
if they can get across to the elevator shaft here, - They'd be protected from another explosion.- No way.
this floor's too unstable to get there. they never make it
we're getting ready to send rescue workers down there.
if there are under donated explosives,
I can't move forward.
Dr. Lightman, can you find out from Blunt if he
did this so we know if it's safe to get these man down there
if you get the live feed back up,
I can talk to workplace
we have to get it back up then.
we won't get anything from Blunt that way.
he's not going to admit to when he's still down there with his crew.
then what the hell are we going to do?
cause we're just wasting time here,
and Kisker's down there bleeding.
violence in the workplace
correlates to domestic violence.
a guy doesn't blows up a building
without that anger spilling over at home.
we should talk to his wife.
my father would have been proud of these men.
when he was mayor, it was his dream
to try to bring industry to our city,
and we're fulfilling that dream.
and I am proud of our strength in this difficult time.
and once we get the men out...
excuse me. is Valerie Blunt here?
...We'll rely on each other to get through this...
thank you.
...just as we always have.
I know you're concerned, and I'll take questions
one at a time. please...
we met in high school.
I was a cheerleader and Jered was
a third-string running back.
ridiculous, right?
but we fell in love.
are you still in love?
of course.
I mean, you know, it's...
it's not perfect; it's...
it's a marriage.
I can't believe this happened after everything in the company,
you and your husband have been through a lot?
uh, no.
no, no. I just mean, um...
with how hard it is to find work around here for anyone.
maybe he's just crazy.
what?
your husband, maybe he's just bonkers.
Wha... what are you talk-- I don't know...
he was arguing with the company,
he was constantly getting into fights, right?
what my partner is dancing around here is
that we think your husband just lost it
and blew up the building.
Jered would never do that.- What are you doing?
this isn't appropriate.
there's something she's not telling us.
we're wasting time.- I'm sorry.
I'm sick of watching you coddle these women.
well, I'm sick of you derailing this investigation.
you know, you can be a bitch sometimes.
who the hell are you people?!
stay away from me!
you almost didn't sell it.
I'm going to have to hit you harder next time.
you know, you take a little bit too much pleasure
Valerie Blunt was disgusted when you slapped me,
but she wasn't afraid.
she showing no heightened sensitivity to violence
between a man and a woman.
I think it's unlikely she was abused.
so you don't think her husband could have blow up what it is?
with no violence at home? It's hard to believe.
it's Loker. Give me a second.
yeah?
take it.
Yeah. Yeah.
what was that? A job? - Yeah.
you going to tell me what it is?
I don't need your permission to take on a case.
that depends on the case, doesn't it really?
it'll be fine, I promise.
that usually means I'm getting screwed.
usually.
isn't that the head of green city construction?
Warren? With Mrs. Blunt?
less than a foot and a half between them
a flash glance from her before a quick turn away.
they've been intimate before.
you know, Walerie Blunt
was hiding something when you asked
if she and her husband had problems, eyelids fluttered.
there was something she didn't want to say.
maybe her husband wasn't the perpetrator.
maybe he was the target.
so Warren sleeps with Blunt's wife,
and then buries him alive?
if you would think I would have
anything to do with this, you are completely
out of your mind. Why would I sabotage
my own job, my own company?
for, for woman? And I got
ten guys on this crew at least who can tell you
exactly where I've been on this site every minute of the last three days.
I haven't been down to the substructure for weeks.
but you and Mrs. Blunt had an affair, right?
it wasn't an affair.
they were separated at the time.
and he'd hardly spoken to her for six months before they broke up.
why did your relationship end?
I just wasn't into it anymore.
you know, I told her
I just wasn't really feeling it, you know?
that's a lot of anger you're showing
for a woman you don't care about.
men usually reserve that kind of
anger for women they love.
I don't know why it ended, okay?
I thought we were on cloud nine.
we both felt like we were kids again.
we were out to dinner one night,
she got a phone call from Blunt;
she spoke to him for about five minutes and she bolted out of the restaurant, I don't know.
she went running back to him, just like that, so...
you believe him?
well, he's pretty confident about his alibi.
and he used similes and metaphors when he was talking about Valerie Blunt.
we were on cloud nine. We felt like kids again.
people don't use that kind of language when they're lying.
what do you think Blunt told her
that brought he be contempt.
there's something going on between them.
and we still don't know why he showed fear when he
found out he was going to be rescued.
I need to know what else Loker found on the footage.
it's hot down here,
but there's still air.
can we zoom in on his left cheek and forehead, Sylvia?
Oh, there's that thing again. - What is that?
contempt? - Could be contempt.
its unilateral.
I need to borrow Michael. We're going to go meet
our billionaire's girlfriend, Nadia Dawson.
easy, tiger. She's only into guys making ten figures.
maybe she really loves him.
Yeah, right.
what makes you so sure?
the female hanging fly.
what?
the female hanging fly.
she'll only mate with a male when he brings her a caterpillar as a food offering.
the bigger the offering, the more time she will have inte cost with him
for insects, it's food.
for us, it's money.
she's a female hanging fly.
okay, you need to get out more.
look, I don't care if she's into him for his money,
as long as she is up front about it from the beginning.
Yeah, well, it's not always so easy to be open about money.
I always tell women exactly how much I have in the bank on the first date.
and you wonder why you never get a second.
good luck.
Dr. Lightman's on the line.
so it's a contraction of Blunt's orbicularis, corrugator
and frontalis muscles.
I'm thinking contempt.
maybe he did try to bring down the building after all.
no, that's not contempt.
well, what is it?
Mr. blunt's a very sick man.
I wouldn't feel too well either if I were buried under a building.
no. he was sick long before he was buried.
almost got the feed back up.
how's your husband?
how'd you know...?
don't do that.
can you still hear us?
Yeah.
we hear you. - Got it.
how's Mr. Kisker?
he's not good.
you need to get us out of here.
Mr. Blunt, I need you to tell us something.
what is it?
on the video footage we got of you back here,
I noticed something a little peculiar.
you have a rippling contraction of your facial muscles.
I don't understand.
well, you haven't been well, have you?
what do you mean? - Your muscle contraction
is a symptom of late-stage multiple sclerosis.
no. I don't know what you're talking about.
when you and your wife were separated
something that you told her over the phone
brought her running back to you.
are you sick?
Mr. Blunt,
it's okay.
Mr. Blunt, your friend could bleed to death.
I never meant for any of this to happen.
but we got no savings.
I don't have insurance.
doctors say I got... I got a few years.
I didn't want to leave Valerie with nothing.
when you were told you were gonna be rescued,
you looked scared.
what were you afraid we were going to find out?
I was working near the elevator shaft.
my hands have been shaking a lot, and I...
I didn't, um...
I was trying to hold on to my blowtorch
and I couldn't and it fell...
from b-1, two floors down to b-3.
the tank must have exploded.
I didn't realize I was putting you guys in danger, I swear.
hello. Can I help you?
are you Nadia Dawson?
Yes.
Hi. I'm Christina Lopez.
I was three years behind you in North Columbus.
you played softball for Ms. Sleevi?
pitcher, right?
Yeah.
Yeah. She always said you had the best pickoff move.
that is so funny.
are you staying here at the hotel...
uh... I'm sorry, what was it, Christina?
Yeah. I was just here for a meeting.
you been working here a long time?
almost a year.
it turns out Georgetown
actually wants you to pay for classes, so...
how weird running into someone from N. C. high-- here.
ms. Sleevi would always say, "you got four bases,
three strikes, two teams, but only one winner."
so what brought you to d. c?
um, well, my boyfriend started a company that's based here.
it's one of those
social internet sites the kids are into.
Oh, which one?
it's called Networker.
you're dating the founder of Networker?
Yeah.
wow, how'd that happen?
what do you mean?
I mean, it's just a long way from North Columbus.
Yeah, I guess so.
how'd you meet him?
Yeah, it's the funniest thing.
I obviously had heard of the company,
but I had no idea who he was.
I just saw this adorable guy standing right here at the bar trying to get a drink.
Yeah, that is funny.
it must be strange to come from North Columbus
and now to be dating someone so well off.
take a look at this, Mr. Kachani.
you got four bases, three strikes,
two teams, but only one winner.
that's Nadia telling the truth.
she's talking with her hands,
what we call illustrators.
but when she's asked if she knew who you were when you met...
Yes, the funniest thing.
I'd obviously heard of the company,
but I had no idea who he was.
I just saw this adorable guy standing there at the bar.
no more illustrators.
her hands are in her lap.
it must be strange coming from North Columbus and now to dating someone so well off.
instead, she touches her watch and... her earring.
manipulators.
when you see illustrators decrease
and manipulators increase-- scratching, licking the lips,
or in this case, touching jewelry, it's a sign of lying.
I can't believe this.
whatever she told you,
she knew who you were when you met.
you have my check.
Mr. Kachani...
I don't want to see you any more. - Mr. Kachani...
I thought he was coming back in tomorrow.
he said he couldn't wait.
what did you tell him?
the truth-- she's after his money.
that's not the whole truth.
it's all he wanted to know.
Yeah, but that's not all we found out.
we're sure it was an accident?
of course it was.
we knew that our men would never intentionally
do harm to the building.
mayor Fallon is right.
we've ruled out the possibility of explosives.
should be able to reach the men within the hour.
what was the exact cause?
detonation of a blowtorch acetylene tank
dropped through the substructure by Mr. Blunt.
that man doesn't believe a word he just said.
no, he doesn't.
the specifics of the collapse pattern are consistent
with Blunt's description.
maybe he knows what really happened.
Hey, Stevens.
you got a problem.
the city engineer doesn't believe
that blowtorch caused the building to collapse.
of course he does. He said so.
the engineer is lying.
he knows something about how this collapse happened.
come on. Five minutes ago you told me Blunt caused the collapse.
who the hell am I supposed to believe?
well, I'll tell you who not to believe.
that guy.
I've been in love with the same woman for 30-plus years...
...the same woman for 30-plus years...
thanks for coming back in, Mr. Kachani.
I don't understand why I'm here.
well, the fact that Nadia knew who you were before you met
isn't the only thing we learned when I talked to her.
okay.
look at this.
...and the way he hates breakfast food,
and how frustrated he gets in traffic.
I don't know, I just love everything about him.
I... I want to spend the rest of my life with him.
there.
that's an illustrator.
there she is telling the truth.
she does love you, and your money.
you're lying to yourself if you
think you can separate the two
she lied to me.
well, why are you in love with Nadia?
she's charming, she's intelligent and...
Oh, wait for it...
she's beautiful.
how's her beauty any different from your money?
I don't know.
exactly.
just be honest with her.
and yourself.
and get a prenup.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I didn't shrug my shoulders.
Yeah, you don't believe the blowtorch caused the explosion, - Do you, Mr. Boulware? - Yes, I do.
what's he doing?
11 beats every five seconds.
that's 132 beats per minute.
what are you talking about?
your carotid artery is pulsing 132 beats per minute.
your heart's racing.
why are you so tense?
maybe you found something in your inspections
that could have caused the collapse.
I didn't find anything.
now that's the truth.
now you're telling the truth.
so I'm thinking, maybe you didn't find anything,
because you didn't do the proper inspections.
there are three men trapped
underneath us.
and if you know there's a problem
and something happens to them
it's going to be your fault.
my wife and I were three payments behind on our mortgage.
we were gonna get foreclosed.
I don't know where the hell - The money came from. - Money?
and a note.
from who? - I don't know.
it just said to skip the inspections
and sign off on the approvals.
well, why would someone pay you off?
what was it they didn't want you to find?
look, usually these inspections are pro forma.
I'm sure someone just wanted to move things along faster.
Mr. boulware, you don't believe that's all it is.
now you're minimizing-- you're playing down
your responsibility for what's gone wrong.
you don't want to admit how big a risk you really took with these men's lives.
but you need to tell us, what is the worst thing
somebody could be trying to hide on this site?
there.
there.
what were you thinking?
soon as the drills allow us to pull them through,
we're gonna get your husband out of there.
please. He's everything.
just get him out of there.
Hey, Stevens! You have to.
we will, Mrs. Blunt, I promise. Stevens!
you have to stop the drilling.
what are you talking about?
tell him.
we can't drill-- there could be methane gas down there.
methane? If there's methane down there, blunt's blowtorch
could've ignited it, causing the explosion.
the drills could set off another one!
environmental testing was done on this site months ago.
there's no signs of any gas.
no, he took a bribe; proper inspections weren't done.
what? I went back over
the old geologic surveys.
decades ago, this entire area was a landfill,
and there could be methane seeping up from it.
how could you have signed off without the inspections?
just stop the drills and do the testing!
methane testing takes hours.
these men have been trapped for almost a full day.
one man is dying down there.
we could lose him while we do this testing.
someone paid this man not to do his job.
you don't care who or why?
I'll let the cops deal with him.
I'm not wasting any more time.
I am saving these men; we are drilling.
eight to one. What? Eight to one.
average ratio of firefighter deaths in the U. S.
compared to every other country with the same training,
effectiveness and equipment. So what?
we have a hero complex in this country.
our firefighters rush in too quickly,
trying to live up to the expectation that they're heroes,
and more of our men get killed.
step back.
and that is an order!
now!
almost! Ten more feet!
power up to 800 rpm's!
you guys all right?
it's hard to breathe-- the air's getting thick.
is that the methane?
it could explode; the drills could set it off.
you got to tell me what's going on.
this is the city engineer.
I think there's a pool of methane
seeping up from underneath you.
methane?
is there any place they can get to where they'll be safer?
you need to try to get to the elevator shaft.
you need to go now.
come on, Blunt!
tell my wife... I love her.
if the drills hit that methane...
we got to stop the drilling.
stop the drilling!
stop the drilling!
I don't hear anything!
I got nothing!
can you hear me?
Yes! yes! We got one!
come on, come on.
where is he?
Where's Jered?
blunt let us go first.
he didn't make it into the shaft, and, uh...
fires...
sorry.
I'm so sorry.
FBI is here.
what do you want to do?
you talk, I'll watch, okay?
okay. - Okay?
Kevin Warren?
Yeah. You have the right to remain silent. What?
anything you say or do can be used against you.
are you kidding me? Wh-what is this?
you found out there was methane underneath this site,
and you knew it would derail this project.
that's crazy. And you tried to bribe
the city engineer to sign off without proper inspections.
I would never do anything to risk my guys' lives.
and if there was methane, I didn't know about it.
that's the truth.
I know you didn't,
because you showed true surprise when you were accused.
everybody here was surprised,
outraged...
except for one.
one person was relieved.
when a guilty person
sees someone accused of the crime that they committed...
they show relief.
your father tried to bring a factory to frostburg when he was mayor, and he couldn't.
is that how you found out about the methane?
I never thought anything like this could happen.
I didn't. I didn't.
we needed the jobs.
I'm sorry.
Hey.
I thought you could use a real drink.
and a bath. mm,
well, I can't help you with that.
why do people always think
they're the only one with a secret?
human nature, of course.
if the man has told the truth
or Blunt...
had been honest about his illness...
hmm, none of this would've happened.
if the lies... hadn't come together.
they always do.
the following story is fictional and does not depict any actual person or event 10 years ago
Oh, I'm so sorry. Sorry.
uh, I wasn't paying attention.
are you okay?
Yeah.
I, uh...
no.
not really. I...
I just lost a patient.
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.
I'm-I'm studying to be a nurse.
I was just gonna go grab some coffee, uh, clear my head.
somebody help me!
help me, please!
somebody help me!
it seems that a copycat of serial rapist Andrew Jenkins is on the loose.
andrew Jenkins has been serving consecutive life sentences at Utley State Penitentiary for more than a decade.
now, Jenkins abducted, blinded and then raped 12 women in the '90s.
in the past three months, six more women have been abducted, blinded and raped.
so what does Andrew Jenkins know about these new crimes?
when will this copycat be caught?
and what is being done to stop him?
what's up, bitch?
does anybody want to tell me why Mr. Genius is ignoring the guy he's here to talk to?
I mean, what is he waiting for?
andrew Jenkins is a highly skilled pathological liar.
if we come at him head on, we'll get nothing.
if Jenkins has intel on the copycat, it'd be good to get it before another woman gets abducted.
Lightman wants Jenkins to make the first move, and he will.
and what if he gets made?
he won't.
agent Reynolds, if you didn't think we could do the job, why did the FBI bring us on the case?
look, I've interviewed Jenkins five times and I got zero on the copycat.
so let me put it this way.
I don't believe in holistic medicine, but if the chemo's not working,
I'll give acupuncture a shot.
Hey, man, you need a hand?
I think acupuncture's about to pay off.
Hello?
if you change your mind, just give me a yell.
name's Andrew Jenkins.
progress.
patience is not one of your virtues, is it, Agent Reynolds? No.
is that Jenkins' fan mail?
ten years of sickos and freaks worshipping him.
all right, take it all back to the office.
odds are good the copycat's in there somewhere.
good luck.
heard about you on TV.
you're that-- you got that copycat, right?
swelling chest, chin up, smile.
that's pride.
I don't get it, myself.
I mean, you're just another pervert who can't close.
is that who I am?
what happens, you just, you get... you get queasy when it comes time to finish, is that it?
what are you in for?
I got an ex-wife, who sometimes doesn't let me see my kids.
and a cop took her side.
and a jury said that I killed him.
this, um, this cop...
does he jerk awake every morning with your name on his lips?
is your face the last thing he sees every night before he falls asleep?
when he meets someone new, hears the horror in their voice, who does your cop think of?
Oh, wait.
that's-that's right.
he's not thinking of anyone.
take your point.
thought you might.
what's on your mind?
nothing.
Oh, come on.
ask.
I don't get it.
I mean, I don't, I-I, I don't get it.
why'd you have to blind them?
I mean, it seems a bit excessive, you know?
Oh, come on, that's an easy one.
no eyes, they can't identify me after.
how'd you get caught, then?
busted tail light.
I had a girl in the trunk.
almost talked my way out of it, even with her screaming back there.
you-you're that good, are you?
Yeah.
but you aren't.
excuse me?
different costume, same game.
now you've lost me.
who are you?
cause you're not a cop killer.
that's what I keep telling my lawyer.
no.
you're a fraud.
who sent you in here?
special Agent Reynolds?
Ah, damn it!
alert the guards in the laundry.
we got a situation.
Lightman's supposed to be reading Jenkins.
it looks like it's the other way around to me.
I-I've never seen anyone read Lightman who hasn't had deception training.
I-I don't know what happened.
well, it was worth a shot.
Cal Lightman. How do you do?
and you want to know what I know about my friend, the copycat.
Yeah, something like that, yeah.
how come nobody's tried to bribe me?
what would it take?
all good.
it's very civil - right.
what would it take?
you know what I like?
chocodiles.
I'd like a box a week.
all right, it's a deal.
Yeah, I'm gonna need that in writing.
you made a deal with a pathological lying serial rapist for Chocodiles?
who's the copycat?
well, you get an A for effort.
and effort should be rewarded.
3748 Woodlawn Road.
good luck.
what happened?
Jenkins played you, that's what happened.
and while you were signing a contract for snack cakes,
Camille Halpern was being abducted from this house.
so Jenkins didn't lead us to the rapist.
he led us to another victim.
all right, this is single mom Camille Halpern.
if form holds, the copycat will toy with her the first 24 hours, and then he'll blind her and rape her.
and we're already down three hours.
what's he do before he blinds them?
he ties them up, gags them and forces them to watch videos of his previous victims.
so right now, Camille is watching what he's gonna do to her.
Yeah, if we don't get to her first.
well, Cube's ready.
nobody talks to Jenkins but me. We clear?
I pulled strings all over D. C. to get this bastard in here.
so I sure hope that this plan is a lot more successful than your last one.
at least we know Jenkins is connected to the copycat.
that's more than you found out the last three months.
now, I told you where to find him.
you just got there late.
agent Ben.
thanks for the hall pass.
Hi, Foster.
follow me.
Oh, somebody doesn't like me talking to his lady.
I got to call the deputy director with the great news.
that's the guy that out-Lightman'd Lightman?
so now what?
you make the puppet dance?
what?
I called Natalie Wright, the woman attacked two weeks ago.
she's a wreck, but she's the only copycat victim willing to talk to me.
I thought I might be able to get some detail that could help us with our new victim.
so I'll be on my cell.
if you need me.
no, 'cause normally, you add "if you need me."
you're pissed, right? Because you think
I blew it at the prison, right?
I'm not blaming you.
well, you're angry.
because Jenkins is loving this.
I mean, this is the best day he's had in over a decade.
he's out of jail, he's getting all this attention.
we are fulfilling his every fantasy.
by "we," you mean me.
is that it?
so you're a big deal, huh?
fancy offices, bevy of fine ladies.
real step up from cell block two.
do you know who the copycat is?
no.
what's your mom's name?
Gina. No, it's Margaret.
where were you born?
Georgia.
no, Nebraska.
Where'd you go to school?
didn't.
so you don't count flunking out of, uh, Southern Iowa State after one semester then?
what the hell is he doing?
I'm concentrating. Hey!
I could be following up on ten different leads right now.
so you're gonna explain why this isn't Jenkins taking one more useless polygraph test. Wow.
okay, where should I even start?
I'm monitoring heart rate, skin temperature, perspiration, vocal stress, blood pressure
which doesn't even begin to cover what Lightman is seeing in there, and what the cameras are...
all right, all right, enough.
who's the copycat?
don't know.
would you tell me if you did?
sure. We're pals.
Hey, how's it going?
Jenkins is lying about everything.
he won't let us establish a baseline of what he looks like when he's telling the truth.
Hey, looks like I found somebody suspicious in the fan mail.
every week this guy sends disgustingly graphic drawings of Jenkins' crimes.
let me see that.
well, it's one sick puppy, but that's not our guy.
and how can you know that?
I can know that because he's fantasizing about past actions.
you want to look for somebody who's making plans for the future.
let me see that.
how is it I'm the unpaid intern and you're the highly paid professional?
Hey, you're the one Lightman's got sitting in the front row.
so... I'll just put this in the "No" pile.
who's the copycat?
who's the girl?
you're a distraction. I had to ask Loker a question, and you've got me reading all this fan mail.
and what, so you're above that now, is that it?
no, no, it's just that you squaring off with a master liar is kind of once-in-a-lifetime.
Oh, and you think you'll learn something?
a woman gets raped, she gets blinded, but at least you've been afforded an education, is that it?
or maybe you just don't want me to see that you're struggling.
Oh, that's an interesting theory.
but incorrect.
and that fan mail you're so disdainful of
well, the guy we're looking for is in there somewhere.
and that's a fact, that's not a theory, so go find him.
Mm. "Or maybe you just don't want me to see that you're struggling.
she's very perceptive, you're little... protege.
who's the copycat?
we can do this all day.
I'm not gonna make your little machines beep.
there's no one who can stay with you?
I don't want anyone to see me.
w-well, what about your parents?
my mom is gone.
my dad was here for a few days, but it... just made things worse.
my friends do what they can.
I'm s...
I'm sorry. I-I'm sorry.
I want to help you.
I know he has another woman, but I...
I can't remember.
he said his dog was missing, and I helped him, and then...
it's just gone.
and when I try to remember, all I can think is...
no one will ever love me.
I'm... I'm 23 years old, and my life is over.
my life is over.
OK so...
this is the girl he's got right now.
any idea where he's keeping her?
no.
I'll take that as a yes, then.
uh, DC?
Maryland?
Virginia?
the home for bad boys was in Maryland.
you probably know that.
you know, you'd think I'd have all kinds of horror stories, but it was actually nice.
had a dog.
some of the guys from gen pop get to train seeing-eye dogs.
I signed up for it once; didn't get picked.
why do you think that is?
you see, that was weird.
that was, 'cause that was the truth.
why the sudden honesty?
am I boring you? Is that it?
it's too easy?
Lightman-- it's an interesting name.
I've been called a... Light Bringer myself.
you see, there you go again, that was the truth.
might be getting somewhere.
here's something else that's true.
I'm never... gonna tell you who the copycat is.
okay.
okay.
Hey, Torres.
do any of, uh, Jenkins' fans refer to him as "Light Bringer"?
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, one guy.
um, it stood out to me, 'cause I went to Catholic school.
light Bringer's another name for the Devil.
it's here in the "No" pile.
what am I missing? Pathological liars like pushing boundaries.
Jenkins has been in that box all night-- he's bored.
he's flirting with the truth. By telling you the copycat's pet name for him?
yeah that person call him light bringer is very important for him somehow
he's important enough that when the truth starts coming out, it's the first person he thinks of. Here, got it.
Milo Dodds.
thank you.
you've been writing to Jenkins for years.
in fact, you've written more letters than anyone.
we counted.
is that illegal?
what do you know about the copycat?
it's on the news.
that's an evasion.
he's hiding something.
Oh, yeah, and what are you hiding, Milo, hm?
is it a woman?
is it Camille Halpern?
the mother of a two-year-old little boy?
I'm not hiding anything.
that's a masking smile.
that's bad, that is.
so, tell me this.
what's your favorite part?
is it the sizzle of the acid as you pour it into her eyes?
or is it the blood dripping down her cheek?
blood, you like that?
blood flowing? Blood?
I didn't do anything.
where is she?
I don't know. You sick son of a...
where is she? Where?! Where?! I don't know!
Whoa! Whoa! No!
in the room, in the room, in the room, in the room.
what room?
I didn't take her
I just cut out the article.
I'm a collector.
work with me, Milo.
come on, work with me! I didn't do it.
he's not the guy; let him go.
Hey! Hey!
three
he's not the guy! Aah!
two... Let him go!
look. Look, look, look.
one... Look, look.
what the hell?
he's a hemo-phobe.
he...
he's afraid of blood.
and how would you know that?
when you started talking about blood, he got woozy.
he... He got short of breath.
he's not the guy.
he couldn't even give the girl a paper cut.
so another dead end.
well...
no, not exactly.
well, Milo Dodds didn't work out.
it's like bring him here and go through his sicko memorabilia.
hopefully, we'll find some new suspects.
well, Jenkins is amazing.
you know, in-in kind of an evil way.
I mean, he's, like, dark Lightman.
Ooh, rewind.
there.
look at how he's folding the laundry.
Jenkins comes up, and he slows down.
he's concentrating too hard; it's a dead giveaway.
he did screw up.
couple of months ago, you wouldn't have noticed that.
but now that you apparently know everything you think.
it's more important to prove that I screwed up than find a missing woman, is that it?
no, I wasn't trying... We-we were just trying to establish a baseline for Jenkins.
Yeah, well, forget it.
can you go back? Run it back?
push in on the guard.
all right.
zoom in.
and let it play.
...what I know about my friend, the copycat.
you see the nostril flare?
quick intake of breath.
when he thought Jenkins was gonna open up about the copycat he panicked.
like he was afraid of getting caught.
the guard's the copycat.
could he have gotten to Camille before you?
Hey, where's the guard? Where's, uh, Calvo?
Oh, his shift ended a while ago.
they're here.
it's been 11 years since her attack, and she's doing well now. Okay.
I can do this.
okay, I just want you two to talk.
you know, maybe she can help you remember something.
but don't push yourself.
okay?
okay. Okay.
Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi.
thanks for coming. Come on in. Sure.
careful.
uh, I want you to meet Michelle Russell and her husband Paul.
Hi.
Hi, Natalie.
you know, we can do this all day.
you know, it's over for you, Calvo, you understand that, right?
so just tell me where Camille is, and I'll get the D. A. to cut you a break.
it'll make me sick, but I'll do it, for you.
it's a one-time offer, Calvo.
one time!
Hey.
he's not your guy.
he's not your guy.
what the hell are you doing? He is the guy!
no, no. He-He showed shame.
psychopaths never show shame.
Calvo called in sick four times in the last year.
and each time, the day after one of the copycat's victims was released.
and that's not a coincidence. No, no.
I think it's very important.
but he's not your guy.
it has to be him!
look, every time he takes another woman, and every time a kid loses the mother they once had and gets back a...
an empty shell, I think to myself, "This is the last one. No more."
and every time, I've been wrong, but I know
I'm right about this. Okay.
okay. Who did you lose? Who?
did you lose your mum or...
what?
did you... You lost someone? Hey. Hey.
don't use that stuff with me, okay?
he is the guy!
good news is, I think he can lead us to the rapist.
but you got to stop yelling at him.
okay?
I appreciate you both making the time.
Natalie needed to know that her life isn't over.
Oh, it helps Michelle, too.
talking to other victims.
testifying at Jenkins' parole hearing.
it's her way of fighting back.
she went to the parole hearing?
that must have been tough.
Oh, she handled it better than I did.
I took a shot at the guy.
Oh, excuse me. Sure.
where is she?
she's right here, to the right.
okay. Um, she said there were no sounds where she was kept.
nothing at all from the outside.
like she was kept underground?
I'll let Agent Reynolds know that.
okay, well, we're going to keep talking. I'll try to get more.
thank you.
Tony, let me explain something to you, okay?
Dr. Lightman is the best friend you have in the world right now.
he says that you're not the copycat.
he says that you may be a victim, too.
now, sit down.
okay, now, Jenkins made you deliver letters to the copycat.
am I right?
how?
OK. The copycat's victims.
did he bribe you?
did he threaten you?
so, he threatened you.
a shiv in the side?
not now, Torres.
he threaten your family?
I got two little girls, man.
you think you can match him, but you can't.
I was there. I saw him with you.
he's better than you.
well, if he was better than me,
I wouldn't have been able to find you, would I?
and I can protect your family.
whatever it takes.
all right, look, Calvo.
this is the girl he's got now.
you helped him take her.
now, help us save her.
he gave me the letter. He said if I didn't deliver it, he'd come after my little girls.
so, you just did what he asked?
first, it was once in a while.
I would take the letter and put it underneath the heavy trash can at Grant Park.
but I never see no one pick them up.
this is Reynolds.
I need a surveillance team.
hurry up! And then, suddenly...
Jenkins' crime spree began all over again.
those were my little girls, man.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. Listen,
if you come through for us with this,
I'll put you and your whole family in protective custody by the end of the day.
he gave me another letter today, man.
he gave you a letter today?
while you were here?
no, it couldn't be. We were watching him every second.
there's no cameras in your bathroom, man.
that was hours ago.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, get a unit over to Grant Park right now.
and if anybody even goes near a trash can, you grab them.
you understand me?
Hey, Jenkins? Jenkins.
we got Calvo now.
we know about the letter.
so, we are going to find your little friend.
good reading, that letter.
might have mentioned a friend of yours.
thank you.
meeting Michelle, it really helped.
I'm glad.
you did some amazing work today, Natalie.
I'll visit you tomorrow, okay?
can I give you a hug? Mm-hmm. Okay.
thank you, Gillian.
good night.
Hey!
no...
I d... I didn't see him.
okay... He went that way. I just...
Ooh, you look good in black and blue.
Yeah, well, we're quite a pair.
Reynolds had a team scour the area, but he was gone
Jenkins was instructing him.
he was passing notes through one of the guards.
I told you I was going to Natalie's house right outside the door to the Cube.
he must have heard us.
I'm sorry, love.
he wouldn't have gone this far unless you were under his skin.
not worth it.
you get hit, and it's okay?
I get hit, and suddenly, it's time to throw in the towel?
you got to spend some time with one of these victims.
then you tell me it's not worth it.
it's Torres.
Hey.
Hey. How's Foster? Is she okay?
well, yeah. She's okay.
thank God.
so, I got an idea.
I want to bring in Michelle, one of the victims that Foster's been working with.
get her to talk to Jenkins.
absolutely not.
look, Jenkins gets off on the pain of his victims.
maybe a face to face will get him excited, get him to give up something.
Oh, what? So you think that you can get more out of him than I can?
you're pretty confident, aren't you?
Camille's got less than 11 hours before this guy makes her feel sorry she's alive.
it's worth a shot.
he'll demolish you. Forget it.
Lightman just hung up on me.
he wouldn't even listen.
but I'm right.
Hey, whatever you're thinking about doing, don't.
I need your help.
Yeah, I kind of figured that.
I'm Ria Torres.
Lightman's little protege.
has he given up on the game already?
he had another appointment.
but somebody else wanted to stop by.
remember me?
number 12.
pink scrubs.
does your boss know you arranged this little reunion?
Yeah, he left it in a note I found underneath the trash can.
who is the copycat?
you would have made a great nurse.
what's your mother's name?
what is this? What's happening in there?
it's Torres' idea.
she thought Jenkins might crack if he was confronted with one of his victims.
and no, Lightman doesn't know about it.
is it working?
his skin temperature is rising.
he's definitely aroused.
and that was totally not the right thing to say.
I should be on the other side of this glass.
she shouldn't be alone.
who is the copycat?
I don't know.
where did you spend your twelfth birthday?
you could have at least come up with some different questions.
keep going, Michelle.
who is the copycat?
Dr. Lightman.
get out. Get out.
ria, what's going on?
daddy's home. Get out.
now. All right.
I'm Cal Lightman.
I think what you're doing is very brave, but I'm going to take over from here.
all right.
I told you not to... We've only got six hours.
what did I say? What did I say?!
what did I say?! I told you!
I told you not to do this!
she wanted to face him.
this has got nothing-- nothing-- to do with what she wants!
do you hear me?! Now, get back to work!
get back to work!
spicy, that one.
now, the attack on my colleague was, uh, stupid.
now, you played your hand.
failed, by the way.
if at first you don't succeed, try, try again.
you know, he's still learning, that one.
but you're not just mad at me, are you?
Mmm. You're mad at her.
she showed you up.
No! No, no, no, no, no. Whoa, no, no. We're good.
all good. All good.
the copycat isn't copying anymore.
they found Camille Halpern.
she's dead.
the attack on Foster
was predictable.
I should have seen that coming.
can't always be one step ahead.
Yeah, but I'm a man of science.
shouldn't have lost it like that.
you were trying to show off for your little protege.
show you were still Number One.
but you got carried away, and...
now she's walking all over you.
and I suppose your protege wouldn't act out like that, right?
he's comparing me to the copycat.
short leash.
that's the key.
when I first met Torres, she was screening carry-ons at the airport for 12 bucks an hour.
now barely four months later, she's breaking up with me.
maybe she likes me better.
no, I'm not talking about romance here.
this is the third phase of the mentor-protege relationship-- separation.
phase one-- initiation, establishing shared interests.
like falling in love.
phase two's even better.
mutual growth, high productivity.
could go on for years.
and then one day, the protege surpasses the mentor.
he closed.
Jenkins' heart rate is through the roof.
he's not a happy camper.
murder's all over the news.
he's even got a nickname.
he's the "Capital Killer."
he's more famous than you are now, so...
I should tell you,
Lightman asked me to get those photos made when we first discovered that Camille was missing.
so Camille's not dead?
we don't know yet.
Lightman knew from the beginning it was all a setup.
he planned the whole thing, all of it.
even letting Jenkins see through him at the prison.
Yeah, he set up a false power dynamic
build Jenkins' confidence, lower his defenses.
Lightman played me, too.
he pushed me to disobey him, 'cause he knew it would trigger Jenkins.
the long con.
one of Lightman's favorite moves.
you knew?
no idea.
he is scary good.
seems like I'm not the only one going through a breakup.
too bad.
june would have been four years.
the fruit and flowers anniversary.
he just gave us a time frame for the initiation.
well, thank you.
for what?
for what?!
the truth.
hey fanboy
I need to know if something big happened in Jenkins' life, in June, four years ago.
um, his parole hearing.
I was there. I taped the whole thing.
okay, I'm here at Andrew Jenkins' first parole hearing.
in just moments, Jenkins himself is going to walk into the room.
this is just weird.
I had to spend the day with him.
there's got to be something on this tape.
there's Michelle and her husband.
can you imagine having to sit there and look at the guy that did that to your wife?
that's Milo's fan club.
it has to be one of them.
well, they might be working together as a team.
nice.
go back.
stop it there.
and on the husband.
and freeze it.
all right, Torres, what do you see?
uh, something weird about his anger towards Jenkins.
Yeah, onset's too fast.
what does that mean?
real anger starts more slowly and then builds.
fake anger has a more jagged onset.
comes in stages.
and after the fake anger, adulation.
Oh, my God.
husband's a fan.
do you know where Paul is?
he, um, he checks on his empty listings every night.
he's a real estate agent.
can we, uh, can we have his addresses?
what's going on?
paul Russell is not your husband's real name.
it's Leo Carter. He changed it six years ago before you met.
I-I don't understand.
we found letters he wrote to Andrew Jenkins in prison.
he wanted to tell him how much he hated him.
how he hurt me.
no. They were-- they were fan letters.
from before you two even met.
that's not possible.
Michelle, we really... No.
he sought you out to be close to Jenkins, and to be close to what Jenkins did to you.
so, um, so all those nights where he told me that I should talk about-about what happened, that it would help me, you're saying that he would...
he was enjoying it?
Michelle, you can help us find Camille.
in time.
the listings are in the drawer next to the desk.
all right.
all right... Well, there's over 20 houses here.
have you got enough men to get to all of them?
we only have to find the one.
now Foster said underground, right?
that means the place would have a basement and an attached garage so that he could drive right in.
houses shouldn't be too close together.
and he'd prefer a young, busy neighborhood.
the more going on, the less people notice.
63 Meadow Lane. McLean, Virginia.
let's go.
it's all right. You're safe now.
stop! Freeze!
go home.
you used me.
you made it easy.
how did you know how to get to Jenkins?
in prison, the first time I asked him about the copycat, he showed pride.
also there was just the faintest hint of anger.
so I knew he resented his protege.
right. The kind of thing only you would notice.
Yeah, well, I'm trying to teach you.
you let me think that Camille was dead.
Yeah, yeah, I did.
couldn't afford anyone knowing that any part of this was a con-- Jenkins would have read it.
Reynolds knew.
only about the photograph.
are you jealous? Really?
how long till we break up for real?
eons.
you've got loads to learn.
Hey.
this is my assistant's notion of whimsy.
very cute.
yeah?
look, I just wanted to say thank you.
hell of a job.
there's no universal signal for gratitude.
surprises some people.
well, it's a good thing I can use my words.
your boss wants to put me on a retainer.
well, even the government has a good idea once in a while
I'll make FBI cases my number one priority.
in exchange, they pay me handsomely and give me full access to federal resources.
well, good luck with that.
including you.
excuse me?
they want me to have a man with a gun around full time.
to protect the valuables, huh?
guess I can't blame them.
I mean, you guys are a bunch of scientist nerds running around poking your nose in people's faces
calling them liars.
but I am not a bodyguard.
I don't have anything like you in my toolbox.
and you're something that I clearly need.
without you, we wouldn't have found Camille Halpern in time.
Plus,
foster could have been killed today.
I said yes.
Yeah, well, I'm flattered, but I'm saying no.
no, you're not flattered.
you're angry.
but the decision's been made above your pay grade, so...
Hey, hey.
look, if this happens, I work for the FBI. I don't work for you.
you actually believe that, don't you?
welcome to the Lightman Group.
Hey, Walid.
you okay?
Yeah.
I-I didn't sleep good last night.
you can borrow my notes for the midterm.
I don't need 'em anymore.
your farecard's out.
I don't have any cash.
no fare, no ride. - I need to get on this bus.
Hey, am I going to have a problem here?
I'm just saying, my place is big enough for the both of us.
well, maybe I prefer quaint over spacious.
you furniture is old, and it's not antique.
and you got no food in the refrigerator in there.
Hey, I have condiments, thank you very much.
mustard... I saw salad dressing in there the other day.
secret service pay you enough
to support my chamepagne taste.
Oh, it's like that, huh?
Mm-hmm. Yes, it is.
what is it?
this is a great victory for god's soldiers across the world.
I can't believe this.
for the first time,
america has seen one of its own turn against it.
how could this happen here?
this was only the first of many American-born martyrs
who will attack in the days to come.
Yeah, yeah, I'm watching.
everyone's in shock, but we've
got to push for it right now.
so what do you know? - Well, it looks like
the bomber was 19-year-old Jamal Bata.
his parents converted to islam in the '60s.
they're now deceased. He has no siblings.
and he attended a mosque in northeast d. c.
right now we're talking to a friend of Bata's
who claims he couldn't get on the bus.
does the FBI have anyone in custody?
just picked up the coach of the bomber's soccer team.
he's got ties to groups on our watch list.
can I talk to him?
deputy director Messler doesn't want anyone else
in with the suspect.
well, she's got "deputy" in her title for a reason.
can you go around her?
Yeah, that sounds good,
but that's just not how this works.
Oh, yeah? How does it work?
solitary confinement, stress positions at Guantanamo?
come on, now... - Or did you guys set up a new place now
what with all the bad publicity and that?
listen, the bureau has never
supported extremination - And this administration doesn't either, okay? - Really?
Cal, if we can identify other members of the cell at the mosque,
why don't you and Torres take that.
can you get me in with him?
no guarantees.
Hey, you okay?
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.
fine. - You sure?
I'm sure, yeah.
how about you?
fine. I was going to stay home with her,
but the DOJ wants everyone in.
I didn't want her to be alone.
I would've been fine.
department of justice is a target.
that's why I'm leaving her here with you.
I have to go in, Cal.
you know, I don't see why you couldn't have
just dropped me off at Dan's.
because Dan's parents weren't home.
and the last time dan's parents weren't home...
you're lecturing me about sex?
Hey, we got... we got bigger issues here.
I wish you didn't have to go in.
it's my job. I've gotta go.
I just spoke to the director.
he must really like your work.
no one else is getting in but us.
I coached Jamal at soccer practice.
he raised money for our charity drive.
but I never recruited him as a killer.
your brother is a member of al-shabab,
one of the most radical groups in the horn of Africa.
isn't he?
last month, an FBI informant spotted Mr. Ali
with some Afghani nationals that they've been tracking.
and given his access to the bomber,
he's our prime suspect.
your setup's all wrong here.
what's all wrong?
what are you doing?
what the hell are you doing?!
what the hell are you doing?! Stop it!
it's all wrong.
what was that?
um, Deputy Messler, this is Dr. Cal Lightman.
Hi. how you doing? - He's offered to help with the suspect.
the director has cleared us to be here.
listen, I don't care who you spoke with.
all right, just get him the hell out of here.
what... you've had four hours with him.
what do you have? What do you have?
you got nothing. You got less than nothing, right?
listen, we're gonna crack this son of a bitch.
that's the kind of thinking that led to abu ghraib.
good P. R. for al Qaeda, by the way.
well done on that one.
can someone escort him out of here?
what do you expect me to do?
this is what the director wants.
you're not going to crack Mr. Ali,
because he's only showing one emotion-- fear.
he's scared because he's been caught.
Yeah, or maybe he's scared
because you threw him in a dungeon
and you threatened to render him.
the bureau doesn't render suspects.
your setup increases fear,
which puts up barriers to getting to the truth.
if you want real reliable information,
you've got to alter the conditions.
alter them how?
I want you in there...
and I want him out here.
I spoke with Jamal several times in the last month.
he's very quiet, but never angry.
the kid blew up a bus.
he was angry about something.
agent Young, do you have any idea
what these accusations will do to our community?
that's why we want to conduct
the interviews right away.
did Jamal ever express any hatred for America?
we come here to worship
not to discuss politics.
I asked the men to come here
so you could talk to them.
but you must understand, they are on guard now.
we just have a few quick questions.
excuse me.
I'm so sorry. - Sorry.
sorry. Thank you.
I want to help you find
anyone who was part of this.
well, we appreciate your time.
there's nothing more important.
Jamal Bata was a member here
aliyah for almost two years.
in that time, did anyone ever hear him
talking about violence?
no.
is there a heater on in here or something?
am I the only one who's hot?
Oh, sorry.
I'm sorry.
so you accidentally removed your head scarf?
Yeah. - And what,
you were gauging the reactions of the men?
Yes. Terrorists tend to see the world
in black and white.
we thought we might get a reaction.
okay, so this is the video capture
of the first group of men we talked to.
when I took off my head scarf
there were a lot of reactions--shock, interest.
but only one displayed this.
Oh that's some intense anger. - Yeah.
we talked to 11 groups
about 10 to 12 men each.
these are the ones who showed extreme anger.
well, any fundamentalist would show that.
it doesn't mean they're terrorists.
no, it doesn't, but it's a place to start.
I apologize for the conditions before,
but the road to tyranny is always paved
with claims of necessity, right?
I grew up in Somalia.
I know about Tyranny.
what do you know about the bombs?
hmm? Did Jamal ever tell you
anything about what he was planning to do?
I never heard him speak of it.
these men are possible suspects from the Mosque.
you know this guy?
what about him?
no, I do not.
that's the first lie you've told us.
when you spoke about Jamal before,
you were sad.
now if you'd been behind these bombings
you would have been proud of him.
I had nothing to do with the bombing.
I believe you.
I do. I believe you.
but you've got to tell us what you're hiding.
because if you don't, more children like Jamal
will be recruited by the men who did plan this.
somali children...
their parents pay us
to bring them here.
we help them get into this country.
so why were you afraid to tell us that?
the children are illegals.
so you're Smugglers-- you and this guy.
we simply try to give them better lives.
I had nothing to do with this bombing.
you think he's telling the truth?
Yeah. Well, this man's not a terrorist.
you should move on. It's a waste of time.
Oh, God.
another suicide bomber at a mall of Virginia
at least ten dead, dozens injured.
and Al Qaeda's put up another statement
saying this is just the beginning.
a few of the survivors identified the bomber.
we think he was one of the young men
we saw at the mosque.
rasheed Kahn.
I just talked to this guy this morning.
I didn't read anything off of him.
I missed him.
reporting live from Virginia Metropolitan,
where victims are being brought.
a second deadly suicide bombing,
this time at the Langley Oaks Mall
has D. C. and citizens of every city in a panic.
well, they just confirmed it,
the two bombers are members of the same mosque.
Hey, hang on a second.
there was another one.
my friends go to that mall.
how many more are there going to be?
I don't know, darling.
can we just... can we please go home?
soon.
I don't want you watching
any more of this stuff, all right?
it's got to be rough on the kid, right? - Yeah.
do you have any video yet?
no, not from the mall.
and they're still piecing together tape from the bus.
we need photographs of the two bombers interacting
with people that they knew.
people at the mosque or on the soccer field.
they want me on the scene, so...
all right, take Loker with you
we need all the video we can find.
all right, you got it.
don't beat yourself up over this, all right?
I talked to the second bomber
three hours before he went into that mall.
he killed 13 people.
I looked right at him, I didn't see anything.
I completely missed him.
you would have seen it.
you could have stopped this.
all right, 1986, I'm in Belfast for the British.
I let go of a man.
that night he walks into a pub
and he shoots six people.
three of them dead.
how'd he get by you?
sometimes they just do.
I need you focused, love.
Yeah.
this job has opened some crazy doors.
this is not one I ever wanted to walk through.
the Shrapnel Pattern's consistent
with most suicide bombs.
looks like they used nails.
the only good thing is it was a small device.
small?
there's Shrapnel Marks 100 feet down the walls.
if it was big,
there'd be no walls.
look at this.
see how the blood is sprayed down and outward?
this is where he detonated.
that's great.
I'll be outside vomiting.
wait a minute, wait a minute.
that... no, that... that doesn't make sense.
the food court is only 50 feet away.
the bomb would have been a lot more effective there.
know what?
there's no cameras covering this area.
that's probably why he did it here.
what do you see?
that camera caught it.
Nah, that's not pointed this way.
no, not directly, but it's pointed
at what used to be a mirror.
the angle's tight, but those surveillance cameras,
they have wide-angle lenses.
A. V. club in high school, huh?
I understand, Mr. Director.
Yes, I'll make sure that
Dr. Lightman has everything that he needs.
what are we looking for?
disgust.
the language of hate.
any sign on the bomber's faces
of someone that they were working with.
well, there's nothing here.
nothing on the bomber's faces,
nothing on the faces of their friends.
we need more recent photographs.
something must have changed.
Dr. Lightman,
I have the secret service on the line for you.
Yeah, uh, you must be looking for Torres.
well, what's this about?
Yeah, yeah, I'm glad that you called, too.
don't. don't.
look, I'm glad that you called, but I just can't do this, okey?
you all right?
Yeah.
I got a call from secret service.
are they worried about the White House?
no, uh, Dupree's unaccounted for.
what? Torres' boyfriend?
FBI have a chatter that malls were being targeted.
secret service was sent in to coordinate security after the first bomb.
and he was there?
he was there or he was on his way there-- it's unclear.
either way, he hasn't called in
since the blast.
all right, I'll tell her.
I don't think we should.
Cal...
she interviewed the mall bomber and she missed him.
she's not responsible.
she thinks she is.
she thinks she killed those people.
you want her to think that her boyfriend was one of them?
she'd want to know.
I've got calls in to the director of the FBI, the head of the ATF.
there are people canvassing hospitals.
there's nothing that she can do right now.
I don't know about this.
we need her focused.
Hey, you ready to go?
you okay?
Yeah. Let's go.
you need to let us go home.
we've lost our son.
your son killed a lot of people at that mall.
he worked with you here.
looks like you had some of what
he needed to build that bomb.
my son was not a radical.
rasheed would never hurt innocent people.
the family is usually the last to know.
did Rasheed have any extremist views?
he loved this country.
you're trying to make him into a mujahed.
that wasn't him.
your nephew doesn't seem to agree.
what?
shame. You're ashamed.
of course I feel ashamed.
someone so close to me hides a secret like this.
how can you not know.
Mrs. Kahn, what was Rasheed's day like?
he would wake up early for prayers...
...have breakfast, go to band practice.
after classes, he loved to edit
the school newspaper.
he volunteered at the mosque.
he did his homework.
he...
this wasn't your fault.
so that "typical day" stuff?
what was that, some kind of psych test?
radical groups prey on outcasts
disaffected kids.
rasheed should have been a loner,
but he was in the band, he worked on the newspaper,
he volunteered at the mosque.
where he could have been exposed to other radicals.
he didn't fit the profile.
doj wants us all over Rasheed Kahn's school.
that means I want to talk to every student,
every teacher, the janitors.
I want to find out who was absent that day.
I want to see if there are any substitute teachers.
can you give me a second, please?
how's Emily?
she's okay, I guess.
the second bomb shook her up a bit.
Yeah, she's not the only one.
Hey, what are your law enforcement contacts, like over at, uh, Fairfax County?
I'd say pretty good at the moment.
I need your help.
there's a guy I know in the secret service
and he was on his way to the mall, and he's gone missing.
what's his name? - Karl Dupree.
with a "K"?
Yeah. - Okay, I'm on it.
good. And you're leaving soon, aren't you?
no coffee stops. No supermarkets.
just stay out of the capital, all right?
you always did have a funny way of saying I love you.
Yeah.
how you doing, kiddo? You all right?
Yeah. Fine.
Hey, they were able to put together the tape from the bus,
and we have video from the mall.
you're going to want to take a look.
these are the two suicide bombers,
moments before detonation.
their body language is paradoxical.
could you try using smaller words that mean more?
terrorists are usually so afraid of being spotted
that the keep their heads down
and avoid making eye contact.
right. but check out the video from the bus.
Jamal's got his head up.
he's making eye contact with the other passengers.
and look at the mall bomber.
he's flirting with that woman.
he's got a classic head tilt.
he's squared his hips to face her.
he's leaning in.
maybe he pulled her in to kill her.
no, there's nothing on his face.
he's too relaxed for a suicide mission.
so you're saying he didn't know?
rasheed didn't fit the profile.
he had no history of violence.
well, that would explain why Torres didn't see
any anxiety when she talked to him.
so no anxiety...
...no determination.
these are the faces of innocents,
not suicide bombers.
you were right.
forensic analysis found that remote detonators
were used in both bombings.
those young men were victims, too.
they had no idea what they were doing.
but the terrorists wanted the
world to believe that they did.
the idea of homegrown suicide bombers
choosing to blow themselves up is a lot scarier than some foreign radical planting bombs on people.
I need you to find out who had access to both kids.
rasheed was targeted.
he had no idea that he was carrying the bomb.
that's why you couldn't read him when you were talking to him.
Yeah, but somebody planted a bomb on him,
and I might have missed them.
no, you didn't miss anything.
we need to look harder at the mosque.
go look at the tape.
any word on Dupree?
no, nothing yet.
we'll tell her when we know something new.
but she knows she's not responsible for the second bombing now.
we've had two bombs in a day. More are likely.
she's one of the few people who can actually help find these guys.
the most productive thing she can do for Dupree...
she's doing it.
okay.
Hey, what about that?
guy keeps rubbing his arm.
no, we clocked him when we were there.
arthritis. Confirmed it with his medical records.
I'm moving to Israel.
if I'm going to live somewhere
where I can get blown up in a bus or in a mall at any time,
I want beaches and I want women who speak their minds.
you don't have much of a filter, do you?
he calls it radical honesty.
it grows on you.
we go back?
what?
go back to the point when the imam walks in front of the camera.
look at his eyebrows.
they're raised and pulled together.
how in the hell did you see that?
did he seem that anxious when you talked to him?
no, nothing like that.
maybe he's just nervous about us talking to his men.
maybe it's something else.
I'm not a murderer.
see, after 9-11, I... we all struggled.
I'm from Saudi Arabia.
I studied at the same mosque as one of the hijackers.
I never believed in their brand of Islam.
and I realized that to be an American
I had to honor my country and my religion.
so I called the FBI office
and offered to help.
you were an informant?
if anyone I had concerns about came into the mosque,
I'd make a call.
deputy Messler never said anything about that.
I only work with one man.
agent Richard Squire.
do you know him? - No, not well.
he left the bureau right after
the administration turned over.
you didn't like him very much.
he took advantage.
one day, he asked me
about an argument I had with a congregant at a private ablution ceremony.
there was no way he could have known about the argument.
so he bugged the place.
audio surveillance over the ablution fountain.
here in the prayer hall, in the bathrooms.
if the FBI was willing
to do that before, you tell me, what will they do now?
so?
so the FBI has no record of any bugging.
and audio surveillance is a major operation.
the imam was telling the truth.
maybe Squire did it on his own.
well, there were a lot of cowboys after 9-11,
so it's certainly possible.
but if he did tap this mosque,
I want those tapes.
found your man Dupree.
just got off the phone with Fairfax county P. D.
they confirmed he was at the mall.
okay.
Yeah, thanks.
what?
Dupree was in the mall.
he was in the elevator when the bomb went off.
no. No.
he's alive.
he's... unconscious.
Oh, my God! - Take my car.
virginia Metropolitan.
excuse me, ma'am.
we have to get him to surgery.
how's he doing?
he's got blood in his brain.
a hematoma.
he was in an elevator for four hours.
nobody knew where he was.
what was that?
what?
that look.
did you know?
you knew he was missing?
there was nothing you could have done.
nothing I could have done...?!
Ria...
Oh, wait, wait, wait, I see, I see, okay.
it wasn't... it wasn't you, was it?
Lightman decided not to tell me.
everything possible
was being done to find Dupree
and Cal relies on you, Ria.
I don't believe this, I really don't.
Lightman plays God and you make excuses for him.
Ria...
you leave me the hell alone.
I served the bureau for 22 yeas.
didn't want to work for some kind of castrated version of the DOJ, so I left.
Oh, was that why?
or did someone find out about
your illegal operation at the mosque?
there was no illegal operation.
I don't think that's true.
while you people were whining about civil liberties,
extremists were plotting against this country.
maybe you'll quiet down
now that was have bombs blowing up in our backyard.
you know, you don't seem particularly upset about these bombings.
quite the opposite, in fact.
islamic extremist
is flourishing under our noses.
if I'm ambivalent, maybe it's because I see a silver lining.
40 people are dead. Where's the silver lining?
if we allow this administration
to dismantle our security operations,
it's going to be 40, 000.
here's the thing, Dick ...You're a disgruntled ex-agent
waiting for someone to call you back
so you can be a fourth quarter hero.
and I bet
you still have those surveillance tapes.
and I'm pretty sure you wouldn't
have left them laying aroud here.
for your wife or, you know, your maid to trip over.
no, because guys like you
you think that the work you do is so damn important.
I'm even willing to bet
you got yourself one of those Dick Cheney man-sized safes.
let's take a look.
next week's fine.
okay, no, I still don't have a permanent address.
everything's just going to go into storage.
all right. Thank you.
how you doing?
it's so crazy.
I mean, I heard 40 people died already.
and a bunch of them are my age.
Yeah, it is.
but everything's going to be fine.
adults always say that, but I mean, it's not fine.
you know what...
you're right.
but not every day is going to be like this.
you know, my mom's been spending
all this time with dad.
I mean, they think I don't know.
it's like they don't even remember how bad it was.
they'll have to figure it out for themselves.
maybe it will be different.
you don't believe that.
he's so much happier when he's with you.
your mom's here.
you should pack up your stuff.
Hey. I just came to pick up Emily.
what's in the box?
it's the surveillance tapes from the Mosque
the two bombers belong to.
illegally obtained surveillance tapes.
an FBI agent went rogue and bugged the place.
where do we stand? - Well, they're worthless in court,
if that's what you're asking.
I'm not too worried about pros right now.
Yeah, but if you use the tapes,
you legitimize the bugging, right?
law enforcement is always given some latitude if there's an imminent threat.
what about afterwards?
when this gets out, it could lead to more terrorism.
and how would it come out?
these things always do.
intelligence says there could be
five or six more bombings this week.
what if there's something in those tapes
that could help prevent that?
okay, give them to Foster and Loker.
let them start in.
that's what I wanted to hear.
we're through the first 1, 200 hours.
already? How is that possible?
well, normal vocal pitch is less than 500 hertz.
anything higher implies extreme emotion...
anger, anxiety or fear.
that's what the computer's scanning for.
what did we get off the tape from the mosque?
well, the first hit's a marital dispute,
the second is a seven-year-old and the third is a guy
who really needed to find a bathroom.
looks like we have another winner.
it's unacceptable! Completely unacceptable!
people who do things like this must be punished!
stress is up on all the negative words,
and you hear that vocal tremor?
that could be repulsion or disgust.
how the hell are we supposed to match a voice with a name?
foster never forgets a voice.
some of us are better at listening than others.
thank you.
my son...
was not a radical.
it's the same voice.
omar Kahn, the father of the second bomber
it's unacceptable! Completely unacceptable!
people who do things like this must be punished!
where was this recorded?
in our mosque?
Yeah.
someone recorded private conversations in the mosque?!
Absolutely.
so you don't deny that was your voice, then?
I'll take that as a no.
Hey, Loker, do you have the shrapnel plotting
from FBI forensics yet?
Yeah. Check it out.
look how perfect the blast radius is.
that bomb was small, compact.
Yeah, well, it would have to be,
if somebody slipped it into those kids' backpacks.
what are you accusing me of?
someone planted bombs on Jamal Bata and your son.
Yes!
they were murdered!
my boy was murdered!
uh, you know...
I'm thinking maybe it wasn't slipped in.
I'm thinking maybe it was concealed.
maybe someone gave them the bomb disguised as something else.
do you think that I could sacrifice my own son?!
Where's the sacrifice?
I thought virgins awaited him.
rasheed was killed by extremists.
my family and I,
we are the victims.
one of those kids played soccer.
you pack a soccer ball with enough ball bearings...
you got the right idea,
but the concussion diameter was only 200 feet.
the bomb wasn't that big.
they teach you that at Quantico?
a week in Tel Aviv with shin bet.
I am an American citizen.
you can't treat me like this.
do we have info on what the shrapnel was?
Yeah, this says small pieces of aluminum,
glass shards, copper and nickel.
copper and nickel, huh?
just like on the bus?
pretty much.
forensics figured part of that is from the coins in the fare box.
coins...
copper and nickel.
what if the coins are part of the bomb?
the coins were the shrapnel.
I think I know how the bombs were disguised.
omar Kahn hasn't given you one straight answer.
Yeah, well, his son's dead.
he's a little angry.
it looks like a killer's rage to me.
I'm turning him over to the CIA, and they'll do what it takes to get him to talk.
do you know what they call a place that breaks the law every time there's an emergency?
dictatorship.
Where'd you go?
what?
what do you mean what?
this is what you used to plant the bombs in.
I talked to the imam.
and every family that belongs to that mosque, had access to one of these.
you put the explosives in the bottom of the canister.
and the coins acted as the shrapnel.
that thought you had...
that thought right there
horrified you.
you're not behind this, are you?
but you know who is?
Mr. Kahn...
is it someone close to you?
someone you saw with these canisters?
it couldn't be.
no.
who couldn't it be?
what if you're wrong?
what will they do to him?
what would happen?
you accused my son of being a murderer.
you bug our mosques... you...
Mr. Kahn, there are bombs in our streets.
many, many more people will die.
you have to tell us.
don't do it for us.
do it for your son.
do it for all the other children who are going to die in meaningless deaths in other people's wars.
do it for your son.
that recording that you have of me
Yes.
I was scolding him.
I thought he was taking the cans for the coins.
I caught him.
I thought he was trying to steal the money.
I brought him here from Jordan.
how could he do this to my son?
it was your nephew.
FBI.
Freeze!
Freeze!
Messler tells me you fired your gun the same time as the guy moved.
I didn't have a choice.
a second later, he would have hit the detonator.
how'd you know?
just the look on his face, I guess.
you know, we really are going to have to find you an office around here.
Hey, did you hear they found out how we broke the case?
they're saying that the mosque was bugged illegally.
it'll be all over the press tomorrow.
it'll be a recruiting tool for al Qaeda.
that's tomorrow's problem.
how do you think we arrived at today?
go home.
okay.
I mean it, go home.
how you doing? You all right?
I'm okay.
you want to talk about it, love?
Alec and I are separating.
I'm-I'm moving out.
I'm sorry.
you know, I can't even picture it.
being on my own.
it's been a long time.
I got to go to the hospital.
to see torres? - Yeah.
I'll be all right.
you should go. You should go.
how's he doing?
they were able to clear out most of the blood.
everybody's waiting for him to wake up.
that's good, right?
is it over out there yet?
for now, yeah.
I'm sorry I had to lie to you, about...
if you hadn't have picked up on the imam
we wouldn't have found the tapes.
a lot more people would be dead.
I would have had a choice.
what you do-- lying all the time
deciding who gets to know what
it doesn't matter with Loker, 'cause he worships you
or Foster who indulges you,
but not me.
not anymore.
so, time to find a different job then?
what?
it's not the last time I'm going to lie to you, so...
well, the problem's not the job, it's working for you.
you still don't get it, do you?
get what?
this isn't about you.
it's not about me.
you think I wanted to lie to you about your boyfriend?
do you?
you have a talent.
but it comes with sacrifice, believe me.
and it's time for you to realize that that talent, it doesn't belong to just you anymore.
Hi, it's Marla. I changed my mind.
I can't do this right now.
you're here? At the club?
no. I can't meet you. I have to get back to my daughter.
mom?
mom.
mom.
mom! Where are you?
you're reluctant to leave me in charge.
rubbish. - Then why haven't you gone yet?
what? Why are you trying to get rid of me?
you haven't had a vacation in 6 years, Cal. Come on.
you are trying to miss your flight. - I am not.
I am not I am trying to find the Anderson file. - The Anderson file.
I've got it, all right? I can take care of it. Come on.
stop stalling.
where are you going? Honestly, Cal.
the cab is outside waiting for you.
grab your jacket and let's go. You deserve this.
Emily's waiting for you. Come on. - Don't push me. Don't push me.
come on, let's go. Here. Here.
Oh, give me your cell phone.
you don't need to check in while you're gone. It's just gonna stress you out. Come on.
no kicking and screaming?
I have absolute faith in you. And my staff.
here I go, then.
have a good time.
are you really working? We've only been here 2 days.
you really need to learn how to relax, dad.
people who can't relax die younger.
I learned that in health class.
don't worry about me, love, will you?
what are you looking at, anyway? - Nothing.
you're spying on the office?
look, I'm my own boss. That's a 24/7 job.
someday, when I'm a stressed-out workaholic, I'll have you to thank.
when did you become such a know-it-all?
we had an agreement that if I behave maturely, you would treat me like an adult.
so, as an adult, I'm telling you to relax and stop it with the creepy snooping.
if you don't, I'll just go pick up boys by the pool.
all right, deal. - Here you go, sir.
Oh, I'll have one of those, too, thanks.
make it a virgin.
Dr. Cal lightman?
my name's Lou Nemeroff. I'm with the American embassy.
there's an urgent matter that we need your help with.
an American woman, Marla Seeger, disappeared 2 days ago from the oceano hotel.
it's just down the beach.
she was last seen at the hotel bar.
this is local news footage.
this is the bartender who last saw her.
he says that she was drunk, coming on to several men, and that she eventually left with one of them.
the local police, they aren't doing anything.
they believe that she left voluntarily.
she's a really good mom. I just want to find her.
mom, if you're watching this, please come back.
and that's her 12-year-old daughter.
Oh, my god, that's so sad.
what's the state department doing about this?
their official policy is to leave it in the hands of local authorities.
Oh, so nothing. They're doing nothing.
which makes me wonder why you're here.
your boss doesn't know about this little field trip of yours, does he?
I can't ignore what's going on in Mexico.
which is what?
more than 200 Americans have gone missing in the last few years, mostly collateral damage from the drug cartels, but unless it's some pretty blond teenager, nobody even wants to talk about it.
all I need to know is if somebody on this video is trying to hide something.
Yeah, the detective in charge of the case and, um, the bartender.
Dr. Lightman, can you help us find Marla Seeger?
dad. - What?
come on.
some people at the hotel, they said that they saw your mom crying.
why was she sad? - I don't know.
everyone's saying she was a bad mother, but she always took good care of me.
Yeah, I'll bet she did.
you think you can find her?
Oh, absolutely. He's definitely gonna find your mom.
I don't know. I don't know, love.
you ever think that grownups are full of crap?
Yeah. Lots of times.
usually it's 'cause we've made a mistake, done something wrong, but we don't want to talk about it, we don't want to admit it.
which makes us hypocrites.
I think you've got a secret.
and you're too scared to talk about it.
mom always picks awful boyfriends, so I signed her up for an online dating service.
this is a guy you found for her?
he said he traveled a lot and I told him we were coming here.
well, what did he say?
he said he'd meet me.
I wasn't aware of this.
J-Rod 25.
my mom was supposed to have dinner with him last night.
what if he did something to my mom?
we rushed over here right away. Did we hear right?
3 patients have been infected by tainted blood?
the first patient died this morning at cottage hospital, and the second is in critical condition at st. Mary'S.
this is Gary Spar, the third patient to receive a blood transfusion during surgery.
it should have been a routine operation, but he never woke up.
I need you to seal off that O. R. And gather and test everything.
so 3 different patients at 3 different hospitals?
it's no longer a coincidence. We shut down the D. C. Central blood nk.
go help Pat rule out any other possible contaminants.
we're in a real quandary. We need to protect people, but if there's no blood available for trauma cases and other emergencies, patients may die anyway.
do you have any idea what's in the blood?
t , worscecase snario, it's a biological or a chemical agent.
the FBI has been alerted in case this is bioterrorism.
know. I'm on my way to the hospital ceo right now.
what can we do to help?
the people who have access to those blood units all aim no involvement or knowledge.
I need to know who we can trust.
should we get Lightman back here?
I can take care of this.
what have you got?
well, the tainted blood units all came from the overnight shift at the blood banks.
there were 2 techs on duty.
we're taking them down to the lightman group right now for questioning.
Dr. Cho, I haven't forgotten about you.
as soon as I have a minute, we'll talk.
that little boy has sickle cell anemia.
if he doesn't have a blood transfusion in the next 24 hours, he could have a stroke.
what about getting the blood from outside areas?
there's a real shortage. We're working on it, but it's gonna take time that we don't have.
Oh, Jack, thank god you're here. Do you know dr. Foster?
Gillian, this is a lovely surprise.
what are you doing here?
the cdc contacted the rader firm to help assist you since dr. Lightman isn't here.
where is Cal?
he's on vacation.
and hell didn't freeze over?
well, now it's a shame he's gone.
I was hoping he and I could bury the hatchet.
is there a problem? - Lightman and I are friendly rivals, so to speak. It won't be a problem.
will it? - No. Not at all.
the 2 techs from the blood bank are here.
so tell me, what's the deal with Lightman and Rader?
what, they don't get along or something?
Cal despises him.
he thinks all he cares about is money and publicity.
well, for once I'm with lightman on this.
something tells me not to trust that guy.
you're the detective in charge of the seeger case, right?
Yes.
I'm emily lightman. This is dr. Cal lightman.
he's a deception expert and he works along with the police in the united states.
in the united states, yeah.
this is mexico. - No, I knew that. I knew it.
um, now, I saw some news footage, and I think that the bartender at marla seeger's hotel is giving false information about her disappearance.
Dr. Lightman, there is no case here. Ok?
we spoke to several resort employees.
they said she seemed unstable, more than likely a drug user.
based on what?
we found several used needles in her hotel room.
she probably found a fellow drug user, left with him.
she will be back when the drugs run out.
OK. I still think you should have another go at the bartender.
and I think that you and your daughter should have a very lovely time here. Ok?
por favor, lleve a este gente afuera.
no, what about the guy that Tyler that said her mom was gonna meet?
you spoke to Tyler? - Yeah.
there are many people here who would not like the fact at you have shown interest in this matter.
do you understand me? So I'm gonna give you one piece of advice.
stay out of this.
mojito, vor. - and a margarita.
well, no, I was until that woman turned up missing. What's her name again?
Marla Seeger. - That's it, yeah.
Hey, you're the guy on the tv, right? You saw her that night?
what do you think happened to her?
she was dancing with many different men.
she was looking for a good time. She left with one of them.
they were sleeping on the beach or getting high.
what did he look like, the guy she left with?
everything is fine.
you're an awful liar, Miguel.
now you're terrified. What is it?
you work for the police? - Miguel.
Vete a la casa, ahora.
I'm so sorry. We are closing this bar while we restock.
is there a problem? - No.
if you're here on vacation, please tell us whatever we can do to make your stay more enjoyable.
if, however, you're here conducting an investigation, you're not welcome here.
Yeah, torres, it's me. I need you down here.
uh, a woman's gone missing. Yeah.
I'll tell you all about it when you get down here.
just bring something pretty to wear, all right? Yeah.
dude, you're gonna find her.
for you, I will move heaven and earth.
Lightman just called. He needs me to fly down to zulia right now.
he's on a case? - Yeah. A woman's missing. I gotta go.
he's on vacation.
OK. Just give me one sec.
so, how is it working for Cal? Been so long, I can't remember.
I work with Cal. I'm an equity partner, you know.
good for you. That means Cal's been working on his control issues.
Jack... - I meant that as a compliment.
seriously, he was my mentor.
I have nothing but respect and admiraon for the man.
obviously, he doesn't feel the same about me.
Cal says he taught you just enough to be dangerous.
he's the better scientist, no doubt.
but I'm not going to apologize for having ambition and a better business sense.
if we're gonna work together, I have some ground rules.
first, I'm the boss around here.
second, don't try using me to get back at Cal.
so long as you...
admit that there's just the tiniest moment happening right now.
will you admit that?
Hey, Romeo and Juliet, you want to get this show on the road?
people could dying right now.
you can leave. Thank you for coming.
agent reynolds, could you escort him out and bring miss bynes to a more private room?
sure. Will you come with me, please?
people hiding something never want to draw attention to themselves.
that was awesome.
the old routine's a little rusty, but she still works.
I meant what I sai about the ground rules.
I meant what I said.
shall we go find out what miss vines is hiding?
nice work.
it was a regular night at the blood bank-- nothing unusual.
your boss was about to fire you for being late too often.
you knew. Was this retaliation?
she's breathing faster. Foster's getting somewhere.
you have no idea how good she is.
Lightman doesn't know.
he has a hard time seeing the true potential of his employees.
what was that?
little flash of anger at the infallible cal lightman?
you run this entire lab. But I'll bet lightman's never showed you an ounce of appreciation.
so, you and lightman...
you had a falling-out, what, over case?
water under the bridge now.
you know, I never knew my own worth until I got out from under lightman's shadow.
someday, you'll do that same.
it's been hard for me. My husband left us. I'm alone with the kids.
voice pitch is higher.
what's that look there? Shame?
I just went through a divorce myself.
I can barely get out of bed.
I can't think straight, I can't do my job right
people are dying.
you feel guilty, but you're gonna feel worse if you keep secrets and another person dies.
on my last shift, I didn't run the full testing protocol on the blood.
so, you have to test on any blood for different diseases.
I left early. My daughter needed me.
there are so many other safeguards. I didn't think.
I just...
I think we have our culprit. - No, we don't.
someone else just died after a transfusion at euclid park.
and this patient banked his own blood.
central blood bank isn't responsible.
so, you're setting me up on a blind date with a potential murderer?
Yeah. Why? He's not your type?
I'll keep an eye on you. You'll be fine.
what are the police doing? - Nothing.
so, we're doing this on our own. - Yeah.
you know, you pulled me off a really big case back home.
the cdc brought in the rader firm to work with us
not sure. Not sure. Get in.
want to see the sights? - Yeah.
who you with? You, uh, with the hotel?
police? Drug cartel?
who's that guy?
he's with the police or drug cartel.
how did you nd me here?
I bribed a waitress at the hotel.
you picked the wrong part of town to visit.
so, you think I should call the cops, then?
Oh, are you scared of being seen with me by the police, are you?
Turistas estupidos. - Eso fue un "si.
dinos la verdad sobre marla seeger, y nos iremos.
the police told us to say the American lady was looking for a good time, - that it was her own fault. - Why?
zulia depends on tourists.
something bad happens, you all disappear, the town dies.
after the lady from miami disappeared, we were told not to talk to anyone about
what lady from Miami?
do you want me to call the cops, or...
she came here 4 months ago. She was found dead.
the police kept it out of the news.
we should get out of here. I'm gonna tell the cabby that we're ready to go.
OK.
Hey, did you, uh, did you really see Marla Seeger at the bar?
I saw her with one man.
I'm not sure if she left with him or not.
was it this guy?
that's him. I'm positive.
now go. - Cab's gone.
what? - The cab--it's gone.
uh, here, hold that.
um, I'll give $200 to the person that gives us a ride back to our hotel.
now, where's your car?
Quiso decir quinientos-- dos ahora, tres despues de que llegamos.
we're lucky they didn't kill us and dump our bodies in a ditch.
that wasn't luck.
the driver was happy to make some honest money for a change.
you read that? - Yeah. Speaking of big and flashy...
I need you to find out what Rader's up to.
you want me to spy for you?
no, I don't want you to spy for me.
I just want you to poke about a bit. I'll do my own spying.
all right. Well, it's just my opinion, but I think that might be a little overkill.
your opinion? I don't need your opinion. I didn't ask for it.
just do it. All right?
wait here.
that's my daughter!
Hey, she started-- - that's my daughter.
she started talking to me. - You're having a conversation with my teenage daughter!
she started talking to me.
what? - All right. Ok. I'm leaving.
dad, that was the guy that Tyler's been emailing.
I know it was. And you shouldn't have been talking to him, emily. Bloody hell.
you never said I shouldn't talk to him.
well, what am I supposed to do?
tell you not to do every potentially life-threatening thing?
no. I figured if I kept him talking
this is the last thing I need, Emily.
you know, I've got a con man back in my offic and I've got you behaving like Nancy bloody Drew!
I was just-- I was just trying to help.
where are you going?
don't.
I'm Lola.
Jerry Conway. Please.
you're a very confident woman, Lola.
I mean that in the most flattering way.
well. Then color me flattered.
so, how long you been a masseuse?
uh, just a couple of years. - Really?
no, seriously. The last guy I dated was a complete nut job.
Oh, I've been there. - Really? Ok. Well...
you tell me about your last psycho, I'll tell you about mine.
least interesting story does a body shot.
you're on.
I met this weird chick, Marla, a couple nights ago.
Yes. The hospitals trade blood with each other, but euclid park's not at fault.
I've been here 10 years. Yager's been here 9.
we've never had a problem.
we're not the source of the tainted blood.
how can you be sure?
I mean, I can't imagine how. There's been no change in procedure.
there's been no change in procedure.
OK. All right.
Dr. Foster, here's the blue file that you needed.
sorry for the delay.
the blue file? - Yeah.
thank you.
do you know what this is, mr. Dunst?
this is a file all about you-- background check, interviews with coworkers, family, friends.
my team compiled it.
you know, we can scour this to discover what you're hiding, but why don't you save us the time?
tomkins, the new driver in the lab, is a felon.
he told Yager he left the conviction off his job application.
and I should have reported it, but...
maybe you should talk to him.
all right. He's married, goes online to meet women while he's on business trips.
he's a schmuck, but he had nothing to do with marla's disappearance.
are you sure? - Positive.
they met. She left after like a minute.
uh, he says that she was crying and talking to some couple in the lobby.
he seems truthful.
I can't believe you told him I like role-playing and dirty limericks, you
don't knock it till you've tried it.
hang on.
you following me?
you have a lovely friend... and daughter.
is that a threat? 'Cause you really shouldn't be confusing on that.
not at all, dr. Lightman.
you sent someone to follow me, and they threatened my daughter.
I didn't hire him. Some people here do.
ye, well, so do the drug cartels.
I warned you not to get involved.
all right. 4 months ago, another woman went missing, just like Marla Seeger, but this one turned up dead.
OK, listen. I insist that you stop interfering. Ok?
all right, the night Marla Seeger disappeared, she met a man named Jerry Conway.
then she met a couple outside the bar. Did you know that?
there is no case here.
now, if you'll excuse me, I have a young woman who killed her own mother. Ok?
su madre la estaba abusando. No tenia otra opcion.
usted lo habia hecho lo mismo.
por favor, quieto. Quieto.
OK?
I think you should talk to this boy.
he's using his anger to hide something.
she's protecting him, so just talk to the boy. All right?
Llevala a la segunda sala, por favor. Y tu, te sientas, por favor.
Sientate.
how many of your people are involved in this cover-up?
there is no cover-up. - Yeah, there is.
you may not be a part of it, but you know one exists, don't you?
OK. Ok.
the couple that met Marla Seeger say that she seemed unstable.
you talked to them? - Yes.
well, who are they?
Dan and stacy felder. But it's a dead end.
you know, there is a case here.
actually, there's 2. But you already knew that, didn't you?
why did you fail to mention your criminal history on your application?
I was 19 when I stole that car.
if I say I'm a felon, who's gonna hire me?
they should have done a background check.
you've been in health care for a while. Do you enjoy it?
it's very rewarding.
I missed my calling. I should have been a paramedic.
I mean, the action, the glory-- I mean, this...
that's real life-and-death stuff. - It's not too late.
Yeah. I'm too old.
I don't know how we get to where we're going.
are we even aware of our choices?
what, are they just chatting?
we're just getting a baseline right now.
you know, let me ask you something.
was your "aha" moment when youtole that car?
I don't understand the question.
you stole that car and got into an accident with a 23-year-old kid.
the police found you cradling his mangled body.
I mean, did you get into health care because you realized you could be around blood and guts and death all the time?
that you wouldn't have to cause an accident to get sexually stimulated?
sicko alert.
pupils dilated. He's aroused.
from talking about blood and guts? - Yeah. They've sussed that out.
what did you put in the blood at euclid park hospital? - Nothing.
you want people to suffer and die at your hand.
I swear I had nothing to do with the tainted blood.
I never did anything at euclid park.
speech pattern's back to baseline.
he's probably telling the truth.
so, we're back to square one, again.
why are you being so hard on yourself?
people are dying, and I can't stop thinking about that little boy with sickle cell, - and I have nothing for the cdc. - Gillian
you know, if Cal were here, he would have solved this by now.
I should have just made him come back.
we can do this. Ok?
excuse me. You can't come in here. - Jack.
McKenzie! How did you get in here?
I'm a reporter who talked her way into attica once, remember?
scheduled surgeries are being canceled all over D. C. with no explanation.
something's going on at the cdc.
and when a little bird told me you were partnering with the lightman group, my reporter antenna went off.
mckenzie, darling, you have uncanny timing.
let me fill you in. - Can we do it on camera?
Oh, yeah. Thank you very much. I'll tell him. All right. Thanks.
so, a woman named Ramona Posner came here alone from Miami about 4 months ago.
10 days after she disappeared, she was found dead in an alley downtown.
state department and local police ruled it an accident.
well, a cynic might call it a pattern. - Yeah.
Oh, by the way, Rader seems to be making quite an impression at the office.
is he, now?
according to Loker, Foster seems a bit gaga over him.
lovely. - Oh, my god.
what? - Is that jealousy?
no.
where are you going?
I left my hat out by the pool.
don't worry, I won't do anything childish.
why don't you take your extraordinary powers of observation down to the pool and use them to keep an eye on emily?
you're jealous.
Marla came up to us in the lobby.
she said, "I hope you experience the great joy I have," and then she left.
it was bizarre.
you work with the police, right?
I mean, didn't they tell you this already?
Yeah, but I wanted to hear this from you two.
Mrs. Felder, do you have any idea why she would approach you like that?
no. - Not true.
we're gonna be late for the airport.
no, I'll hold that. - No, I'll get it. I'll get it.
you know, you're never gonna get that through customs.
why not? - Because I'm gonna call them.
I'm gonna tell them you got a suspicious package.
that's the kind of pain in the ass I can be if I don't get the truth.
look, it was just a hunch.
there's a fertility treatment center here that matches egg donors with couples.
we're from canada and it's illegal to purchase eggs there.
the donors stay anonymous, but they can choose who they want to donate to.
these are our frozen embryos.
so you thought that Marla Seeger was your egg donor.
Yeah, for a moment. But then we realized that it couldn't be her.
she was nothing like the person the broker described to us.
did you find my mom?
no, love. Not yet.
well, that's lovely.
welcome to the age when they need you but think they're smarter than you.
well, she always was.
all right, I've got one for you.
Marla Seeger was a waitress in a diner, right?
and, uh... Ramona Posner was a teacher's aide.
how do two women like that afford fabulous trips to Zulia?
how? - Well...
Marla Seeger... came here as an egg donor.
she was giving herself hormone injections.
right. And the needles that the cops found.
hence the mood swings.
Hi, can I help you? - Cal Lightman?
Yeah, he's here.
just the man I wanted to see.
you need to call in some of those embassy resources.
can't. Someone from the police department called my boss. I've been reassigned.
and threatened.
our egg donors have high I. Q. S, are from stable backgrounds.
they don't have drug, alcohol, or mental health problems, and many of them are star athletes.
how specific can we be in how the donors look?
I have a couple here, they're seeking someone at least 5'9," blond, blue-eyed, athletic, and an ivy league school.
we found a match yesterday. It's only 50, 000.
in the states, it would be double that.
we're in here.
how do you harvest the eggs, then?
our reproductive endocrinologist, dr. Alvarez, he's responsible for everything.
right. How much do you pay the donors?
the fee is generous. Plus they get a free trip to zulia.
but no one does it for the money.
they just want to help the right couples have a child.
that's wonderful. That's wonderful. - Yeah, it's great.
we actually are looking for a donor with blue eyes and light-brown hair.
and 5'6."
I think I can arrange that.
thought you were gonna say that.
Oh, dr. Alvarez, these are the garrs.
pleased to meet you.
may I have a minute with you, please?
can it wait?
Oh, no, no. We've gotta shove off anyway.
Yeah, we gotta go. - We've got to think about it.
Yes. I mean, it's a big decision. - Yeah.
I've got a question for you, dr. Alvarez.
um, we've been told that my wife's infertility is due to an estrogen imbalance caused by the coriolis effect. Is that possible?
that could very well be true.
did you see Wynn when I described Marla?
flared nostrils, quick breath? - Yeah, he's in this.
there's no way all those donors fit the criteria he described.
Oh, wait. See, they don't have to.
they find donors like Marla Seeger who are desperate for money.
they insist the donors remain anonymous.
wynn can give the buyers any description he wants.
it's a con. - Yeah, absolutely 's a con.
isn't the coriolis effect something about the earth's rotation?
Yeah, exactly. - Alvarez agreed with your theory.
Yeah. That's because alvarez is not a doctor. He's a fake.
I'm in charge of blood orders here, and Yager coordinates trades.
for the other hospitals in D. C.
so why did I have to reinterview these two guys?
because we've got nothing else.
well... he's exhibiting extreme control.
I guess he could still be hiding something.
no, voice pitch is steady. Dunst isn't lying.
but why does Yager keep looking behind him?
and why is he anxious?
What'd I miss?
what happened to the reporter?
I took care of her.
that could mean so many things.
so the story won't be on the news?
that's what you wanted, isn't it?
what, did Cal brainwash you into thinking I'm some kind of media whore without scruples?
come on, guys, tell me you got something, 'cause the tox screen's all negative so far.
and the cdc is getting all kind of calls from reporters.
I can charm one reporter, I can't control the entire fourth estate.
uh, we had the 5-car pile-up on the beltway...
wait. Something's different.
Oh, I had to change the battery, so we took a little break.
but they're both more relaxed now, and Yager's not looking behind him.
go back to before the break.
he was looking at that.
they got rid of it.
why didn't they want us to see it?
Dr. Foster. What can we do for you?
we need to take a look around.
how often do you give blood?
every 6 weeks or so. I have a rare blood type.
what are you looking for? - Found it.
that's sensitive equipment. - What's it for?
processing patient fluid samples.
could you be any more vague?
it's positive for narcotics.
so you've been running a drug lab down here.
Where's Marla Seeger?
I don't know who that is. - Not true.
you're the couple from the office today, no?
your partner Wynn sold you out, made a deal with the police.
he said the scam was your idea.
he never said that.
Dr. Alvarez is responsible for everything.
that's a lie.
no, I can assure you it's perfectly true. What happened to her?
she was one of our egg donors.
she wasn't doing well on the hormone treatments.
she wanted to get the procedure over with.
but then she called to change her mind.
wynn brought her in anyway. Is is all his doing.
what happened to marla?
I started the egg extraction, but there were complications and I punctured something.
she started to bleed.
so where is she?
wynn has an apartment. She may be dying.
one more day, we would have lost her. - Yeah.
listen, how did you know that I wasn't part of the coverup?
when I accused you, you showed genuine anger, not guilt.
listen, about that man you sent to threaten my daughter.
that wasn't me, that was my boss.
you sure this man was part of the cartels?
if I was you, I'd keep him away from the evidence locker.
I'll keep an eye on my boss, too.
rader and Foster busted a drug lab.
he's saying she's brilliant and has--all right, keep it to yourself, huh?
uh, Lou from the embassy asked me to stick around--Lou from the embassy? That's Lou from the embassy. That's nice.
Yeah, he asked me to stick around for a couple extra days.
so I said yeah. Is that all right?
and here I was thinking we were happily married.
the two techs were making designer fentanyl in the hospital lab.
they were using the blood as a means of transport.
Yeah. Liquid fentanyl was injected into the blood bags, which would then be delivered to all the heroin processing cenrs in the city.
a lab within a lab. Pretty ingenious.
problem was, the new guy tomkins picked up the wrong bags one day.
and the fentanyl never triggered any alarms in the patient tox screen because it's a common anesthetic used for surgery.
sorry I'm late.
they filled you in?
well, I guess we'll reopen the central blood bank d tr anack down all the units that left euclid park hospital.
thanks to you.
by the way, you should both know that I taped an interview with Mckenzie Dodd about the case.
should be airing in about an hour.
how could you do that?
the cdc hasn't had the press conference.
Oh, I forgot. You love the spotlight.
I promised an exlcusive to buy us time.
this was all about getting back at cal and the lightman group, wasn't it?
Gillian... you know me too well.
it was fun. - Bye, jack.
here's my card.
in case you plan on making a life change.
Thanks, man.
well, it's been a very tense time, but the threat has been eliminated.
Dr. Cho credits you with helping a little boy with sickle cell anemia.
I knew he was slick, but, man...
you were the first person that the cdc turned to for help.
could I just say that I owe a debt of gratitude to dr. Gillian Foster, who really cracked this case.
this potential health disaster wouldn't have been averted without her.
mommy!
so you're saying that you can just treat me like a child whenever you want to.
no, I' m not. I'm saying that on occasion, it's my right as a parent to be suspicious and overprotective.
OK. Then on occasion, I reserve the right to throw tantrums and spend all your money.
deal.
now, if you're done forcing me to work, can I have my holiday back, please?
how do you learn to live longer?
well, there's meditation and yoga, but for you, I'd definitely say do both.
yoga's that thing you do in a lounge chair with a mai-tai in your hand, right?
Yeah. Yeah, it is.
don't hate me too much because I'm filled with admiration.
give it to me.
so who sent the flowers, then?
cause you know I'm the jealous type.
welcome home, Cal. Rumor has it you never even left town, but that can't be true because you look like a different man.
I feel like a different man.
you know, a vacation's a wonderful thing.
6 days of nothing.
well, I heard you were working on a case.
well, it barely qualifies as a case.
I feel so relaxed that I don't even care that Rader was here.
then Torres told you. - Well...
so, uh, he sent you the flowers, then? - Yep.
have you checked them for aphids?
no, no, I don't care. But did he see any of my research?
I kept him out of your library.
and is everyone still here?
he didn't poach anyone.
and did he break into the office supply closet?
he definitely didn't do that. Except one thing
the sprinkler system was acting up a little bit.
that's odd.
what exactly happened between you and Rader?
Oh, I'd tell you, but you'd think I was lying.
Loker. My card.
just in case you're thinking of making a life change.
well, he's lying.
this son of a bitch has been playing us the whole time.
no, no. Wait.
you really think we're that dumb, huh?
no, I didn't say, I didn't say, I didn't say
No! No!
and, you know, we should consider changing our company investments portfolio.
you started dating again, haven't you? - Stop it, Cal, right now!
all right, stock broker?
money manager? Banker?
Oh, I thought you wanted to have some fun.
Oh, I'm having fun, don't you worry.
Oh, really?
Yes, Torres?
there's a visitor in your office, Sally Robinson from London.
what?
Sally who?
Robinson. High school sweetheart or something?
in my office?
gotcha!
God almighty.
Yeah, but my mates still call me Terry.
come here.
Sally Robinson, eh?
hold on, is that a canoe in your pocket, eh, Cal?
nicely played there, Mia.
well, thank you anyway.
excuse his manners.
Terry Marsh, his ex-partner in crime.
in a manner of speaking.
Gillian Foster, current partner in crime. Nice to meet you, Terry.
you, too. - All right, that's enough of that.
good-bye, Dr. Foster.
wow, Cal. That is so charming.
well, it's been 22 years, isn't it?
listen, Jill, you fancy meeting us for a drink later?
that's Gillian, actually.
and she's busy.
call me if you need me.
Yes.
so what are we drinking to?
how about Sally Robinson, wherever she may be.
you wanker.
you all right there, Terry?
Oh, don't start that bullocks with me, Cal.
what?
with the eyes, like you're reading my fortune.
no, I'm just pleased to see you. Really.
though a touch curious as to why now.
well, truth be told, I've thought twice about looking you up loads of times.
Terry Marsh thinking twice.
well, that's a first, isn't it?
come on.
come on where?
I'll tell you what, Cal, I'll do a deal with you.
what's past is past.
what's done is done.
it's just all water under the bridge.
fair?
water under the bridge, then.
Oh, hello, lovely lady.
I'm Terry.
you should say hello to my dad.
Hi, dad.
I'm Cara. This is Alice.
stage names?
Oh, down, dad, down.
forgive him.
ready?
whoa, feast your eyes.
Hey, Cal, no.
not that way.
over there, son.
I don't play cards anymore, Terry.
look at me very carefully, Cal.
I did not get this jailbird for nothing.
don't make me say it.
I owe you my life. There you go. I said it.
do this for me tonight, and then we're all square.
how much do you owe?
12 large.
12 grand? - It'll be like the old days.
you know, I'll do all the talking, and you do-- - yeah, science.
well, it's Texas hold 'em, no limit.
and this is my last 2 grand in the world.
OK.
I think I've had a bit too much to drink for this, Terry.
Yeah, well, that's rubbish. But nice try.
Hey, Terry.
you're feeling luckier tonight?
Hey, gents.
an old mate of mine, Harry Sloane from N. Y.C.
how you doin'?
Hey, Foster. Have you seen Lightman?
he's taking a personal day.
Yeah, he's with a man who's on the scotland yard watch list, which means, when he's over here, he's on the FBI watch list.
it's part of the special relationship with the brits.
nothing recently.
watch lists are more precautionary than anything else.
yet, your tone is telling me it's more than just a head's up.
then it should also be telling you that I'm not at liberty to discuss this any further.
GBH, grievous bodily harm, 22 years ago?
they want you to dig into Lightman's past with Terry?
let's just say it's his immediate future I'm more worried about.
thousand.
I fold.
call.
down.
you ok, Terry?
I'm good for it, Lance. You know I am.
I know you are.
we're all gentleman here, someone get this man a drink.
Thanks.
call.
all-in.
I said-- - I heard you the first time.
call.
ten high.
you called me on a jack high. That's ridiculous.
apparently not.
gentlemen, it's been a pleasure.
listen, can we have a little break, please?
just a minute, huh?
why not?
order up some eggs.
Cheers.
do you mind?
Harry Sloane from New York city?
are you out of your bloody mind?
I could hardly say you're Dr. Lightman, the lie expert and the reader of faces, now can I?
I assume the 12 grand was just a teaser to get me in the game, is that it?
how much do you owe this psychopath?
how much? - 95
95 grand?
you expect me to take that kind of money off these men instead of just walking out of here while I still can? Excuse me.
Hey, no, no, no.
Cal, you know exactly what's going to happen to me if you walk away.
so is this a prank or a serious death threat?
man: Very soon now, you'll all be sorry.
it's all going to end this week.
the pain will stop.
uniforms. Private school?
uh, college preparatory.
you're the only one this video was sent to, Mr. Anders?
as far as I know.
it was left on my desk during the lunch hour in an envelope marked "headmaster, urgent."
has anyone else seen the tape?
just the FBI, and now you.
have you closed the school?
school's out for the rest of today.
my first piece of advice to you--close the school.
for how long?
until we determine who made this.
so indefinitely.
Dr. Foster, do you realize what that would do to us?
that would ruin our school.
so this is about money?
from handwriting analysis on the envelopes, student files, locker searches and security camera tapes, agents on site were able to make a preliminary list of students who might fit the profile.
25 names?
fit the profile for what?
homicidal intent.
Oh, god.
first of all, hands up, who's heard of the lightman group?
all right, well, we are scientists who interpret human emotions.
and this morning, with your help, I'm going to run an experiment which should be quite informative.
so rather than listen to me drone on all day, let's just get started, shall we?
man: Very soon now, you'll all be sorry.
it's all going to end this week.
the pain will stop.
no one's that good.
you two are working together. Who is he, Terry?
you cheating me? 'Cause I will put a bullet in your head.
there's 105 grand there.
you and Terry are even now.
you keep the change. We're all gentlemen here.
at least for now, with all those witnesses in the next room.
I said he keeps the change.
mate, say something.
you're welcome.
don't mention it.
I love you, Cal.
don't forget that.
Yeah, I'll see you in another 22 years.
rough night, huh?
Yep.
no rest for the wicked.
something tells me you already know that.
you want to know what else I know?
you know your buddy, Terry Moss, he spent 3 years in Bellmarsh prison in England.
87 to '90 for assault and battery.
Yeah, it was a long time ago.
and he's gone now, and I'm tired, and I'm hungover, and it's none of your business.
you made it my business when you spent the night at the Penthouse suite at the park hotel where there were prostitutes and illegal gambling.
those women were prostitutes?
how'd you know?
did you follow us?
that's interesting.
there. Surprise and shame in less than a second, and then nothing.
pulling down the mask. Put her on the list.
Oh, go back a few seconds.
there you go. All right, see this girl?
same girl, she glances at the teacher. There you go, see?
and he catches her at it.
he's got his eye on her for some reason. - So does this girl here.
look.
and then she looks over at that guy.
nice one, Loker.
soon you'll be asking me for a raise, which I've been assured that we can't afford, so stand down.
right, well, keep watching the tape, then.
I'll be back in a minute.
you look awful.
and yet, I feel so much worse.
I said 22 years, not 22 minutes.
we're in a lot of trouble, Cal.
they know who you are and what you do, and they ain't happy.
what do they want?
Oh, you know, they want to see you saw a girl in half.
what do you think they want?
they want you to be their magic man.
and they're waiting for you around the corner in a van.
and if you don't come now, then...
then I'm done.
as in dead, done.
Yeah, I'll see what I can find out from him.
your buddy's lost his FBI tail.
now do you have any clue on where he could be right now?
come with me, will you?
he's in my office.
he's in your office?
what the hell is he doing in there?
I've got a major bloody problem here.
Oh, you're damn right, you do.
you do understand that Terry's involved with an extremely dangerous crinal, right?
lance Mcclellan. - Lance Mcclellan. Exactly.
he's a new-school crime boss. Educated, well-connected, hidden in plain sight.
this ends now.
look, Terry's family to me. There's no way I'm going to let him hang himself.
Yeah, well, I'm not going to let him hang you, either.
wait, wait, wait. What's Mcclellan's game?
it depends. - Which means you don't know, right?
that means that you're gonna help me help Terry to help you.
if anyone's helping anyone here, it's gonna you helping to bring down Mcclellan and Terry.
and I know he's your friend, but those guys are bad sons of bitches.
look, Mcclellan sent Terry for me, which means he needs something from me, right?
whatever it is, he needs it quick.
if you're suggesting what I think you're suggesting, you can forget it, ok?
you're not a trained undercover agent.
knock it off, Ben, you know I'm doing this. - Not if I arrest you, you're not.
you're going to arrest me?
I won over a hundred grand in cards last night.
I know a bluff when I see one. You're not arresting me.
and you keep Foster out of this, all right?
her focus needs to be 100% on that school.
and I'm banking on you to have my back for this.
Oh, you mean like a real FBI agent? - Something like that, yeah.
so we're needed in the conference room. Torres is in there with three kids from the school.
all right.
what's wrong?
nothing. Nothing.
look, Reynolds was just telling me what a bad seed Terry was.
you know, and it came as a bit of a shock, you know.
cause there was I thinking that he was a choir boy.
all right.
stand up. Stand up, stand up.
all right, when did you make the video? - What?
what's your name again? - I didn't make it.
exploding buildings, that was news footage, right?
your name is...
I don't know. Probably. I couldn't...
I'm the one who made that video.
Jared? - Jared Rollins is my name.
I made the video.
get your hands out of your pockets.
so what's the plan, eh?
is it a bombing or a shooting or what?
cause you know, there always is a plan, right?
you tell me.
so when did you make the video, Jared?
what does it matter?
well, I thought it would have mattered a great deal to you.
I made their video, that's all you need to know.
well, who did you send it to?
what?
and stop right there.
he's lying, he didn't make it.
Jared, why would you lie about making that video?
cause maybe they all deserve to die, or at least worry about it.
who?
they know who they are.
if he didn't make the video, he sure wishes he had.
his face, body language.
it's homicidal intent, right?
your name - Stacey.
Stacey. That was news footage?
I don't know. Probab.
I'm the one who made the video.
Jared Rollins is my name.
OK, when he said he made the video, he deliberately interrupted Stacey.
and she's relieved.
he's covering for her, he's protecting her.
Oh, nice shirt.
help yourself.
I thought you'd fallen in.
right now, that would be a quality problem. How's your hand?
Ah, it's all right.
you know, I don't normally approve of torture, but in your case, that is personal.
what's going on, Terry?
what's going on?
- You all right? You're all right.
you remember the, uh, the property flips we used to do back in London?
I only broke in and sold the wrong man's Miami mansion.
but it turns out, he was connected.
answer the question. All right?
what are you dragging me into? - Nothing!
I don't know.
I swear to god, Cal, I do not know.
well, come on, then.
thank you.
Oh, shut up.
so the video...
even though you didn't make it, does speak to your needs?
and which is partly why you took false credit.
and you say they deserve to die, but you're clearly scared to name them.
Loker, take Jared back to the conference room.
I need to talk to Stacey now.
we're done.
Where's Lightman?
he's not in his office. We keep calling him, but it's going straight to voicemail.
where could he be? I mean, that's not like him.
could you keep trying?
Dr. Lightman.
good of you to come.
I warn you, I'm not cheap.
well, Terry's life cover - I barely.
we have a deal, then.
I like to think of all of my people as family, but one of these three has been informing on me to the government.
now, you're going to tell me for certain which one is the rat.
what, so you can kill the man?
three minutes, Dr. Lightman.
right, then.
all right, boys?
well, you're right.
there is a liar in the room.
liar's you.
what are you doing?
now's not the time to play the comedian, all right?
get up.
just give him one more chance.
he won't let you down, will you?
none of these men is an informer.
but you already knew that, didn't you?
good.
told you he was the best, didn't I?
Yeah, what I want to know is when you told him that, Terry.
was it last night?
last week, last month?
quiet, ladies.
nice one, Terry.
Stacey, are you and Jasmine friends?
the exact same look she showed for Jasmine in class. Contempt.
she's mean to me.
in P. E. In the locker room.
but she's not the only one. I hate P. E.
well, did you tell your teacher?
he knows.
Stacey, I wish I didn't have to ask you this... but do you ever wish Jasmine or any of the other kids who are mean to you, harm?
harm?
like... you think I made that video, that it was...
I may have thought about revenge, but I don't want them to die.
she's telling the truth. She doesn't want to harm anyone.
please don't tell Jasmine I told on her.
Oh, sweetie.
maybe she is the one who made the video.
all this is is her fantasy of revenge.
who's the P. E.Teacher? - Why?
it's not you, is it?
Yeah, but I would never turn a blind eye to bullying if I saw it.
did you know that these kids were picking on Stacey?
well, I could see she wasn't the most popular.
is Jasmine popular? - Yeah. I'd say so.
very, actually.
it's always the popular ones who think they can get away with murder.
spoken like a true scientist. - Trust me, I just know.
we should get Jasmin in there now.
so you two go back a ways?
well, I'm sure Terry's told you all about it.
property scams.
you picked out the easy marks.
Terry took them for everything they had.
Yeah. If that's how Terry remembers it.
I remember you with the business of picking out just the right mark.
the absolute bloody business, I swear.
Terry tells me that you owe him your life, Dr. Lightman.
tell me about that.
I--I thought it was water under the bridge.
even so, while we're waiting.
what if I was to say we were West Ham supporters at Millwall game?
he saved you from soccer hooligans.
manner of speaking.
or were you two the hooligans?
not guilty, your honor.
you see that look, Terry?
that look says that your time on this planet is running out.
Yeah, put a cork in it, Cal, all right? That's enough.
see, it's always the same, the criminal mind.
never sees the end of the road. Forever hoping, often actually believing that there will be just one more corner to turn.
not his fault. He's not the only one. I'm basically wired the same way.
all right.
they're on their way. Five minutes out.
who? - The man that you're going to meet with.
see if he's on the level or not before I do business with him.
call him back. Cancel it.
excuse me? - What?
look out the window.
right, there's an FBI tail out there. They've been on Terry like a cheap suit since he landed.
don't play games, professor.
you can thank me later.
show me.
see it? - The blue one?
no, no. Not the blue one, the other one.
that one over from it, the red one. The red station wagon.
might as well have had the blue light flashing on top.
call him back. Change the meet to the warehouse.
get up.
a whole lot of people think that it's just the victims of bullies who get hurt.
but the bullies pay a price, too.
you know, maybe not physically, but-- we were just joking around at first.
Yeah, about what? Stacey's weight?
that, and... I can't explain.
it got out of control.
I'm so sorry.
are you, though?
it wasn't just me.
there are others.
if that video means what I think it means, that it's all coming to an end-- the pain, her pain, mine?
I wish it would.
I hate myself for what I did to Stacey.
but I couldn't stop. He didn't want us to.
he meaning you. - Hmm?
and you still mean to tell me you had no idea this was going on?
I can't be everywhere all the time.
ducks the question while grabbing for an excuse.
Yeah, classic deflection. - If Stacey made that video, it's because of me.
Where's Stacey?
she went to the bathroom. - How long ago?
a few minutes. - More like 10, I think.
Stacey, come on. Open up now, please.
I can't find a pulse.
Oh, my god. Oh, my god, I missed it. It wasn't homicidal intent. I misread the sadness.
it was suicidal intent. Oh, my god.
Yeah, I need an ambulanc all right, let's go. Let's stay three cars behind.
the parents have been contacted, right?
it's been taken care of.
tell me she's going to be ok.
she's going to be ok.
stay here.
talk amongst yourselves.
was that really an FBI tail? - Yep.
and you just ditched them? - Yes. To earn his trust, yeah.
Oh, well, that worked like a charm, Cal.
we got blindfolds and locked doors.
are we even yet, Terry?
are we ever going to be even in your eyes?
Oh, you think that's what this is about? It's about who's even with who.
that's a bit rich coming from you, mate.
OK, mate, I did three years in prison saving your ass.
so what do I gotta do? I gotta die to save yours, have I?
you should have come to me in the first place. You should have been honest with me.
you should have said,"Cal, I'm in a bit of bother. Could use some help from a friend I know I can count on."
and you would have done what? - I don't know, I would have done something!
anything's better than this!
I haven't heard from you in over 20 years, mate.
over 20 years.
what was that?
let's just face it, eh? You wanted the past dead and me along with it.
apology accepted, by the way.
where the hell is Lightman?
my financial advisor, Harry Sloane.
how do you do?
I see you two already know each other.
well, any friend of Terry's is a friend of mine.
so, pleasantries out of the way.
let's get down to the heart of the matter, shall we?
the merchandise, Mr. Jones?
you say it is the best ever, flawless, in fact.
I gave you my word, man to man.
see, now, that's why I'm here.
yes or no questions, they only go so far.
so how flawless is the merchandise?
currency is perfect.
there's a flicker of doubt there, but that just be about the deal in general.
I mean, perfect counterfeit currency.
that's an oxymoron if ever I heard one, huh?
what is this sideshow?
he's telling the truth, though, when he says that the counterfeit's perfect.
he truly, he does believe that.
but then again, he's just, um, he's what his name down at the U. N. all over again, right?
uh, excuse me?
that guy, he truly did believe all that wmd nonsense.
so, cleverly, they sent him off down to the U. N. to sell it.
the rest is history.
no one sent me here.
the currency... is flawless.
Nah, I... I mean, I'm sorry.
but it's not good enough.
who is this ass? Huh?
screw him, let's go.
but we're not done yet.
no, you swore to me that you would-- Hey, hey!
is he telling the truth, Dr. Lightman?
yes or no? - Yes! He believes that he is, yes.
good. So do we have a deal or not, huh?
is this the best you've got, Dr. Lightman? Because so far, I'm under whelmed.
or is there more?
right, well you put me in front of the actual counterfeit with the bank notes in his hands, and I'll know just how good his product is.
just you.
tey can stay here.
no. Terry's with me.
it's not negotiable.
no, I'll be all right, Cal. - Don't be dumb.
you need to be thinking about yourself right now.
Yeah, now you tell me.
it's not negotiable.
come on!
say nothing, Terry, not a word.
this is him? That's your counterfeiter, right?
the best there is.
50, 000 euros, right there.
bloody hell!
how many containers you got?
that is not your concern.
put it back.
all right, um... what's your name?
he doesn't need to know that. - I gotta establish a baseline here.
easy answers to easy questions.
then I can get to bigger questions.
Otto... What's your real last name?
Frankel. - Yeah.
how many kids u got? - None.
how long have you been married? - I'm not married.
where are you from? - Chicago.
Hey, get on with it, please, will you?
um, these notes are counterfeit, right? - Yes.
how good are they?
we already tested a modest amount without detection.
well, Dr. Lightman. - What?
well, he hasn't answered my question yet.
easy, fellas.
it's taken care of.
he was right.
FBI.
I don't think I can do this.
I'll be right here the whole time.
don't worry.
just take your time, Stacey.
you knew what they were doing to me, Mr. Fitzgerald.
you didn't just ignore it.
you started it all. - Oh, Stacey...
you kept telling me I was fat and lazy in front of them.
that's not true.
your hands and eyes say otherwise.
so do I.
I'm so sorry, Stacey.
you know, I had a coach like you once who had it in for one of the kids on the team.
constant verbal abuse disguised as authority.
Eddie, Eddie Johnston. And nothing that Eddie ever did was ever good enough.
you're out of line. - And the example that that coach set for the rest of us, just like you did for Jasmine and all of her buddies, we thought it gave us the license to make Eddie an outcast.
I never touched a hair on her head.
right. Because we did it for you.
I wanted you to have to live the rest of your life knowing that what you did to me made me...
you knew what this was really about all the time.
I know, because I sent you a video, too.
which you neglected to mention, Mr. Fitzgerald.
making you guilty of obstruction of justice.
and if this keeps you away from kids forever, I'll take it.
right, Stacey?
Yeah. - Wait a minute.
one kid has a psychological breakdown, an illness, and I'm to blame?
we need to talk-- I don't think so.
thank you.
there's a whitening of the skin around the eyes, which is a dead give away for the kind of fear that we try to hide when we lie.
and a slight rotation of the right arm, which is what we call in the trade a shrug fragment, which means he's got zero confidence in what he just said.
the eyes of a cheat who thinks he has all the cards, but who knows I'm telling the truth.
well, he's lying.
the son of a bitch has been playing us the whole time.
whoa, easy! No, I didn't say-- you really think we're that dumb, huh?
easy! I didn't say! I didn't--!
No! No! - FBI! Nobody move!
anybody else?
down on your knees! Now!
how do you do that?
blanks. - Blanks?
no, no, I mean, with your eyes. How do you do that?
Oh, it's just practice.
what's going on?
put your hands behind your back.
I swear, I'm getting too old for this, Terry.
I really am.
FBI have been onto you and Mcclellan for, oh, a while now.
special agent Hutton. - Oh, nice to meet you.
you, too.
superior work, agent Reynolds. - Well, likewise, my friend.
so how's that for having your back?
that's just like a real FBI agent.
thanks a lot, Cal. - What?
so, uh, when'd you first realize I was undercover, Dr. Lightman?
back at the poker table, you were angry and fearful, but on my behalf.
ha, really? - Yeah.
come on, let's go.
Ben? Hold on a second.
I'll tell you what.
Terry walks for his part in this.
what? - And then we're evens.
no, I couldn't have done this without him.
he goes from here to the airport. And he doesn't come back.
suits me. - Ever.
you know, you are one lucky son of a bitch.
can I borrow him for a minute? Just personal stuff.
Yeah, just, just make it-- quick.
I knew you were up to something the moment you walked into my office.
and then I had to sit there and I had to watch you play me like one of those yuppies back in London.
mcclellan had me by the short and curlies! - My best mate!
Oh, come on! What, do you think I wanted to do it?
you were in this from the start, Terry!
they knew who I was before I even sat down at that poker table.
what was that? That was just some little test run.
so what do you call this, eh?
Oh, a couple of broken fingers for a slice of that pie?
do me a favor.
and you can stop treating me like a bloody moron now!
Yeah, well, maybe I just came to resent you, Cal.
hate me, more like. Years will do that, Terry.
you saw all the way through it, didn't you?
you saw right through it from the start.
still helped me, though, didn't you? You know why?
because you always have been and you always will be my best mate.
don't count on it. All right?
I'll tell you what.
my debt is now paid, in full!
no, wait a second, wait a second. You owe me now.
Yeah, I saved your bacon and I covered your ass with the FBI!
I'm a very lucky man.
Yeah.
well, all luck is earned, in the end.
well go, then. Off you go.
don't you dare look back.
have a seat.
Why? - This is an intervention.
what?
all right, so I had, you know, a few drinks with a mate.
well, more than a few, actually. - This isn't about drinking.
well, then if it's about poker, I won a hundred grand.
hundred grand?
uh, 105, actually.
it's not about gambling, either.
well, what is it about, then? - It's because you don΄t trusting us.
you were in trouble, and you never came to us.
wait a minute-- no, you wait.
we're a team.
and you risked your life without letting us help you.
Hey, I wouldn't be here at all if it wasn't for Terry Marsh.
fine. So where does that leave us?
that leaves you all fired.
you gotta be kidding! I didn't even want to do this intervention.
well, just you, then.
just you are fired, for having no spine. - I don't believe this.
good. 'Cause I'm lying.
what, you didn't spot that?
Oh, did your emotions get in the way?
you should really work on that.
well, this has been terrific.
really fantastic. Quite the intervention.
we should do this again soon, very soon.
the intervention was my idea.
my mom died when I was young, and my dad was long gone by then.
Terry and his family, they took me in even though there was no room and even less money.
and one day, Terry and I got into a little bit of trouble with the police.
not your concern, but they were on their way.
and no way we could get out of it without one of us acting as decoy for the other.
so Terry took the fall for you? - Yeah, he did.
he said, "you're supposed to use that brain of yours for something, "not be dragged down into the muck by stupid bastards like me.
he was right. - Yeah, he was.
Yeah. It cost him three years of his life.
so anyone who wants to compete for my loyalty with Terry Marsh, not really in a fair fight.
good night, love.
the following story is fictional and does not depict any actual person or event
it's black Friday, the post-Thanksgiving kick-off into the holiday shopping season.
and retailers are advertising even deeper discounts this year, trying to lure cash-strapped consumers.
all managers to their departments.
all managers to their departments.
all right, who wants to save some money?
doors opening in 5 minutes.
where is it?
maybe your wallet's in the car?
I swear, it was in my jacket.
save our place.
sorry man.
excuse me.
pardon me.
all right, when I say "digital," you say "corner."
digital!
corner!
digital! Corner!
for an extra 100, how can we not go with the 50 inch?
how about an "excuse me," bitch?
open the doors! Open the doors, dammit!
did calculus get harder since we took it?
that's what I said.
that's all right, I'll just figure it out myself.
I mean, you'd think with the intellectual stock I come from, though.
apples always fall further from the tree than you think.
there's something to be grateful for, right?
how was Thanksgiving?
Oh, you know, dad lectured...
I did not lecture.
mom fretted. I didn't lecture.
so much to be thankful for.
I mean, don't you think I'm getting a little old for make-believe family holidays?
well, that's how your mom likes it, love.
Heh. You're a little odd.
Why?
the apron.
I think it's becoming.
Hey, uh, dad, Gill, this is Max Roland.
apparently he's 16 and a big fan of your book.
over here. Now!
he's a complete stranger.
my address isn't listed. How'd you find me?
online.
I just need half an hour of your time, Dr. Lightman.
you got 2 minutes.
my parents have lied to me my whole life about who I am.
I'm not their kid.
who are you, then?
this kid. James Knox.
the James Knox?
well, how do you know you're him?
look at the scar.
James Knox has one just like it.
we've all got scars. You want to see mine?
look.
I took a DNA sample from my parents.
all right, I'm not a match.
their story of how I was born, it doesn't make sense.
I can't spend another Christmas with people who might have stolen me.
please.
I have $500.
this is all I have to pay you.
will you talk to my parents?
I have to know the truth.
want a sandwich?
if he really is James Knox, he's in a very difficult spot, psychologically.
we need to handle this carefully.
well, don't we always?
I can't believe you took his money.
well, he wanted me to take him seriously.
I am.
who holds interviews on a holiday weekend?
be patient. Max really wants this.
Hey. Hey.
ready to interview my parents? They're getting antsy.
I'm not gonna interview your parents, you are.
I thought you said you were gonna help me.
no, look. If you want to know the truth, you ask the questions, all right?
so no "yes or no" phrasing.
and look at me. Look at me.
don't back down.
Max, you don't have to do this.
it said in your book, the best interrogations are when you can watch, you don't have to ask the questions.
I want the best.
all right, well, that's what you paid for.
Hey, uh, it'll just be a few more minutes.
they're in with some of the other nominees.
you look nervous.
what's wrong?
look, I know I'm not your son. Who am I?
Oh! This again?
Max, not here.
there's no pictures of me as a newborn.
it doesn't make any sense.
you were born in Ecuador.
mom had you premature. We've told you all this.
you went to Ecuador pregnant?
I'm sorry, but that doesn't sound like something a smart mom would do.
I think I know better than you what a mother would and wouldn't do.
he said "mom," she said "mother."
distancing language. Yeah.
I ordered a DNA test online.
I took hairs from your brushes.
I just got the results back.
I'm not related to either of you.
nice fear on both of them.
Max, what the hell is going on?
what is this?
Mr. and Mrs. Roland, I'm Gillian Foster.
I'm a psychologist with the Lightman Group.
what is this place?
Max came to us. He needs our help.
Max, we're leaving.
Mr. Lightman, they're lying, right?
they're lying.
Max, now.
go.
you may have just sent him home with his abductors.
Where's Reynolds?
still in South Carolina.
well, that's one problem solved.
the other one's the cops. We can't call them.
if the cops or press or FBI get wind that someone who may be James Knox surfaced,
I mean, the vultures will pick Max to pieces.
we have to protect him.
and we have to talk to the Knoxes.
what?
finally got you thinking like a criminal.
wonders will never cease.
if this thing goes south, you're putting up my bail.
michigan 2005.
shoppers burst through the doors of a major retail chain causing multiple injuries.
india 2008.
rumors of a landslide at a Hindu temple cause panic.
about 140 people lose their lives trying to escape.
Los Angeles.
lakers fans celebrate a championship by looting and rioting.
about a million dollars worth of property damage to local businesses.
in every example, the violence was instigated by someone in the crowd.
what are you proposing, Mr. Loker?
2 of your customers died.
dozens were injured.
people are looking for a scapegoat, and Digital Corner's an easy target.
what if I could prove your company wasn't at fault?
cases like this turn on comparative negligence.
if the stampede was crowd induced,
it would reduce the settlement considerably.
this is the raw feed from Channel 3.
notice the dad showing his boys how to lock arms and form a phalanx.
they... what, they expected violence?
well, convergence theory says that if crowds act aggressively, it's because people bring an aggressive mindset to it.
and in the close-ups, you can see their faces.
they're identical to those of athletes during competition.
this crowd was a powder keg and somebody in it was the spark.
maybe so, but we can't have our name dragged through the press during our busy shopping season.
we're planning on settling first thing Monday morning.
how much are you expecting to pay out?
20 million, give or take.
give me a few days to prove my thesis before you settle.
if I can trace the stampede to somebody in the crowd, the Lightman Group gets 10% of what you save.
you save us 10 million, you earn one.
and if you pay the full 20, we don't see a dime.
Hey, how'd it go with the suits?
well, we got the job. Where were you?
none of your bloody business.
I figured you were up to it, so.
it's probably a gross overestimation on my part.
I appreciate the confidence boost.
well, selling's the easy part.
it's delivering, that's the trick.
and that's what you promised.
so you and Torres are on your own.
think you're up for it?
I've read every major study on group behavior cover to cover.
this is my wheelhouse.
fascinating.
well, time will tell.
any more words or inspiration?
Yeah. We need the money. And don't embarrass me.
you think you found James? After all these years?
Mr. and Mrs. Knox, we don't want you to get your hopes up,
but we would like to do a DNA test just to confirm things one way or another.
the scar's from the same type of operation, though, right?
do you have a picture?
Oh, sorry.
it was taken this morning actually.
he's got your chin.
this must be overwhelming.
no, it's just I'm... I'm shocked that we might be able to find James.
I got a question for you.
do you... either of you, do you remember, was it overcast the day that your son was abducted?
do you remember?
it's 16 years ago.
I think it was overcast.
it definitely was.
it was?
I think you're lying, Mrs. Knox.
when people are telling the truth, they don't feel the need to recall small details many years later.
you're ashamed of something.
what are you ashamed of?
what are you talking about?
what is it? What is it?
is your son still alive?
what happened to James, Mrs. Knox?
or did you murder him? Did you murder him?
of course not. Did you murder him?
did you kill him?
what the hell is wrong with you people? She didn't kill him.
did you kill him? No.
did you kill your son?
did you torture him before you killed him?
did you make him suffer? No, it was an accident!
what?
I...
went into the kitchen while the bath was running.
I don't know how...
he had drowned.
I was going right back.
Robbie, Robbie, I didn't mean to.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I didn't want you to hate me.
maybe they're lying.
they're telling the truth to the police right now.
if I'm not James Knox...
who am I?
you're the same person you were yesterday and the day before, Max.
don't call me that, all right.
I'm someone else.
well, what do you want to be called, then?
who do you want to be? You want to be, uh, Johnny?
you want to be a Paul? Do you want to be a Steve?
you want to be a Sid? You know, you look like a Steve to me.
all of these are boys around your age that were abducted when they were babies or when they were kids.
which one do you think is you?
I'm never gonna find out who I am.
right, that's what you're trying to say?
no, you know, you're a crap listener, boysie.
really, pay attention, right.
what I'm saying is I'm in.
are you?
think carefully before you answer that because if we do go down this rabbit hole, there's no telling what's gonna bite you.
I'm in.
he's in.
Max, you have to let this go.
he's not gonna.
I mean, why should he?
if he's not your son, he should know why you've kept it from him.
I mean, either you've got a good reason or you're monsters who stole someone else's baby.
that's ridiculous. Is it?
want to see if the cops agree with you?
I know you both love Max deeply and you would never want to hurt him.
but you are. He's in a lot of pain.
you're not protecting him anymore.
you're just hurting him.
her name was Cheyenne.
she was barely older than you are.
it can cost a fortune to adopt.
and back then, we didn't have the money to pay for a service.
she didn't want any formal papers.
she just wanted out.
and we wanted a baby.
we gave her some money for the hospital bills and that was it.
you were her baby, but you're our son.
Maxie, what? We've been good parents to you, haven't we?
say what's on your mind, son.
why didn't you tell me?
we thought if anyone learned the truth...
they'd take him away from you.
Yeah.
who is she?
my mother.
is this all of them?
these are the lead plaintiffs.
there's another 80 names on the suit, but these are the real bloodsuckers.
or the real victims.
why are they even talking to us?
well, Digital Corner sold it to their lawyer as part of the investigation.
well, let's be honest, who doesn't enjoy a good bitch session?
did you know that the doors opened 20 minutes late?
they didn't even have my TV in stock.
it was a bait and switch.
I was almost trampled to death.
listen, we need to get paid.
OK, it's our job to determine what started everything.
that's what we've been asking.
the store hasn't turned over any security video.
let's just begin with what you remember.
one of the rent-a-cops picked a fight.
it was right behind me.
I saw him pushing folks around like cattle.
he was a bully. Damn near knocked me over.
all right, so this guard starts a brawl, and then everyone pushes for the door?
can you describe him?
white guy, shaved head.
you all just shifted your gaze to this guy.
you're looking to him for the answer.
you think we're lying?
well, not consciously.
it's more likely a case of memory conformity.
you've all heard each other's story, so you think it happened to you.
right. But you didn't remember the race of the guard
because you never saw him.
so you go to the real source.
I'll be supervising these interviews.
Waylon said he was shopping for his family.
eye shift downward says otherwise.
educated guess, he was there for someone else, like his mistress.
Oh, and he is not your only client with a truthfulness allergy.
Delisha faked anger when Rita asked her about her arm.
her eyebrows never pulled together, lips never pressed or tightened.
she's faking it.
that doesn't excuse the store or the security guard.
Oh, the bully? No, that wasn't a lie.
as far as we can tell.
just because a few people are gaming the system doesn't mean Digital Corner's off the hook.
what are you doing in the DMV database?
your dad is committing a felony.
why am I not surprised?
I'd take you with me, but that would make you an accessory after the fact.
feel free.
I, uh, can't believe you found me.
he's been looking for me?
Oh, yeah, for a long time now.
Yeah, he just wants to meet you.
he's here?
Yep.
there's nothing to be ashamed of.
you did the right thing by him.
OK.
I want to meet him.
Maxie boy.
you're up.
Max, this is Cheyenne Matson.
Oh, my God.
I knew I'd see you again someday.
I just knew it.
I found you.
I can't believe it.
Oh. Oh, my baby.
Max. What?
stop hugging her, son.
Why?
cause she's lying.
she's not your mother.
you don't know what you're talking about.
I gave birth to him in Virginia.
and then I... See, that's a lie.
what are you gonna do, you just gonna keep them coming, or are you done now?
have you been drinking today?
no, I don't think it's alcohol.
I think it's drugs.
so what was your drug of choice back in the day.
was it "X"?
meth? Coke?
there it is, cocaine.
what did you do? Did you sell him for drugs?
how did you get him?
OK, ok.
I was on the pipe back then.
I got close with my dealer.
he had this crash pad in D. C.
and I got there and there was this baby.
who's baby?
I don't know. I don't know.
he was crashing.
and he said he was gonna smother him, so I took the baby.
you kidnapped him?
you were trying to protect him?
I saw this ad.
these people wanted a baby, so I said I was his mother.
what was the name of your drug dealer back in the day?
I only remember him as Romeo.
it was a long time ago.
of course Max says he's fine.
he's a 16-year-old boy.
Yeah, but that doesn't mean you have to coddle him, does it?
I mean, a hard truth in the long run is far better for you than a soft lie.
we are talking about a child.
and what child are we talking about?
foster here disapproves of my parenting techniques, which I think is a bit of a cheek, don't you?
Oh, so you're not actually talking about, let's say, I don't know, an adolescent boy?
no.
should we be? You?
no. No.
then maybe you two can explain something to me.
well, I'll do my level best.
all right. Well, try to picture this.
I'm in Hilton Head, eighth hole, 2 under par, best game of my life.
then all of a sudden I get this call from my FBI supervisor wondering if my interest in 16-year-old boys is business or purely recreational.
and which is it?
well, see, that's what I'm hoping that you can help me with.
because it seems like somebody here in D. C.
used my personal id number and password to access an FBI database.
but when I'm not actually in D. C.
that sets off alarms, so can either of you tell me who I should blame for ruining my vacation?
Loker?
Hey.
sorry, I just... I heard what happened.
is there anything I can do?
you could stop looking at me like you think I'm a freak or screw-up.
I don't think you're screwed up,
I think your family is.
there's a big difference.
perfect girl with the perfect life's some expert on messed up families now?
my dad's a human lie detector.
I have a family history of suicide.
and my divorced parents sleep together sporadically, fight constantly, and still insist we get together on holidays.
how's that for perfect?
at least you know who your parents are.
Yeah.
well, anything I can do to help.
I promise, one freak to another.
you know, I go away for one weekend, and you two start acting like Bonnie and Clyde.
you're doing Christmas with me.
no one needed to convince me that bringing the authorities into this case was a bad idea.
Yeah, well, if you had come talked to me first,
I could have helped avoid all of this.
any chance that can happen now?
because of what these people did, a kidnapper got away with abducting a baby.
Mr. and Mrs. Roland.
are you here about Max? Have you seen him?
no, what happened?
he left a note. He ran away.
we have a warrant for your arrests.
being charged with false adoption and child endangerment.
come on, let's go.
so, bottom line, they're saying we provoked it, but they don't have anything concrete.
just firsthand accounts.
well, the news footage didn't show anything.
your security guards, they mention anything about bullying your customers?
look. People resent authority.
I get it. My dad was a cop.
Mr. Bernardo, uh...
one of the things we do is look at body language.
and we've found that sometimes when people are feeling vulnerable, they tend to cover their...
gonads.
can you pull up that photo you showed me last month?
Ria... You want me to do it?
Churchill at Yalta...
roosevelt and Stalin are divvying up the world.
britain's being left out. The hat placement says it all.
now...
what is it you're not telling us?
we have some security video of the parking lot and the storefront.
what does it show?
things got a little heated between the guard and some of the customers.
but that was 10 minutes before the stampede.
well, that's embarrassing, but it's not a direct cause.
you're trying to bury the evidence? No.
we don't want the nightmare of someone posting it online.
but since you signed a non-disclosure agreement,
I'm happy to share it.
Cheyenne's description matches a former drug dealer on record who went by the name "Romeo" like she said.
but the guy dropped off the grid a few years ago.
all right.
what did Reynolds say about Max?
there's still no sign of him.
if he's on the run, first person I'd want to talk to is Emily.
bad boy fixated in finding the truth...
she probably feels like she's known him her whole life.
Hey. They haven't found Max yet.
no? Well, uh, where are the cops looking for him?
I don't know.
you got any ideas on that?
Oh, sure. He's at the secret hideout where all the teenage runaways go.
he's just some messed-up kid who got screwed over.
uh, you should take that.
Really? Yeah.
Thanks.
yeah?
they found Max's biological parents. They're bringing them in.
Oh, th... that's great. I mean, that's great, right?
Max is gone, though, and the state he was in when he ran,
I mean, he could be about to do something that could ruin his entire future.
I need you.
she knows where Max is.
Hey.
thanks for that.
Oh, for lying to Emily? Yeah, so I wouldn't have to.
all right. Romeo's real name is Ray Blake...
narcotics distribution, assault, spent 8 years in prison.
is there any family who might know where to find him?
well, he had a daughter, but she died while Blake was in prison.
they'll be happy to see you no matter what...
there he is.
thank God.
where are my real parents? I didn't find them.
found you, though. Thanks, Em.
now, I would have expected this kind of thing from him, but you lied to me.
Oy. I know.
no, she did what she had to do to help Max.
he was in trouble. Help him?
you get his parents arrested, and then you make me lie to him to get him back here? He'll be safe here.
Yeah, till you send him off to foster care.
the FBI knows we have him. We will figure this out.
now who's he gonna trust?
did you find Blake?
all we've got is his old parole officer. That's it.
foster, come on.
Mr. Donnelly, you were the parole officer for a convict named Ray Blake, right?
in my old life.
ray Blake? Yeah, he was a drug peddler.
used to go by the name of Romeo.
no logical reason why.
do you have any idea where we could find him now?
creep was a gambler.
otb in Bethesda was about the only place I could ever count on finding him.
you seem a little angry about your past life.
what, you didn't like being a parole officer then?
you know, my old boss sent me to the department shrink.
I don't think I need another one.
how'd you end up in that chair?
that's a little personal. Don't you think?
Yeah, very personal, I'd say.
I got a game to get back to.
Hey!
look. Either you did something really bad back then or something really bad was done to you. Which was it?
that's none of your business. Yeah, it is.
this is important.
fine. 16 years ago, somebody broke into my house, killed my wife, put a bullet in my back, and stole our baby son.
OK, I broke the crowd into sectors.
I followed 6 people at a time from the minute they showed up till the riot started.
you find someone to pin it on?
watch this guy.
he moves through the crowd. This guy grabs him, pulls him back. A second later, the sectors behind him surge forward.
mob mentality takes over.
who do you think was in that stampede?
they weren't peace-loving hippies, but...
working people, Loker...
parents who can afford game systems and mp3 players one day a year.
they're so desperate to make their kids happy, they wake up at 4 a. m. just to stand in line.
Yeah, you're proving my point.
contagion theory says crowds infect the people in them.
OK, you can dress it up with science all you want. It's still an agenda.
you're trying to impress Lightman.
if I bring home 7 figures, he has to respect that.
Loker, I don't know why Lightman screws with you the way he does or why he's got it in for you.
but I wouldn't get my hopes up about things changing.
let's take Lightman out of it.
this video does not lie.
let's go see the guy and see who's right.
why were you cutting the line?
someone said the doors were opening. Guess I got excited.
well, the look on your face isn't excitement.
it's not even aggression.
that's panic.
you were afraid, before the stampede even started.
my daughter...
I told her to stay close. And when I heard her crying...
look, it's every parent's worst nightmare.
then the crowd started moving before I could get to her.
is she ok? She got knocked down.
her arm's broken in 3 places.
I don't know what we're gonna do about her hospital bills.
well, she wasn't hurt in that stampede, like you've claimed.
it happened before that, didn't it?
you think I hurt her? No.
but I do think that you are an opportunist.
look, just tell us the truth. How did she break her arm?
it wasn't in the stampede, was it?
she fell.
when I heard her crying, I panicked.
I went looking for her.
and the crowd thought that you were breaking its first rule...
don't cut the line.
or they saw you moving forward and assumed the doors were opening.
either way, what they couldn't contemplate in that state of mind was a father rushing to help his daughter.
OK, so what happened, those people who died...
it was my fault?
he turned up this week.
are you saying that you might have found my son?
alive?
that was his photo.
but they cleared all my parolees.
well, Blake fooled them, apparently.
when was the last time you saw Blake?
maybe a year or two before that night, maybe more.
I... I'd given him a random drug test that he failed.
well, that's what sent him back to prison.
Blake's daughter died while he was serving that sentence.
I think he blamed you for breaking up his family.
he left you to live with the pain, just like he felt you did to him.
whatever. The...
the only thing that matters now is my son.
so, what, if the DNA matches, he'll come home?
that's not up to us.
well, I've waited 16 years for this.
if that's my son, I want him back.
Hey. I think we can put a bow on this one.
the man in the crowd started the Stampede.
well, shouldn't we find out about Ken's daughter before the Stampede?
is that why we were hired? No.
I think the client's gonna be happy with your findings.
they will be ecstatic. It'll save 'em millions.
and it's a pretty big payday for us.
well, I think you should take some of this windfall and have yourself a little celebration, both of you.
Really? Yeah.
as nauseating as it is for me to say this to you, Loker...
well done.
Hey. I got us the last table at Marcelli's, 8: 00.
we're going big. I'm gonna pass.
Lightman buying dinner is unprecedented.
these families deserve to know why their loved ones died in a parking lot, Loker.
look, we know what happened.
some customers blindly followed when Ken pushed forward.
the others didn't want to be displaced.
either way, Ken was the stimulus.
how did his daughter break her arm?
I've been through the tapes dozens of times, before the stampede and after.
there's no evidence.
then have a nice dinner.
Hey. Taxi!
whoa. I got you.
what's that glare?
where?
right there, that light coming off the asphalt?
Yeah. What is that?
Hey.
you want to meet your father?
Oh, here they are.
Hey.
Max, this is your biological father.
John... meet your son.
Hi.
you have your mother's eyes.
your name is Owen.
is there anything you want to ask your father?
I play music.
I don't know why I said that.
I'd love to hear you play sometime.
do you know anything about music?
I don't. Heh.
you like hockey, right, Mr. Donnelly?
Yes. Yes. Yes.
I have season tickets for the Capitals.
we could go next week.
uh, for your birthday.
well, my birthday is in April.
and I don't play hockey anymore.
I quit.
well, we... we don't have to go.
Yeah, you have the wrong person.
Hey, careful, son.
I'm your father, Owen.
no, this isn't my dad.
he doesn't even know who I am.
he loves you. He has this whole time.
he just couldn't find you.
no, you got the people who really love me arrested.
give him a chance.
all right? He wants you in his life.
I don't want him. Finally, the truth.
Cal... No, he needs to hear it.
that man in there, that's what you have.
so, deal with it.
Max, we care about you.
I'm not your kid. Ok?
you want a kid, go have one of your own.
want to lash out, do you? Well, go ahead.
give me your best shot.
come on. Give me your best shot.
come on, then. Come on!
is that enough?
Attaboy. Attaboy.
that enough? Attaboy.
we're working out the details, but it looks like the settlement will be more in the neighborhood of 2 million, not 20 million.
your findings were worth every penny.
1. 8 million...
that's a lot of zeroes.
OK. Before we take this, uh, we have a couple of outstanding questions.
uh, what are your protocols for dealing with ice?
we salt.
you salted the parking lots and the sidewalks that morning?
I'll show you the inventory if you'd like.
that won't be necessary.
classic evasion.
and you know what? We'll pass on the bogus paper trail.
if Ken's daughter doesn't slip on the ice, he never pushes through the crowd.
couple that with your security guard's negligence and the mindset of the crowd, you've got a perfect storm.
if you're looking to renegotiate, we can do that.
this is what we found.
then I'm glad we have a non-disclosure agreement.
you can use the whole report or none of it.
or I'll see that it leaks.
and then you'll have a tragedy and a cover-up.
we'll use none of it.
he can see me, can't he? Donnelly?
Yeah.
I came peacefully so he could see me.
where did you find him?
he was outside of a liquor store, next to the OTB that Donnelly mentioned.
it'll take a few weeks for the FBI to confirm their DNA test.
Yeah, but if we can get a confession today, you can go home with your father.
your daughter was taken from you when she was...
6, right? And she died in foster care?
you've been waiting for this day, haven't you, Mr. Blake?
you think the best thing you could have done for your daughter was to avenge her death by stealing the son of the man responsible.
he should have let me keep her.
I begged him.
you are going to jail for the rest of your life.
you know that, right?
what do you want me to say?
the question really is, what do you want to say...
to Donnelly before you disappear?
my only regret through this whole thing is that you didn't know who did this to you.
now you do.
so does his son.
what?
the boy found him. His son found him.
they're strangers.
Yeah, well, give them time, eh?
you want to tell me how we went from a 7-figure payday to nothing? It wasn't an ideal outcome...
no, it wasn't. We can barely keep our heads above water.
you decide to go ahead and sabotage a potential elephant account.
I mean, what did you do?
you put in 40 full hours on this?
and then there's Torres' time?
you have any idea where that's coming from?
your pocket. Bloody right, my pocket!
you promised me you'd deliver.
shifting blame from the guilty party...
that wouldn't have been the truth.
you see, that choice...
that choice...
that's how you make your contribution to this firm.
we could go dark, for all I care.
we follow the truth here. Right?
no matter the cost to our egos or our wallets.
so, if I'd have taken the money...
I would have sacked you.
Hey, can I get one of those "attaboy" speeches from yesterday?
I've run out.
you think this co-custody thing can really work?
2 sets of parents is better than none.
this is so screwed up.
just give it a chance. It'll work itself out.
when in doubt, I just do what she says.
go on. Off you go, son.
hell of a rabbit hole.
we made it.
so, have you forgiven us?
I guess. Have you?
well, you were protecting a friend, right?
so, you are your father's daughter.
well, I know a little bit about how crazy families can be.
you think he'll be all right?
don't know.
hope so.
maybe we should invite him to Thanksgiving next year.
he'd fit right in with us.
Yeah.
kabul Afghanistan
Salaam Alaikum.
who are you?
where did you come from?
a friend.
a hungry, thirsy friend.
put down your weapons! U. S. Forces!
don't shoot! Don't shoot! Stay where you are.
don't shoot! Don't shoot! I'm American!
I'm on your side. -American?
I know what you're looking for.
how much? -Relax, dad. It's a write-off.
it's a rip-off, more likely.
it's gorgeous, Emily. -It's for the christmas party.
you know, the one you're throwing for your fantastic staff?
who you've always said are just like family to you.
you two, you're in this together, aren't you?
this is a conspiracy, right?
Oh, dad, I'd like you to meet rick massey.
Oh, yeah?
I'm Gillian.
Hi.
Dr. Lightman?
right.
you're with me. You, too.
not too much on the lights and that, right?
dad.
I'm--I'm sure he likes you. I wouldn't worry about it.
so, deputy assistant
to the president for national security affairs?
what's that mean--CIA?
I work for the president.
I'm going with NSA.
I need you to boot up your satellite link system.
what I'm about to tell you is classified, top secret.
nearly ten hours ago in afghanistan, 30 miles from the pakistan border,
two recon marines were separated from their platoon during a skirmish with the taliban.
they haven't been seen since.
lieutenant williams from wisconsin,
sergeant hart from arizona.
this is hart's third tour of duty.
Williams' wife just gave birth to a baby girl.
key in the code jhk 34zy.
within an hour of their disappearance,
predators, drones and special missions units were deployed in the search for them.
46 minutes ago,
one team found something.
Franko James vincent from Baltimore, so he claims.
34 years old. -Oh, my god.
or is this...
it's another John Walker Lindh?
an American who went over to the Taliban?
don't know what he is yet. All we know for sure is
he's given up a Taliban compound in the Gremen valley,
where he swears they're holding the two marines.
well, I get what you want from me.
transmit. -Ok.
ready.
Mr. Vincent.
you say you know where the Taliban are holding two U. S. Marines?
how do we know you're telling the truth?
I don't want to die.
all right.
the part about not wanting to die-- that's true enough.
when did you join the taliban?
I was an aid worker,
And...Teaching school when the war broke out.
and--and I got very sick in a village
and they-- they saved my life.
just-- They took me in
that's enough. That's enough. Stop there.
no denial about being taliban. -No.
well, the delay's not helping,
but, I mean, I wouldn't trust him as far as I could throw him.
he's lying, then. Well, look, you'd need
to bring him here for me to get a proper read. I'm sorry.
while we mount a mission to rescue those marines,
we'll have to treat him as an operational asset in country.
no, if you think you're going to send me to afghanistan...
you do think you're going to send me to afghanistan, don't you?
and there was I, dreaming of a white christmas.
how quick can you get me there? -Cal.
have a helicopter on the roof that'll get you to andrews in 20, wheels up in 30.
all right. And, um, Gill?
not a word of this to emily, all right?
Hey, hey.
Hey. What's that?
it's secret santa. You pick a name
and you get that person a gift. There's a $20 limit.
it's for the christmas party. -All right.
well, look, um...
I've got to go away for a few days.
Oh. Where?
Oh, just out of town. I won't be long. Well,
the christmas party's in 3 days. You'll be back for that, right?
Oh, I wouldn't miss that for the world.
liar.
no, it's fairy lights and...
Really...Crappy music,
and--and goodwill to all men.
right up my alley.
Where's your boyfriend
Dick? -Rick. Funny, dad.
Oh, did I scare him away, did I?
for your information, he went home to study.
Really?
Mm-hmm.
all right.
in that case...
all right.
here.
get the best... Christmas lights for your tree
that money can buy, all right? -All right.
dad, where are you going? Hey.
Oh, they need me in Florida.
Oh, right. Ok. What happens if I pick myself?
then you put it back and pick again.
and besides, somebody already has you.
Mm-hmm. -Who?
it's a secret. -Duh.
all right, then.
why are you
well, dear...
I love you. -Love you, too.
this is going to be the best christmas party ever.
what?
you can't go to that place again.
I have never been to afghanistan in my life.
you know what I'm talking about, Cal.
two missing marines, love.
fear's healthy.
don't forget it.
right you are.
Bye, darling.
foxtrot 31 delta...
tango one romeo headed for your 20, over.
zero alpha, copy, bring it on, out.
Dr. lightman?
this way, doc.
"doc." I like that. I do, you know? I do.
right this way.
watch your head here.
festive.
Yeah, the more I make, the better they get.
welcome to the north pole, Dr. Lightman.
John parks, team commander.
how do you do?
look, straightaway, I see you're wondering what idiot came up
with the plan to send me over here.
so, we have something in common.
Charlie team at altitude,
waiting for your go-order, boss.
right now, all you and i care about are my 12 soldiers in the air,
ready to halo into the taliban compound our new friend here says
are holding those two marines.
wait. I mean, you already sent the mission over before I even had a chance to talk to you?
I moved my team within striking distance.
I do my job, you do yours.
final decision's mine.
no disrespect, but we don't have a lot of time
to screw around before these animals start cutting heads off.
all right, well, do me a favor, will you?
just hold on the go-order, you know, till i've had a chance
to talk to your new friend here.
Yeah, i'll do my best not to screw around, all right?
we gave him a shave, cleaned him up.
sat-link eyes to your people.
do you believe in santa claus?
up.
Cheers.
say hello to the folks back home.
I'm serious.
say hello to the folks back home.
hello.
whoa. he felt that.
deep sadness at the mention of home.
what are they? paper snowflakes?
when Lightman asked him if he believed in santa claus, I saw a flash of hope.
Where's home for you, Franko?
what?
Where's home for you, Franko?
1276 Bayview, Baltimore, Maryland.
blurts out a street address, like he memorized it by heart.
I--I lived with my aunt.
aunt wendy.
I'm sorry?
Wendy Perriman, my aunt.
is that supposed to mean something to me or
my aunt.
Bayview what?
Bayview avenue?
Bayview...terrace? boulevard?
street? what is it? -avenue.
because you seemed, you know, pretty sure about every other detail,
except for that one small thing.
Bayview road, Baltimore.
and the natives pronounce it "Ballmer."
you know, I'm not buying much, if any,
of the whole aid worker,
aunt Wendy story.
I mean, why lie about your aunt Wendy
unless she's part of some cover-up,
Some--what is it?
CIA?
Oh, that struck a nerve.
all right. moving on.
how do you know where the taliban are holding these two marines?
why give up that information?
because I'm an American, not like you.
Ex-cia,
rogue lunatic-- I mean, whatever it is, any idiot can see
that you've--you've grown some deep...
hatred of all things uncle Sam.
you know what I think? I think you're just...
a traitor...
trying to save his own skin.
what's your taliban name, Franko?
this close to the border with Pakistan,
the taliban never moves more than ten miles with prisoners in the first 48 hours,
and only at night.
the place I told these soldiers about is the safest place to hide.
that close to where the marines were captured.
he said the first half of that with extreme confidence
because it's probably true.
but he used the word "safest,"
inferring that the taliban have more than one place they hide out.
where else might the taliban be hiding?
nowhere.
Oh, well, your shoulder begs to differ.
all call signs, stand by for go.
he's lying.
Yeah, he's sending you to the wrong location.
He's...lying.
Charlie one, over target area now.
you're sure he's lying? -yeah.
no. well, 70%.
Yeah, at best, he's sending you to an empty compound;
at worst, it's an ambush, right? -sit down.
70%? -it's not an exact science.
if it was, you'd have Bin Laden by now, wouldn't you, huh?
abort.
do it, mo. Now.
abort. Say again, abort the mission.
you better be right, Dr. Lightman.
Yeah.
forget it. No way in hell.
look, i get that you're a scientist,
but this is no place for experiments.
look, this guy, he's definitely hiding something.
whatever it is, it's buried it deep.
and there's a connection to your government somewhere.
I'm telling you, you gotta let me
dig it out of him.
you mean to tell me this maggot's some sort of spy for us?
Yeah. CIA, or related.
and either he's protecting
some long-term deep cover operation,
or he's just been out here too long
and he's flipped to the other side.
those are just theories, doc.
look, you already proved smarter than that When you axed plan "a."
don't give up on me now, pal,
or I'm on the first donkey out of here, all right?
whatever he is, whoever he is,
I don't care.
I need accurate intel from him,
and I need it yesterday.
Yeah, yeah. No, you're right.
SOD the science. Give me a weapon.
well, at least I'll get home in time
for my daughter's christmas party.
I'm serious. Weapon please.
Mr. Komisky?
please, Ed.
state department? pentagon?
defense.
special deputy operations and plans.
I'll be observing Dr. Lightman's progress with the prisoner.
top secret news sure does spread fast in this town.
ha ha! -welcome.
cute. -this way.
all right.
well, he's ready for battle,
and he's smart enough to know when to live to fight another day.
so he's a warrior. He's not a martyr.
these are 3 of the boys you tried to lead to the wrong taliban compound.
what was it? eh?
was it an ambush?
was it an empty compound?
Oh, empty compound.
well, that's something, I suppose. eh, lads?
Hey!
we keep hearing this story
about you being a cia agent who got boned.
that you got sent out here years ago,
left for dead. is that right?
if i don't get home to texas, boy,
my wife is gonna take my daughter
and move back to michigan.
look, this is my last tour.
after this, I'm done.
is it true you got boned by the CIA?
still don't understand what you did.
What'd I do?
you went over to the enemy, you punk.
attempt at anger.
no, wait, wait.
now, I get it. I see your shame.
I see it.
all right, it was either join them or die.
I mean, these 3, they might not do what you did,
but I might.
I mean, I'm a natural born coward, me.
my blood runs as yellow as the next man's.
Lightman just called him a coward.
how is this helping get our marines back exactly?
well, Lightman just called him a coward
because he's about to present him
with an opportunity for redemption.
watch.
but what you've got in common with these guys is that it's all about living to fight tomorrow,
right, in the hope that someday soon
you get to go home.
if that's not on the cards,
then all that remains is the last fight you fight.
and then the question becomes...
which side of the fight are you on?
he's thinking about it.
Oh, god. I'm--crap. I'm so sorry.
uh, here, let's-- quick, before it stains.
there is another hideout in the area.
but first, I have...
first you have what?
a condition.
it's a very common power play
for someone who feels backed into a corner
with nothing to lose or gain.
you have a what? What do you got?
every time you ask me a question,
I get to ask you a question.
the truth buys you the truth.
you lie, I lie.
all right.
but first, you show me on the map
where the taliban are holding these two marines.
all right?
OK, here. There's two caves
with a tunnel that connects them.
it's been there for over 200 years.
why didn't you tell us about this place to start with?
no. he's been with the taliban too long.
you're still the bloody enemy.
me, on the other hand
I'm all that's between you two.
I'm really sorry about this.
I needed an excuse to talk to you, away from komisky.
we need to figure out some signals
or this is gonna get expensive.
Komisky's no stranger to Franko.
Yeah. you saw that, too?
another thing I saw
he's careful to keep himself off the sat-link cameras,
hidden from Lightman and Franko.
have you heard from my dad in the last 24 hours?
Yeah. Yeah. why?
well, he always calls to check in when he's out of town,
and he hasn't this time.
his phone goes straight to voicemail.
sweetheart, he's really swamped right now,
and he'll call as soon as he can.
hey guys, we're minutes away from...
Hi, em, how's the party coming?
well, what are they minutes away from?
minutes away from what?
he will be back before you know it, ok?
I gotta go, em, all right? -we'll talk later.
Yeah, yeah. that's it.
that's the cave.
bloody better be.
tell me.
am I ever gonna get home?
we don't have time for this game.
it's not a game. it's a test of trust.
right?
well, if you ever do get home,
you're pretty much screwed.
it's the right cave. I'm 100% certain.
Charlie one, target confirmed. Move, move.
Charlie one, copy, out.
stand by...
contact! Contact!
man down! Man down!
you and your science just let this bastard lead us into an ambush.
Hey! No! Back off!
all right. Hey.
what did he just say to you? What did he say to you?
he said, "kill me now, it would be an honor."
you meant it, didn't you?
who are you now? Huh? Who are you?
my Taliban name is Khaled. -Yeah?
my name is Mo--short for Mohammed.
zero, charlie one, charlie three's hit bad.
wait. Out.
did you or did you not send my men into an ambush?
I did not!
I told you it was a taliban hideout.
did you expect it to be guarded?
maybe you underestimate your enemy.
no, wait! Jo, wait!
Hey, he's telling the truth.
no, he was as shocked as you are by what happened.
and you're not going to kill an unarmed man in cold blood just out of sheer frustration, so knock it off.
all right?
you know that man?
you know that man?
I've never seen him before.
do you know that man?
I've never seen him before.
Foster? Foster, who you got in there?
ed Lomisky, defense department.
Hi, Ed. I see you've met my friend Franko,
Oh, a little bit ago.
is he one of the ones who sent you here?
hey?
is he the one that sent you here?
what did he tell you? what did he tell you?
did he tell you you were gonna be a hero?
did he tell you you were gonna be a patriot?
is that... what then, eh? then what?
Oh, that's between you and him?
well, I'll be very happy to set up that face-to-face meeting,
but right now, we've got some mess to clear up,
all right? Move. Move.
kill the feed.
kill the feed!
what, he's shutting us out?
get him on the sat-phone.
order him to give us eyes back.
Yeah, if you think Cal Oightman is gonna jump
just because you bark, you don't know the man.
trust me.
call me if he comes back online.
you know Franko, don't you?
the only reason I'm here is because I want to see those two marines
returned home alive.
us, too.
look at you, huh? look at you.
a minute ago, you said you were willing to die. At this man's hand, it would be an honor.
now look at you.
you'd anything you can to get home
just because of what you saw on that sat-link.
zero, charlie one, over.
casualty, charlie three.
chest wound.
if he calls in an air strike, right,
in a matter of minutes, a lot of people are gonna die.
doesn't matter what side you're on.
when I got here,
you thought I was here to help you, didn't you?
didn't you?
there's another way in.
where?
when did you get hooked, Dr. Lightman?
let's go! Let's go! Hurry the hell up.
what? What?
on war. On this.
you get high on being in the middle of it all.
don't you?
don't you? I can see it in your face.
why are you-- why are you doing this?
OK, you know what?
there is no other way in. They're dead.
look, I told you, you lie, Ilie.
all right, Bosnia, 1994.
I didn't see direct action,
but I was this close to it.
you get lucky just one time. You survive, right?
it's delusions of immortality.
right? right?
you're enjoying this.
no, no. no, no. Now, now it's your turn.
you owe me the other tunnel to that cave.
tell them to go left
no. You tell 'em. You tell 'em.
you tell him! You tell him!
tell them to go left about a hundred yards.
there's a rock with an arch in it.
this doesn't work, he's done.
Yeah, well, so am I.
this isn't just a test of trust, is it?
right.
you're playing this game
because you think that if this mission goes south,
then you're not the only one to blame.
but if it succeeds,
I'm gonna become your brother in arms, right?
I'm gonna be more likely to help you somewhere down the road, right?
don't hold your breath.
ms. lenox, what do you know about Ed Komisky?
Mr. Iomisky is a hangover from previous administrations.
man's more like a pentagon ghost.
we're beginning to think that he was involved
in some sort of operation
which abandoned this man Franko in Afghanistan.
are you aware of any such operations?
no.
you don't want to think about it?
I know of no operations involving Franko.
no records exist of CIA
or any other agency's involvement.
but he could be an agency asset
that you have never heard about?
no. I understand what you're asking.
but I'm not sure I can get any answers quicker than you can.
Franko's aunt.
I need her here as soon as possible.
can you do that?
Hey, Oightman's back on line.
he needs our eyes and ears for this next part.
we never had never had this conversation. I got it.
if I help get these marines out,
I want my story told.
that's above my pay grade, pal. Dream on.
it's right at my pay grade,
if your story's true.
well, that's the back entrance into the cave.
they're gonna hit a tunnel.
and they can go one of two directions.
left? left is bad.
Charlie one, move right, over.
no, no, no! Wait, wait, wait!
wait a second!
if this is a back way into the cave,
it's also a back way out.
we mount a frontal assault.
that way they'll try and haul ass out the back way
with the prisoners.
that's what i'd do.
how about you, eh?
hold, positions, charlie one,
hold positions. set evac charges.
stand by for enemy, over.
that's not Florida.
Emily... how did you get in here?
you lied to me.
he lied to me.
Charlie one, hold positions.
set evac charge.
stand by for enemy. Over.
dad?
dad?
dad!
did he just get...
no, no, no, he didn't.
Charlie one, move to alternate cave entrance.
Charlie three, charlie three, zero alpha, over!
how'd the taliban find us?
they got his radio when he was hit.
they used it for directions to find us here.
fire support, confirm position.
moving through tunnel now.
going firm at tunnel intersection.
contact! Contact!
marine prisoners and taliban!
3 taliban dead.
evac complete.
we have the two marines and rescue team complete.
setting evac charges now. over.
copy that.
alpha Whiskey one standing by waiting for your signal. Over.
need medic on board with all his toys. Over.
it's a direct hit.
the radios are dead for good.
they're out there on their own now.
wait. What about us?
you got any contingencies?
in the event of loss of comms
during contact with the enemy,
we have 20 minutes to haul ass out of here.
what happens in 20 minutes?
smart bombs turn this place into a parking lot.
and everything in it.
so the only way that you can get out of here
is if you lure the enemy into the kill zone,
which happens to be... right?
copy that.
Oh, thank you very much.
all right, you wait here.
if I am not back in 18 minutes,
you leave by that door.
you know how to use that?
not bad for a scientist.
I've had my moments.
terrific.
we've got 17 minutes.
you want to tell me about your moments?
that game's over now. Yeah, I mean...
besides, you're the one who wants his story told, so...
how badly you want to hear it?
all right, well,
the answer's probably gonna stay in this room anyway. go on.
ask your question.
what did you do in Bosnia?
intelligence.
you seem like you don't want to really talk about it.
why is that?
well, the past is the past, right?
I can relate to that.
I know that you're trying to get some common ground
between us, all right, khaled,
but i didn't betray my country.
you betrayed something.
Yeah, I betrayed myself. How about you?
Mr. Komisky, a moment of your time?
you too, Torres.
my real name is specialist Glen Welsh.
what branch of the military were you in?
uh, back to Bosnia, your betrayal.
all right.
Sarajevo. '94.
right, we were interrogating a Serb officer
about his sniper positions.
we?
Yeah. mi6, british intelligence.
and I didn't believe him,
so we changed his clothes
and chocked him out into sniper alley.
he lasted 4 seconds,
got about 18 feet-ish.
his information was accurate.
but he was the enemy, right?
I'm a scientist. I'm not an executioner.
war got the better of you, too.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Now your turn.
I was aiming for special ops before i got there, '99,
I got in a bar fight.
they threw me in the brig for three years.
manslaughter.
I could tell you my drinks were spiked,
but what would you care, right?
right.
two years later, and this is right after 9/11,
I got jumped in the brig and was thrown in the hospital.
somebody had knifed me in my back.
that's when they offered me a way out.
that man you saw on the sat-link.
yeah?
ms. perriman.
Franko's aunt wendy?
Franko? is he alive?
where is he?
and they moved you straight from the brig hospital to a training facility, right?
Uh-huh. Where?
somewhere out west. I don't know exactly.
they didn't tell me-- you know,
it looked a lot like this hell hole.
all right, and they trained you to do what?
they taught me pashto.
they--they put me through their own brand of special ops training.
and then they dropped me in the middle of taliban territory,
posing as an aid worker with shia sympathies.
you know, they said they were gonna be watching me,
that they'd have my back
and that they'd pull me out when the time was right.
all right, but they didn't.
they never came back for you, right?
Yeah.
they betrayed you, right, so you went over to the other side.
is that it?
did you ever kill any American troops?
no.
that's a bloody lie.
no. No. Look.
look, look, you try to shoot over their heads,
but those bastards, they just keep shooting back.
what? What? What are you doing?
hold still! Hold still!
hold still!
how did the people that put you here,
how did they know how to find you?
how were they tracking you? eh?
I think I know. I think I know.
hold still! if i'm right,
this is gonna prove your story's real.
what the hell are you doing, Lightman?
all of you, you have to help me hold him still!
hold him still!
Hey, we gotta go! We gotta go right now!
not until I've done this!
you listen to orders!
I often have orders from the president.
did I forget to mention that?
now hold him still.
all right, give me the pliers.
my sister, Peg, died giving birth to Franko.
and I raised him just like he was my own.
have you two met before?
no.
what elementary school did Franko go to?
who was his first girlfriend?
ms. perriman...
I believe you really did have a sister who died in childbirth,
which is what makes your story believable...
to the layman.
it's not a story.
do you carry a picture of your nephew?
I just--I imagine over the years
of not knowing where he is
or if he's even alive,
it might be a great comfort to you,
you know, a symbol of hope top have some
that's enough.
you don't have to answer that.
they came to me after 9/11.
my sister's death didn't have to be for nothing, they said.
she's definitely telling the truth.
now, I can tell you want to get this out,
so please keep going, Ms. Perriman.
someone from the cia did come to me.
I guess it was like an acting role...for my country.
you gotta understand, I wanted
to do something.
we all wanted to do something.
including you, sir.
I believe that.
but you sent a man into Afghanistan
to infiltrate the taliban.
then what? you just forget about him?
or you just leave him there to rot?
or worse.
we lost him.
the battery in his tracking device died.
the battery? It happens.
know how hard it is to find anyone out there?
I've heard.
we kept waiting for him to show up,
and when he didn't, we assumed he was dead.
so please, take your sanctimonious judgment
and park it somewhere else.
snow.
if we don't get out of here,
it'll be the last white christmas we ever see.
not until I finish. Not until I finish. Hold on.
Hey, hey, hey, hold still!
there.
it's a tracking device.
two-year battery life.
he is one of ours.
why didn't you tell us
who you were in the beginning?
orders.
I disobey, I'm dead.
the only person I reveal my identity to is the man with the code. Nobody else!
the code is aunt wendy.
well, that's a reason.
but it's not a real reason, is it?
come on, you can do better than that.
and these bastards caught me, and they beat me.
Yeah. I was taliban.
well, that's better.
so, who are you now, eh?
you're the expert. You tell me.
you tell your mom?
no.
why not?
same reason you didn't tell me.
don't you think you should tell her?
he can tell her when he gets back.
move out! let's go, go!
let's go! move, move!
move, go!
Lightman, you're out of here!
no, no, no, no.
we saw it on your face earlier, right?
you've got orders never to let this man leave this room alive,
don't you? eh?
am i right?
these men remind you of what you wanted to be,
all right?
and so now it's about a last fight you fight
and which side of the fight you're on,
all right, and if you finally get to what you came here in the first place to do.
OK?
I need 45 seconds of fight out of him
to clear the tunnel.
Where's home?
1245 Glenview park, Iowa city.
say it again! say it again! say it again!
12245 Glenview park, Iowa city.
nice job, doc!
not really!
that's him.
heard you helped get us out.
thank you.
no. Thank you.
Dr. lightman.
Oh. The real aunt Wendy.
please don't do this.
this is a matter of national security.
what story did you people tell specialist welsh,
Franko's, family?
killed in action?
died in the brig?
Oh, died in the brig. Nice one.
I was serving my country.
Oh, yeah? Our country, you mean.
it's our country.
it's about time you let that one go, mate.
you go public with this, you'll be breaking the law.
I'm not going public with it.
I'm gonna tell a man's family
the truth about their son.
you know what I mean.
you know... sooner or later
you got to stand up and be counted for our mistakes, right?
your man, Franko, he went over...
to the taliban.
that's a big mistake.
but in the end...
you know what I mean?
Mr. Welsh?
Yeah, but what's going on out here?
who are you?
who is it, hon?
do you mind if if come in for a minute?
there's a few things I'd like to tell you
about your son, Glen.
do you mind?
happy holidays.
Dr. Lightman...
would you let me do the talking?
just so long as it's the truth.
he's late.
Yeah. Midwest is snowed under.
delays everywhere.
Yeah. My mom's stuck in St. Louis.
what are you gonna you do?
Hi.
Hello, darling.
I know.
you shouldn't have had to see that, em.
I was scared, dad.
I was really scared.
I know. Yeah.
Yeah, me, too. Me, too.
so is it naive to ask you, beg you really, never to do anything like that again?
no.
well, yeah. It's a little bit.
Oy.
well, let's share some of that.
all right.
Aw... it's beautiful.
well, darling...
are you ok?
I'm not sure.
good. You're not meant to be.
Hey.
you look nice...
thank you.
I got you a secret santa.
I'm watching you.
Oh, man.
Yeah. Don't mention it.
some of the best poker players in the world
let's meet your host, the most powerful man on the Las Vegas strip, the owner of the Nouveau Royale hotel and Casino,
how are you?
let's meet the players.
first up is the lovely Poppy Wells.
poppy brings a sizeable chip stack and quite a view to the final table.
and here comes the Russian playboy
I appreciate your help, Mr. Tostevin.
Hey, I get paid for my services, kid.
no thanks required.
get a good night's sleep.
the hard work starts tomorrow, ok?
in his sixth final table appearance,
it is my honor to introduce to you, from Springfield, Massachusetts, poker legend Mason Brock.
shut up!
what are you doing here?
what do you mean, what am I doing here?
you have no right to ask me what I'm doing here.
it's none of your business.
after a nail-biter showdown with Ricky Nguyen to make it to this final table, here comes the rock star of the South American poker scene, Amadeo valdez.
get out of here!
and last, but definitely not least,
the lone amateur to make it to the final table,
the golden boy from evergreen park, Illinois.
Where's that, you ask? No one knows.
this kid came out of nowhere to sweep through the early rounds in a merge as chip leader.
it's been 3 months since he conquered over 6, 000 players to make it to this, the final table of the 2009 poker world championship.
ladies and gentlemen, - - Missing.
and you lot are the prime suspects in his disappearance.
I'll be damned. Never thought I'd live to see it.
see what?
the day they let cal Lightman back in Vegas.
if you don't cooperate fully with Dr. Lightman, you won't be at the final table when we go live in 32 hours.
you got it? They're all yours.
professional liars.
that's a treat.
I think I'll start with Jake first, actually.
I'd like to see his room, meet the missis.
Cal, there is a time pressure here, and if anyone from the final table is involved,
worst case, I lose my gaming license.
Oh, we can't have that, can we?
here's the deal.
you find Jake, get him to the final table, there's a half a million bonus in it for you.
why is he so important to you, again?
I just told you.
so what's the history with these two?
Ellis had Lightman banned from Vegas.
the entire city?
Cal won a lot of money from some very important customers.
his scientific abilities weren't considered sporting.
well, you ban somebody from an entire city, that's personal.
well, there may have been a situation with Ellis' girlfriend at the time.
Vegas doesn't bring out the best in Cal.
Ben, keep an eye on him while we're here and don't let him gamble, ok?
Why? So he won't win?
he wins at poker, but it's no fun for him.
what's his game?
roulette. Unpredictable, purely driven by chance, and the worst odds in the casino.
God, I miss this.
think I'll put a bet on...
I did not bring you here to indulge your bad habits, and you will be stopped if you try to leave my property.
what, you don't want your buddies to find out?
it's Vegas. They already know.
but it's better for the both of us if you keep a low profile.
that's my cue. I'll see you suckers later.
no, no, where are you going?
Hey, a free private plane ride to Vegas.
my mama ain't raised no fool.
and as far as I can tell, there's no crime here, so...
Hey, I brought you here to work.
Yeah, I'll work when there's something for me to do.
but until then, right now I'm feeling lucky, ok?
Hey, I'm not done with you yet.
say it... "but I'm done with you." Say it loud.
but I'm done with you.
good. Now, take this.
put it all on double zero on the roulette, will you?
Yeah, all of it. All of it?
Yeah. The whole thing.
don't let Foster find out?
all right?
do you believe that guy?
come on, let's get going.
your husband is a star.
Jake would never just leave us.
he loves us. Please find him.
I think you should just call the police.
if you think that's necessary, Cal, but I think you're more than qualified to find him yourself.
this one told you not to, didn't he?
macey just didn't think it was necessary once I hired you.
well, here's the thing.
Mr. Ellis here doesn't want the police involved because you're husband's a commodity, one he's put a lot of effort into packaging.
he wants him back at the final table, but without the bad publicity.
he said the police wouldn't take me seriously.
people wander off in Vegas all the time,
he said.
you know, well, that bit's true... too.
I just wanted us all to be clear on our motives here.
there's a young man missing.
one job is Vegas isn't going to turn me back into an inveterate gambler.
things change. - But people don't.
you're smothering. There's no smothering in Vegas.
tell me about the last time you saw your husband.
2 nights ago.
he'd been running practice hands for hours, and I was going to bed, and he said he had to run to the lobby and meet one of the other players.
that's it.
I think you're right. I don't think your husband would leave on his own.
he loves us so much, me and the baby.
also, he loves this.
all right. You four are some of the best liars in the world, right?
well, you have to be, otherwise you wouldn't be sitting at this table, would you?
I've got to tell you up front, it's not gonna be a fair fight.
I mean, you can dodge all you like, but come down to it, I'm gonna win.
just ask Mason what it's like to tangle with me.
it used to be a hell of a lot more fun in the old days, Cal.
either finding himself in God or losing himself in a woman.
search the bunny ranch.
the old-timer's got a point there.
I'll be right back.
here. You are a winner, my friend.
nice work. It was double zero, right?
Nah, I wasn't feeling that. I put it on 14, my mother's birthday.
I told you to put it all on double zero.
so you'd rather lose with your number than win with mine?
Yeah. Something like that, yeah.
Yeah, that makes no sense.
yeah?
go back, do it again.
go on, buzz off.
TCH.
right. Uh...
well, let's, uh, start with you, Mason.
what did you do to the kid?
the kid's no threat to me. Why would I do anything to him?
well, an empty chair at the table earns you an extra 500 grand, plus a better shot at the the other half million.
everyone here wins or loses millions every day. No big deal.
vas thinks he's unbeatable.
I am. How many investors do you have, hmm?
I don't need money from other people to back me.
that's why I'm the best.
Yeah, even after 5 vodka tonics?
all right, what does it say about you lot that an Illinois farm boy and slaughter you?
so I'm leaving work early, maybe get a pedicure on the way home.
it's good we're not in Vegas.
Oh, I can catch up on my reading.
I have a date tonight.
a third date.
come on.
sorry, Doug.
with a girl?
a human girl?
you're so... not funny.
foster's sent us a video file to score.
Oh, one file shouldn't take too long.
Oh, no.
I hope your date's patient.
you feeling a little guilty there, Poppy?
am I feeling guilty?
or sad?
they're quite similar, aren't they?
Jake is my friend. Shouldn't I be feeling sad that he's missing?
what happened to him?
do you miss Vegas?
no.
well...
yeah... no, I lied.
Yeah.
Yeah, just a little bit.
don't tell anyone, right?
you can trust me.
tell me the truth.
can't you see the truth?
you can't, can you?
you can't read me and you like that.
you like my poker face, Dr. Lightman?
OK, the truth.
Jake's had 3 months to imagine playing at the final table and everything it means. His whole life is gonna change.
he trusted you.
so I met him at a little place down the strip, made him feel better for half an hour, and left.
how many times in the last 3 months did you manipulate his confidence in the guise of being his friend?
I wouldn't manipulate Jake.
excellent. That's righteous indignation.
it's also total nonsense.
I think you worked him.
I think you'd do everything you could to convince him that winning was more of a curse than a blessing to get an advantage at the final table.
I mean, it's brilliant, as far as strategies go.
maybe I shouldn't have told you.
well, you had to. You needed me to trust you, right, so you shared a half-truth.
a call just came in to the production phone.
go ahead, Bob. Play it back.
we have Jake Hartman.
we will return him for $2 million.
this is a very small amount of money compared to what the casino earns.
we'd advise that you not tell the police.
we will call back in 3 hours.
Mrs. Hartman, kidnapping makes this a federal case,
and I've got the las Vegas FBI field office running at full speed.
why would anyone take my husband?
well, most likely it's someone who knows that Mr. Ellis is willing to pay
the money is being bagged as we speak.
and I'll be analyzing the ransom call.
we're gonna figure out who did this.
we're gonna do everything we can to get your husband back.
Where's Dr. Lightman?
why $2 million, eh?
I mean, Ellis is willing to pay it, but $2 million?
is that rage, Mr. Valdez?
no.
but you're upset, aren't you, that Ellis is willing to drop 2 million to get the kid back? Is that it?
how long is this gonna take?
me and my boys, we have a club opening to get to.
all this guy cares about is cash and parties.
no respect for the game.
go lose some money. Go on, buzz off.
she's too good for you.
the way she walks, she's too good for anyone.
that's not nice, Poppy.
nice isn't fun.
Oh! Look at that.
that's what we call a macro-expression.
she may as well stick her tongue down his throat.
no, she wants something from him.
well, maybe she's just attracted to him.
you are such an innocent, Loker.
tell me, this girl that you're dating, where do you take her?
tonight, Luigi's.
last week, Meridiana, the week before that...
no, no, no, no. You're doing this all wrong. How do you not I know this?
OK, I know a lot... about dating.
you think you are getting lucky tonight, don't you?
well, you are not.
100 bucks says she's dating you for the 5-star food.
OK. If we're gonna bet,
I want your office for one week.
well, in that case, I want your ant farm.
it's a bet.
I'm letting Amadeo go.
no, no, don't do that.
the ransom call is loaded with syntactical anomalies.
I'd expect more use of idiom for one thing, and it seems almost edited.
I think the person we're looking for's first language isn't English.
well, I'm getting nothing from him.
well, what are you getting from her, other than lust?
excuse me?
well, she's still a suspect.
she's the female equivalent of roulette.
and you like the view.
it's a very nice view.
you're smothering me.
Amadeo, wake up, wake up.
you can go.
are you seriously keeping me here?
Yes. I should consider that a compliment, Mason.
Adios, amigos.
Adios.
well, I'm happy to stay near Ms. Foster.
Yeah, I'll bet you are.
the kidnappers just called with the ransom drop.
all right, let's go.
that's our guy coming out with the ransom money.
all right, the bag is in place. Let me get a ready from everybody.
ready. Ready. All ready.
all right, listen up. The kidnappers will know that there's surveillance cameras covering this whole area.
they'll have a strategy.
keep your eyes open. Stay focused.
Oh, hey, before I forget...
you're a big winner.
Congratulations.
double zero, right?
Yeah, double zero.
what number did you bet on?
Hey, it's Michael Jordan and Lebron James' number.
what do you want me to do?
I told you double zero. Here.
listen, do you not get that I'm Mr. Lucky?
do you want to lose?
you do not walk up to a roulette table and just bet it on double zero.
you gotta feel it out.
nonsense.
Yeah, well, this stack of money in my hand says otherwise. Hold up.
what are Amadeo's boys doing here?
hailing a taxi?
Oh, listen up. I did some digging.
the day before Jake disappeared, Amadeo switched rooms.
his new room is right next to Jake's.
Amadeo's not involved in this.
well, it looks like you just got played, doc.
these have gotta be the dumbest kidnappers.
move in, move in.
get out of the cab! FBI!
put your hands on the roof.
turn around!
put your hands on the roof!
open up!
open up!
put your hands up!
put your hands where I can see 'em!
put your damn hands up.
what is this?
you know what the hell this is. Cuff him!
why are you doing this?
what?
he's meticulous.
footage of the other players.
he's been studying them.
fixing onto us to pick up the ransom?
you're not too swift.
who's in the next room?
Jake. I told you that already.
no, no, no.
no.
not that one.
that one.
you know what my favorite poker phrase is?
I don't know. All in? Open limp?
the nuts?
on tilt.
it's so expressive.
you want a pull. It's Amadeo's.
I don't drink.
Yeah, you do.
only an amateur lets frustration Interfere with his game theory.
you think?
here.
have a drink.
I insist.
that's right. It's water.
oldest trick in the book.
but Amadeo sold you, didn't he?
he's a liar.
Yeah.
he's a fantastic liar, actually.
when you thought he was partying next door, he was wearing noise-reduction headphones, mapping out a strategy for every possible hand.
Amadeo knows every play at that final table inside and out.
but you're the one he considers a threat.
guess I'm flattered.
fake drinking, constant talk of partying.
changing his room to torture you with hideous music.
it's all calculated to drive you nuts.
he wanted your tilt at the final table.
no, but he will.
well, maybe I can be the hero of the day, then.
this... was taken earlier this afternoon.
watch Mason's hands.
now you see the cell phone, now you don't.
and now you do again.
we've got it all on video, Mason.
you palmed Amadeo's cell phone and texted his boys to pick up the ransom bag.
I'm not making it to the final table, am I?
no. Afraid not.
come on, it was a prank.
I messed with Amadeo, he messed with me.
that's not a prank. That's a crime.
it wasn't about the money, though, was it?
you didn't think that Amadeo deserved to sit at the final table with you.
he's a punk. He doesn't take the game seriously.
well, that's what I thought, anyway.
he played this old gambler but good, didn't he?
who did you get to make the ransom calls?
some drunken tourist.
did you have anything to do with Jake's disappearance?
no. 40 years ago that boy was me.
hell, even I'm rooting for him.
not to be smothering,
but are you ok?
well, you've known Mason a long time.
no, I knew him a long time ago.
that's a completely different thing.
I mean, he took a gamble and he lost.
his choice.
speaking of gambles...
you enjoying the show?
very much.
word is Ellis is having you followed because he doesn't want you fleecing his big customers.
you really that good at harpooning whales?
I used to be.
hmm, we should play sometime.
my guess is we already are.
if your friend Foster as suspicious as you?
more so.
she doesn't like me.
not at all.
she fears women like you bring out the worst in me.
promise?
what is it?
I'm not quite sure.
fancy a field trip?
is your bodyguard still out there?
Hey, how you doing? You all right?
Yep.
do you still keep your ladies down at the bar at the Nouveau Royale?
you do? How many you got?
I'll take 3.
Yeah. You send them up to, um, the 28th floor.
Yeah.
and just tell him that, um, he's getting married tomorrow.
Yeah. How long?
Yeah, 15 minutes. 15 minutes, yeah.
that's good.
all right. Yeah, we'll talk.
all right, put it on my account.
what are we gonna do for 15 minutes?
you only take me to the best places.
Yeah.
can we ever just have a normal conversation?
Oh, God. What is that smell?
Oh, my God.
you got the note early this morning?
Yep.
Uh-huh. In your room?
kind of ingenious, don't you think?
foster, why can't you take it easy? We're in Vegas.
I was happy to help.
she was.
Dr. Foster, thank you for the call.
sure.
how was it with the ladies? Was it good?
is it Jake?
it's Abe Tostevin.
he was one of the best poker coaches in the country back in the day.
so what happened? - He died.
abe had a knack for pissing people off.
a few years ago Vegas became untenable.
he worked with most of the greats until he nosedived.
abe wouldn't show his face near the championship.
well, in addition to Jake Hartman being a missing person, he's now also a murder suspect.
you cared about him.
he gave me the only advice I ever needed.
tatas on the table.
won me a lot of pots.
OK, now, look at the contraction of the orbicularis oculi pars lateralis.
with the smile,
that's classic action unit 6.
she's so into me.
but, looking for someone better to talk to.
that's bad.
the universal signal for "I want you."
case closed. I win.
Loker, I'm gonna let you in on one of the true rules of womanhood.
cool.
if a guy's boring you, like you want to stick a fork in your eye boring, a good lip lick can rattle him enough to change the conversation topic.
no.
I was going on about the herd mentality in the Kenyan elk population.
I'm not getting your office for a week, am I?
Nope.
Ingrid's not dating me, she is dating my restaurant choices.
Yep.
Oh, well.
treat them well.
abe Tostevin is dead.
I thought that this was about Jake.
Yeah, it is.
how'd you feel about Abe being back in town?
I met him once in Monte Carlo.
you mean drunk?
you ever see Abe and Jake together?
no.
but I saw Abe 2 days ago. We had lunch together.
well, you could have told me about that earlier.
you didn't ask before.
anything else you're keeping from me?
your partner makes me light in the head.
well, I have to begin my pregame ritual, so...
why don't you come and have blueberry pancakes with me?
you're not going anywhere. Sit down.
that's a bit naughty, isn't it?
hitting on Foster here while your girlfriend's sitting right there.
you two are, uh, you're, you know, sleeping together, are you?
move on.
Oh, I get it.
I get it. You guys...
you are the best liars in the world.
someone tell me something.
which is now off.
arrest Poppy.
for what?
murder.
you're joking. He's joking.
can I talk to you?
she's a murderer. Arrest her.
you sure this isn't one of your double zero bets?
all right, come on, stand up.
put your hands behind your back.
you're under arrest for the murder of Abe Tostevin.
you know, you probably want to call a lawyer about this.
of course, you wont be able to make bail till Monday.
after the final table.
Cal, I know you're mad at me, but don't do this.
mad? What, should I be mad?
I know I'd be mad.
are you gonna stop this?
you started it. You're gonna have to stop it.
fine.
fine.
Jake wanted Macey to know he was ok, but he didn't think it was safe to call her, so he called my cell.
truth at last. When?
an hour before we got together.
to be delivered in the morning when you planned to be with me, above suspicion, right?
I was gonna tell you all about it after the championship was over.
how thoughtful.
why is Jake hiding? What's he so afraid of?
no idea.
you seemed genuinely surprised when you saw Abe's body.
Jake just said he saw something awful.
that's it. I didn't know it was Abe.
if Jake called from wherever he's holed up, a trace will lead us right to him.
you let Jake's wife carry on thinking he was, what, dead or worse.
you really are a hawk with a bunny rabbit, aren't you?
I studied the numbers and made my decision, same as always.
Jake? It's me, baby. Let me in.
what are you doing?
it's all right now.
all right?
I just wanted it to be over.
which part, the fame or the fortune?
as soon as I made the final table, my life changed.
Yeah, knowing you were about to win at least $1. 5 million, that really sucks.
I didn't know who to trust. Everyone's different.
is that you talking or is that Poppy?
I just want our old life back.
I don't even know this Abe guy.
Yeah, but you knew where to find his body.
I stumbled across it.
also you stumbled across the trunk of his car?
you know we found the murderer, right?
you did?
Yeah.
no, I lied.
when I lie, sometimes I do this.
you... when you lie, you do this.
I think Poppy got close enough to you to figure that out.
the others, I don't know, maybe.
that little move, the right cards in your hand, you could make, what?
8 and a half million?
look, I don't care what you think you know.
I'm not risking my family's safety.
and I don't know anybody named Abe.
stay tuned for more of the poker world championship...
all right, cut.
excuse me.
do it again.
if you wanted me in handcuffs, you could have just asked.
we found Jake.
he was hiding out.
he saw Abe's murder. He just got scared.
so, who did it?
what do you care?
it's nothing to you, right?
it turns out Jake doesn't know who did it.
he just freaked out. He...
his wife wants him to play the final table, though.
but I don't think he'll budge.
I'd say too bad, but...
poppy, you're up.
stay tuned for more of the poker world championship.
what if she doesn't take the bait?
she will.
maybe there's time for Ben to run to the casino while we wait.
you think I didn't know?
Gillian, your really gotta learn to embrace this town.
it was just a couple of bets for old times' sake.
it was you, wasn't it?
what are you talking about?
we had a deal.
you and me, first and second place at the final table.
the deal stands.
not if you killed Abe.
I told you he didn't know about us.
the bastard could read you like a book.
why do you think he asked you to lunch, huh?
old times' sake?
he cared about me.
he was coaching another player. He wanted information.
are you really that stupid?
are you?
you just kill a man because you think maybe he knows something?
Yeah. Going to cost me $15 million.
you really did it?
you killed him?
not me. One of my investors from Moscow.
I'm calling the police.
we're good.
she's in trouble.
hold it right there, Vas!
stop!
you hold it right there!
have you had enough?
have you had enough?
stay still.
so how did you know she'd go there?
it was in her own best interest.
some people don't change.
so you knew she had information the whole time and you still slept with her?
that's not why I slept with her.
you all right?
we're live in 2 hours.
perfection, people.
I want double.
my bonus for bringing Jake back to the final table... double it.
he says he's not showing up.
Oh, he'll show up.
Why?
cause he was coaching Jake.
you already knew that, didn't you?
that's why you brought him back to town.
I paid for his ticket out.
Yeah. Yeah. And you paid for mine, too.
yet here I am,'cause you need me.
well, I didn't need Abe.
what, you didn't want him to coach Jake, just give him that little extra edge?
I don't get involved on that level.
because the integrity of the championship is paramount.
Yes, it is.
Oh. Right.
next year, every hayseed in America is going to be plopping down 20 grand to enter.
I didn't bring Abe back to Vegas.
see, you hired me as a lie expert, and then you lied to me.
double it.
medium triple latte.
Thanks.
how long you been watching that?
not long.
I lied.
she likes you.
nice try.
but I saw the lip lick.
the, uh, true rule of womanhood.
Loker, there's no such thing as true rule of womanhood.
I made it up.
and I wanted the ant farm.
I am smug?
well, how do I know you're telling the truth now?
not only is she laughing, she's looking right into your eyes.
she's being polite.
this isn't being polite.
her pupils were dilated.
well, she did... touch my knee at one point.
so you think I should... call her and...
definitely.
crazy things happen in the desert,
let's get started and introduce them to you.
it's not easy being leader, and that's true of our current chip leader, the lone amateur at this final table.
the golden boy from Evergreen Park, Illinois.
Where's that, you ask? No one knows.
this kid came out of nowhere to sweep through the early rounds...
Hey, Ben.
Hey, wow. You...
you look great.
Yeah, you, too. I mean...
the dress, the shoes, the whole thing.
lovely.
I thought I should embrace the Vegas.
ladies and gentlemen, Jake Hartman!
no, no, no, no, no.
I'm not interested in gambling.
do you really think that that's all this town has to offer?
just wait and see. I'm gonna blow your mind.
I'm gonna go get the car and I'll met you out front.
first-class service for you all the way.
just for you.
and now, the 23rd poker world championship...
shuffle up and deal!
how you doin', Gordie?
living the life, Dr. Lightman.
I'm told you got a one-night pass to the casino.
one million dollars compliments of Mr. Ellis.
all of it on double zero.
Hi, Foster.
lying lands you right here.
smack dab in front of me.
when it comes to lying, I'm your man.
that makes Dr. Lightman very special.
so, since you dragged me away from my work, who can tell me what a lie is?
when my mom tells my dad he's not getting a big belly?
Yeah. Right. We learn to lie from grown-ups.
they think you don't notice, but you do.
most of the time lying is bad, right?
even if you think you're doing it for a good reason.
trust me, life's a lot easier if you learn to tell the truth.
Lightman is miserable.
what strings did you pull to get him to do this?
I had Emily ask. She tutors a couple of the kids.
thought I could turn our class problem into a teachable moment.
that'd be a help.
so, even if you're just thinking of not telling me the truth,
I'll warn you. It's pretty hard to keep a lie from me.
go on. Go on, I dare you.
eh? Right. Clyde the turtle.
which one of you stole clyde the turtle...
from miss angela's classroom? Eh?
no takers?
all of you are innocent, are you? Eh?
we need to talk.
all right. Good. Boys and girls,
meet FBI agent benjamin reynolds.
Oh, hey, kids, how ya doing?
Hey, agent Ben.
we need to talk. Foster's waiting.
you, too. Come on.
all right.
Oh, and by the way,
whoever it is that stole clyde the turtle,
the turtle's--they're like lettuce, or is that tortoises?
I'm gonna work on that one.
take a look at this screen.
this guy parked right in front of the treasury department annex.
that's like two blocks from here.
Yeah.
how long's he been there?
little under 15 minutes.
anybody consider this might be a peaceful protest?
a crazy farmer named Harold Clark...is driving up to Washington D.C. to blow you federal folks up.
how do you know this? - He's got his tractor and trailer packed...
with enough explosives to blow up the whole town.
so not a peaceful protest then?
Yeah. - Who's the caller?
we don't know yet.
the call was relayed here, but the subscriber information didn't convey.
we're waiting to retrieve it now.
is there anything else to support...the fact that he actually has a bomb in there?
that's what we need you all for.
so the question at hand is, is the threat real or is it a hoax?
we need to get these kids out of here now.
no. We're not doing that. Protocol is anyone within the bomb radius...
stays inside and away from exterior windows.
in situations like these more people are killed...by flying glass than the blast itself.
Plus, this guy, he may be waiting for people...to evacuate just so he can trigger it.
so, everyone - including those kids
is staying right here until we can figure this thing out.
I was hoping you were going to say that.
all right. I've got us tapped into the bureau's cameras.
all right. Tight as you can.
tighter.
all right. Come on, come on.
so, what do we know about this man?
it's like the caller said, the guy's name is Harold Clark. He has - well, he had a family farm...
right outside fredericksburg, virginia. But it's now in foreclosure.
he definitely seems agitated.
no, he's anxious.
Yeah, which I might be if the president didn't take my call.
Oh, come on. You know that's not gonna happen.
no, what I'm saying is I'm not seeing mad bomber anxiety here.
do you have any of your agents going on to this guy's farm?
Yeah, from the richmond office.
Where's Torres?
do you think she's ready to handle this on her own?
no, but we seem to be under lockdown here, so I'm willing to lower the bar. Where is she?
helping set up her cousin's quinceanera.
Ah. Well, hold the cake.
let's send her down to the farmhouse.
let's see what his family thinks of this little field trip.
what about the kids?
I'm all over it.
OK, you guys, let's go. Quietly.
wait. come here, you.
hand it over.
Yeah. Nice try, son.
that's how I got it.
we need you all in the conference room, ok?
Why?
because it's awesome.
come on.
go after him. Go on.
let's go.
is something wrong?
we have a bit of a situation.
we just need you all away from any windows.
Hey, 8 third-graders...in a room with no toys and no puppies?
it's going to be chaos.
Yeah. Speaking of puppies, You like kids, don't you?
no. - Ok.
boys and girls, this is crazy uncle Loker.
he's going to be continuing our education on lying.
for how long?
as long as it takes.
Torres is en route.
Oh. This is my boss, Asac Steele.
Dr. Cal Lightman.
yo. Steele. Thanks for letting us set up here.
all right, my office, My science you're obviously after.
it's under my command. Ok?
where are we doing this?
I have some information you need to hear.
all right.
optical chemical sensors are picking up traces
of ammonium nitrates and diesel fuel from the trailer.
aren't those pretty standard farmyard smells?
Yes, but he could also have an anfo bomb big enough
to take out several blocks of Downtown D. C. - Right.
collateral damage-wise there's a pretty strong case here
for death by sniper, wouldn't you say?
I mean, you only need to be 30% sure he's got a bomb,
then just kill him, taking one human life
by saving thousands of others,
including those kids in there.
you're the expert. That's the call you're going to have to make.
what? Do I look like an fbi puppet to you?
your offices, your command, you're the one who said that.
Yeah, I did say that.
all right. No, thanks.
come on, look, look, look.
my boss is a really good guy, ok?
but he's not equipped to figure this thing out the you are.
so, come on, man. We need to know.
does that guy have a bomb in a trailer or not?
all right.
all right. Well, if I'm going to do this, I'll need to deal with him personally,
so can you put me through?
we have our own negotiators. Bombers have a messiah complex so...
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Avoid discussion of the bomber's...Present crisis in order to prevent him...
from exercising his god-like power to destroy and kill...
Yeah. I wrote that bit in the manual.
is that true?
well, when you're ready...
all right.
hello.
Harold, I'm Cal Lightman.
do you have the president with you?
no, no, not right now,
but I'm calling at his request.
call me back when you got him.
what do I know?
yes?
who are you?
may we come inside, ma'am?
my friends are here.
Oh, this won't take long.
we are live outside the treasury department annex in northwest Washington D.C. Where a disgruntled...
has Harold ever talked about taking action against the government?
Mrs. Clark?
he complained, you know, like everyone else about taxes and the economy. I just, uh...
I can't believe he's up there in damn D. C.With his tractor.
so you did not know that he was going to go do this today?
no. No.
he talked about, um...
maybe going up there with a megaphone
and, uh, calling out them bastards in the treasury department, but not this.
it sounds like Harold's pretty angry.
you're damn right he's pissed.
they took his family farm.
three generations, they had it.
ma'am, it's not a huge leap from anger to violence.
does he have a bomb in that trailer he towed?
you listen to me - Harold and I have been together since sophomore year in high school.
I know this man.
he would never hurt anyone.
you didn't answer the question, ma'am.
no, he doesn't have a damn bomb. He just...
he just wants to talk to the president.
you don't believe that.
otherwise, you wouldn't have fear all over your face.
I'm not afraid of what he's going to do.
I'm afraid of what you all are going to do to him.
so, unless you have a search warrant to be here,
I'd really like it if you'd leave my home.
I can get a warrant in 10 minutes.
then get it.
reading emotions helps us discover lies.
who wants to tell me what emotion this person is feeling?
this one and that one.
hmm?
contempt.
I don't think they know what that is.
is this really science? It seems dumb.
we were supposed to leave half an hour ago.
why are we still here?
now's when we have music class.
Yeah.
isn't this better than music class?
no.
Dr. Cal!
they want to know why they're here...
instead of back in music class, which is where they normally are at this time.
it's my fault. I told your bus driver to go and pick up a couple of friends of mine at the airport.
and the plane was late, so he's stuck there waiting for them. Sorry about that.
are you allowed to do that?
Yeah, I got permission from your principal.
you know, someone in here is definitely lying
about Clyde the turtle. I can smell it.
Loker, get your guitar, entertain the troops.
Oh, it's torres.
I spoke to Harold's wife.
she's definitely hiding something.
did you ask her about the bomb?
Yeah, but she doesn't believe he has one.
who ever heard of a husband keeping secrets from his wife?
the only thing I know for sure is she doesn't believe he's violent.
well, keep after it, all right?
Hello?
Harold, I've got a question for you.
call me when you're ready to let me speak with the president.
Yeah, well, he wants to know what you want to talk about.
is it global warming? Death penalty? What?
I want to talk about our tax money being sent overseas, or bailing out banks,
but letting our farmers choke on their own crops.
somebody's got to stand up and say something.
all right. Well, I'll pass that on.
in the meantime, could you answer a question for me?
Yeah, what is it?
all right. What kind of bomb are we talking about?
what?
well, there's a rumor going on around here that you're sitting on a bomb.
is this you trying to change the subject?
no, no, we spoke to your wife. She was a little off.
I want the president.
let me replay that.
what?
when you asked him if he had a bomb,
the left side of his lip tightened.
it's contempt.
he's being deceptive.
so you're giving us the green light.
what is it with you people? Why is it always red light, green light?
what do you want me to do? Pull the trigger for you?
wait, wait, let me explain something to you.
I'm trying to save innocent lives here, your included.
all right? There are no easy choices here.
so let's all act like grownups,
make the hard choices, and salvage what we can.
right. Well, what I'm telling you is that he's being
deceptive in his denial of having a bomb.
I don't know yet what that means exactly.
it's good enough for me.
do it and I'll prep the snipers.
all right. So once you're in place,
concealed and on target, sound off.
let's follow all protocols on this.
no happy triggers.
Roger that, sir.
do you guys have to do this in the lobby?
we've got a bunch of kids here we've managed to keep in the dark so far.
until I give the word, You are not authorized to shoot...
unless someone's in immediate danger. You got that?
we'll be waiting for your green light.
then get going. - Yes, sir!
a little mood lighting?
Yeah, the ballasts on the fluorescent lights
interferes with our video and encrypted radio communications.
all right, we're good to go.
now you've got some semblance of a rapport with Harold.
keep him distracted while the snipers move in, ok?
Oh, that's nice.
remind me to renegotiate my contract with you.
we appreciate what you're doing, doctor.
Yes, I know you do.
Hello?
Harold. Me again.
I spoke with the president's office.
when can I talk to him?
well, you need to promise me
that no one's going to get hurt here.
I don't want anybody to get hurt.
that was genuine.
so I'll work with that or I'm done here, all right?
I believe you when you say that,
but I don't think that you're telling me the whole truth about the bomb.
quit stalling.
did you tell the president what I wanted to talk about?
Yeah, I did. I told him.
but he wants to know what it is that you want him to do.
I'll tell him on the phone.
is your wife involved in this?
no, no, this is all me. Quit playing games.
right.
OK. Seats 4, we're going to have a concert.
OK.
how dangerous is it out there?
how dangerous is it in here?
I don't know.
but I trust Lightman. And it's my job to keep these kids from freaking out.
what if their teacher is freaked out?
well, I'll help her, too...
but you've got to help me with them first, ok?
OK.
OK.
who knows the words to "puff, the magic dragon"?
my mom said that song's about illegal drugs.
I don't think that's ever been definitively proven.
all sniper teams in position.
all right. Copy that.
you can go ahead and try and engage him. We're ready.
you have the president?
all right, Harold, a little reality check here.
your situation is veering from bad to worse by the minute.
I'm getting cold, and I'm getting angry.
I don't want to talk to you anymore.
well, that's unfortunate, Because I'm the only person here
who has any desire to talk to you.
I just want to talk to the president.
well, let's start with the truth then.
what kind of bomb are we talking about here?
the bomb is rigged.
how?
it just is, ok?
if you do anything to me, You try to hurt me, the bomb goes off.
and if I don't speak directly to the president before the sun goes down,
the bomb goes off!
look, man, all that can be avoided if you just have the president call me.
is he telling the truth?
Yeah.
Yeah, I believe he is.
but he's also showing fear.
all right, it's the kind of fear that you get when someone's got a gun to your head.
believe me, I've seen that.
you know what, zoom into that tractor seat. Go ahead.
Yeah. Lower.
lower. keep going, keep going...right there...
Oh, god.
we didn't see it before because his jacket was in the way.
sniper one to base.
all sniper teams in position. We're waiting for green light.
just hold your position, sniper team.
you are not cleared to fire. Stand down.
sniper one is clear. Standing down.
if this guy has a detonator switch on his seat,
and if we fire, that might detonate the bomb.
let's use an lvb water disrupter.
is that what I think it is?
it's a bomb we bring in to kill his bomb.
Oh, this is just getting better and better, this is.
I found something on the 911 call, you should hear.
a crazy farmer named Harold Clark is driving up to Washington D.C. to blow you federal folks up.
one more time.
a crazy farmer named Harold Clark is driving up to Washington D.C. to blow you federal folks up.
all right, just that last little bit.
blow you federal folks up.
do you hear it?
Yeah, he's smiling.
what?
the inflection of his voice changes...
because a smile changes the sound of your voice by shortening the voice resonance chamber.
he's smiling as he says "blow you federal folks up."
wait, you can tell someone's smiling just by listening to him?
you can't. We can.
he know something you don't and he's laughing at you.
so what is this, a practical joke?
no, I think he's telling the truth.
he finds some kind of sick humor in this.
he may be connected to this.
Yeah.
Harold is not working on his own.
we need to find this guy quick.
no, I get it, I do.
you're looking for someone to blame in case this thing goes south, right?
that's why you set up your command center in my office, effectively putting my finger on the trigger.
well, what do you say we make sure before you just go ahead and kill him?
are you done?
because constitutionally speaking, You don't have to be right to use deadly force,
we just have to be reasonably sure.
and in a world full of bombs and lunatics...
sometimes there's no room for scientific certainty.
you know, you're so scared of making a huge mistake, You're prepared to make a smaller. - Yet potentially still tragic one. - You want this to end peacefully?
you give me proof and allow me to do that.
all right. The 911 caller was just id'd as Ron Jackson.
white male, 38, lives near harold in virginia.
boss, we've got time.
we should get Torres and one of your agents over there right now.
Yeah.
in this situation stalling and not making a decision
is the same thing as making one.
well, I want to be certain of the truth when I make my decision.
well, you better make it soon...
because the clock is ticking on that bomb.
bomb? What bomb?
he had to go to the bathroom.
you're a big kid, right?
you're not going to turn into one of them...
whiny little cry babies, are you?
right. No?
all right.
here's the truth.
all right?
not far from here there's a man who says he's got a bomb.
he's trying to get some people's attention.
now, maybe he has and maybe he's lying.
but, in the meantime, you and your mates,
you're going to stay here, just to be on the safe side.
you got it? All right.
now, it's my job to find out what's what
with this maybe-maybe not bomb type thing,
and I'm excellent at my job.
just ask Loker here.
and it's your job to be a top-notch third-grader.
you up for it? Huh?
you up for keeping this a secret from your mates,
so that they don't get all, you know, scaredy cat on you?
good. All right.
well, go pee then.
excuse me.
what can I do for you?
I'm looking for Ron Jackson. Is he your husband?
don't remind me.
wait, ma'am. FBI.
where is he, ma'am? We need to talk to him.
sorry, I thought y'all were bill collectors.
Where's your husband, ma'am?
honestly, I got no idea. What's he done now?
you know a man named Harold Clark?
Yeah. I guess everyone knows harold now.
how do you know him?
him and ron run a farmers' co-op.
they mostly get together, drink, and bitch about things.
all right we take a look around, ma'am?
Yeah, we ain't got nothin' to hide.
blasting caps for bombs.
all right, look, just hear me out, ok? Maybe Jackson was an accomplice,
but he got cold feet, decided to call 911, and give up the whole plot.
that doesn't explain the smile behind his voice.
what is that?
Oh, that.
that's how these boys plan to win this.
it doesn't look like much, but...
all right, look, here's the deal, ok?
we're going to place that container of water near Harold's bomb.
there's a large quantity of c-4 in the middle of the container,
which we will then detonate, sending the water out at 72 million psi.
it will disrupt harold's bomb before it can explode.
and harold's birdfeed.
he won't even know what hit him.
Oh, this is going to be fun.
what the hell is that thing coming towards me?
it's an x-ray machine, Harold.
we needed to map the bomb...
so we can figure out a safe evacuation plan.
tell me about Ron Jackson.
you know about ron?
Yep.
better still, why don't you tell me how to disable the bomb so nobody gets hurt.
I don't - I don't know how to stop it.
it's not my bomb.
whose is it?
is it Jackson's?
is he pulling the strings?
I shouldn't even be talking to you.
he'll kill her if I tell you guys anything.
kill who?
look, you might as well tell me.
it's just us on the phone, all right?
I mean...you're already in a very bad spot. You do know that, don't you?
they have someone in my house with my wife.
they're going to kill her if I don't go through with this.
I don't know what else to do.
he's telling the truth.
the washington metropolitan police department...
Hey, it's us. Are you at the clubhouse?
Yeah, I'm working here.
Where's agent Irving?
um, he's doing the search of the bar.
Maria, give very simple answers...and don't let anyone think...
what you're saying is important.
OK.
is there a man there named Dave Miller?
he would've been there all day.
Yeah.
all right, I'm going to call Irving and tell him to get in there.
this man is probably armed and he's willing to kill.
Wow. I did not know that.
he's there as a threat against the wife to force harold to go through with this.
that would certainly explain... - The fear you saw earlier.
OK, well, that sounds fun.
hopefully, I can get tickets.
Reynolds has been on with agent Irving. He's on his way. Just sit tight, all right?
cool. Let me know how it goes.
shouldn't be more than a few minutes. We'll get out of here.
what were they saying about Harold?
find out what kind of bomb it is?
no, no.
but I do have some bad news.
I don't think they're going to let Harold talk to the president.
probably not.
but I think I have a solution...
to this whole thing and you two know him well, obviously, so let me just run it by you.
I have a friend who works in assemblyman kincaid's office.
maybe I call in a favor and he can talk to Harold.
that's, uh - that's not really the same thing.
but at least it's a phone call...
with someone who works in the government.
lady, quit wasting our time.
that's kind of the point, actually.
put your hands over your head.
people lie all the time. It must make you pretty cynical.
sometimes, but you get to see the truth occasionally.
truth is, I'm really scared right now.
I know.
me, too.
well, a little bit.
I just...I want another chance, you know?
I'd do things different.
is that a stupid thing to say?
no, not at all.
Oscar's acting weird.
Oscar, you ok?
you know, when I was your age,
I had a crush on this girl - older woman, really - Sixth grader.
I was always worrying about it, stressing out about it,
and then I realized there was nothing you can do.
so, sometimes, when there's nothing you can do,
you just have to believe everything is gonna be ok.
and you write a song.
can't be worried and write a song at the same time, right?
I mean, you look to me like a guy who can write some fantastic rhymes.
am I right?
Yep, I can tell that about you.
I can see it on your face.
so, let's give it a shot.
your wife and your son are safe, Harold.
thank you.
tell me about jackson.
I don't know. He just put me in this tractor and he told me to drive here.
he said if I got out of the seat, it would trigger the bomb.
and he didn't mention any other plan to you.
no, nothing. I mean, I knew that he was even angrier than I was.
but I never thought in a million years he would...
I'm a dead man.
can I speak to my wife?
Yeah, yeah, I'll work on that for you.
sit tight, Harold, all right? I'll get back to you.
you have to call off the disrupter charge until we can figure out what's going on.
Harold is just a pawn.
the ira used to do the same thing. They'd coerce civilians to do the work for 'em.
there's nothing we can do for him now.
he's still sitting on a bomb we can't defuse.
Hey, look, if he moves, call me back.
jackson just turned his phone on.
we triangulated it to 15th and I street.
Hey, that is right here,
just outside the blast radius.
that's also near the hotel...
where secretary Dobbins is holding his economic summit.
OK, Jackson's credit card was used to rent a white box van 4 hours ago.
all right, I'm headed over there now. Remind me what this guy looks like?
let's get that out to all units.
Yeah, but he's not gonna look like that, is he?
I mean, he's probably gonna be disguised or something.
you need to look for the posture...
and the gaze of a terrorist.
why am I telling you this?
why don't you just come with me?
take a look at that - white box van, no plates.
suspension's maxed out.
Yeah.
so the terrorists have their own delivery vehicle.
this takes me back.
he's probably gonna want to hide in plain sight.
could be in that crowd over there.
Yeah, so he can keep an eye on his van.
Yeah, on the target.
you know how it is.
what happens if we spot him?
that's the signal. - All right.
Yeah, give me the bomb squad.
Hey, Jackson.
we've got Harold's wife and son. They're safe.
you got the wrong guy, pal.
no, no. You're ron Jackson, right?
you've got a bomb in that van back there, don't ya?
answer me.
what about Harold's trailer? Is that just a decoy? Eh?
answer me!
I know that's the trigger.
Jackson, put the phone down!
put it down!
all right, so you're all officially songwriters now.
nice work, and I want to thank oscar for these great lyrics.
my pleasure.
all right, here we go.
and, um, sing your part.
help me out, all right? Good.
here you go.
good work.
command post.
sir, we've got Jackson and the bomb. It's over.
things are about to get wrapped up here, too.
did you get Howard out of the tractor yet?
I can't risk the lives of my bomb techs on this.
there's no telling how many booby traps...
there are in harold's device.
look, Ben, you did a great job, ok?
but we're proceeding. I'm sorry.
if there are other conspirators out there,
they find out jackson's dead, they'll push the button on harold's bomb.
Hey, when I asked jackson about harold's bomb, right,
he was defensive. He was bluffing.
can you tell me with 100% certainty...
that there's no bomb on Harold Clark's trailer?
not yet. Give me time.
we're out of time.
Hello?
Harold, we've got Jackson and Miller,
and we took care of Jackson's bomb.
how's my family?
they're doing fine.
thank you for saving them.
I can't take credit for that, but I'll pass on your thanks.
the fbi still thinks you have a bomb in your trailer,
and they want to disrupt you with an explosive device...
that could kill you in the process. Uh...
I understand.
Harold, did you ever see the bomb? Or were you just told about a dead man switch?
I heard the click of the switch. I never saw the bomb.
Ron said that he would call and tell me how to diffuse it if I just stalled you guys long enough.
that's not good enough. - Yeah, no, I get it.
look, they should go ahead and do it, just to be sure.
there are too many people around here, and if there is a bomb in my trailer...
I'd rather die than live knowing I may have killed other people.
Yeah, we're not there yet.
please, just let me talk to my wife before they do it, though.
please! So I can just say good-bye?
honey, I hope you can forgive me.
what are you talking about?
I love you.
I have always loved you.
and I want you to...
I want you to give Bobby a big hug for me.
I want you to tell him that I am sorry.
I've always been very proud to have you as a husband, Harold.
let's do it.
you know, you should leave if you don't want to see this.
it's about bloody time, Torres.
I got it. It should be ready to pull up.
all right.
And?
I think you're right.
is there a bomb in harold's trailer?
Yes, there is.
why should I believe you?
Ron wanted to kill the secretary of treasury and all those money men when they evacuated.
even if that didn't work, He was going to have harold's bomb blow just to get the message across.
so, yeah, Harold's got a bomb, all right.
I mean, you see that, right?
I see it.
right, he's lying through his teeth.
I mean, their only hope of collateral damage...
is if the FBI blows Harold up for 'em.
I mean, you're the puppet now.
no. I can't take that chance.
well, I bloody can. I'm going to see harold.
boss, I'm going to have to go with Lightman on this one.
I said no. I can't allow it.
look, you asked me to make the call, right?
well, now, I'm making it.
there is no bomb in that trailer.
if you're wrong, it's your ass.
well, if I'm wrong, in 5 minutes, I won't have an ass, will I?
are you telling me you're 100% sure?
Yes.
but...I'd clear the area, you know?
just in case I'm wrong.
Hey, Harold.
Hey, how ya doin'?
I'm Cal Lightman. We spoke on the phone earlier.
you're safe now. You can come on down.
are you out of your mind?
no, not right now, but, in a couple of hours,
I'm gonna be really very drunk.
well, what about the bomb?
there is no bomb. It's safe.
there's a bomb. I heard a click.
Harold, this is probably your one and only chance to walk away from this.
so, if I were you, I'd definitely step on down.
careful.
here, let me give you a hand.
you're all right.
there ya go.
all right.
don't go near that one because that one is a bomb.
what are you doing?
hang on a minute.
good work.
nice work.
no? Ok.
I'm the one who Stole Clyde.
Oh, I know.
he's a turtle and he doesn't like being in the classroom at night all by himself.
I took him home so he wouldn't be lonely.
OK.
you know, I think that Clyde probably like being on his own at night. I think he enjoys the quiet.
I say you bring him back into school tomorrow, all right?
to the classroom. But you sneak him back in.
no one needs to know a thing.
I think I should tell Miss Angela.
Really?
Oh, good girl.
I might have a job for you one day.
all yours.
get out of here. Don't miss your bus.
go on, you guys. I'll be right there.
well, there's a first time for everything.
you all right?
um, anyone want a drink?
the following story is fictional and does not depict any actual person or event.
my name is Harold Clark. I want to talk to the president.
lying lands you right here.
smack dab in front of me.
when it comes to lying, I'm your man.
that makes Dr. Lightman very special.
so, since you dragged me away from my work,
who can tell me what a lie is?
when my mom tells my dad he's not getting a big belly?
Yeah. Right. We learn to lie from grown-ups.
they think you don't notice, but you do.
most of the time lying is bad, right?
even if you think you're doing it for a good reason.
trust me, life's a lot easier if you learn to tell the truth.
Lightman is miserable.
what strings did you pull to get him to do this?
I had Emily ask.
she tutors a couple of the kids.
thought I could turn our class problem into a teachable moment.
that'd be a help.
so, even if you're just thinking of not telling me the truth,
I'll warn you. It's pretty hard to keep a lie from me.
go on. Go on, I dare you.
eh? Right. Clyde the turtle.
which one of you stole Clyde the turtle from Miss Angela's classroom? Eh?
no takers?
all of you are innocent, are you?
we need to talk.
all right. Good. Boys and girls,
meet FBI agent Benjamin Reynolds.
Oh, hey, kids, how ya doing?
Hi. Hey, agent Ben.
we need to talk. Foster's waiting.
you, too. Come on.
all right.
Oh, and by the way,
whoever it is that stole Clyde the turtle,
the turtle's - they're like lettuce,
or is that tortoises?
I'm gonna work on that one.
take a look at this screen.
this guy parked right in front of the treasury department annex.
that's like two blocks from here.
Yeah.
how long's he been there?
little under 15 minutes.
anybody consider this might be a peaceful protest?
a crazy farmer named Harold Clark...
is driving up to Washington D. C
to blow you federal folks up.
he's got his tractor and trailer packed
with enough explosives to blow up the whole town.
so not a peaceful protest then?
Yeah. Who's the caller?
we don't know yet.
the call was relayed here,
but the subscriber information didn't convey.
we're waiting to retrieve it now.
is there anything else to support
the fact that he actually has a bomb in there?
that's what we need you all for.
so the question at hand is,
is the threat real or is it a hoax?
we need to get these kids out of here now.
no. We're not doing that.
protocol is anyone within the bomb radius...
stays inside and away from exterior windows.
in situations like these more people are killed
by flying glass than the blast itself.
Plus, this guy, he may be waiting for people
to evacuate just so he can trigger it.
so, everyone - including those kids
is staying right here until we can figure this thing out.
I was hoping you were going to say that.
all right. I've got us tapped into the bureau's cameras.
all right. Tight as you can.
tighter.
all right. Come on, come on.
so, what do we know about this man?
it's like the caller said, the guy's name is Harold Clark.
he has--well, he had a family farm...
right outside Fredericksburg, Virginia.
but it's now in foreclosure.
he definitely seems agitated.
no, he's anxious.
Yeah, which I might be if the president didn't take my call.
Oh, come on. You know that's not gonna happen.
no, what I'm saying is I'm not seeing mad bomber anxiety here.
do you have any of your agents going on to this guy's farm?
Yeah, from the Richmond office.
Where's Torres?
do you think she's ready to handle this on her own?
no, but we seem to be under lockdown here,
so I'm willing to lower the bar. Where is she?
helping set up her cousin's quinceanera.
Ah. Well, hold the cake.
let's send her down to the farmhouse.
let's see what his family thinks of this little field trip.
what about the kids?
I'm all over it.
OK, you guys, let's go. Quietly.
wait. come here, you.
hand it over.
Yeah. Nice try, son.
that's how I got it.
we need you all in the conference room, ok?
Why?
because it's awesome.
come on.
go after him. Go on.
let's go.
is something wrong?
we have a bit of a situation.
we just need you all away from...any windows.
Hey, 8 third-graders
in a room with no toys and no puppies?
it's going to be chaos.
Yeah. Speaking of puppies,
you like kids, don't you?
no.
OK.
boys and girls, this is crazy uncle Loker.
he's going to be continuing our education on lying.
for how long?
as long as it takes.
Hey.
Torres is en route.
Oh. This is my boss, Asac Steele.
Dr. Cal Lightman.
yo. Steele. Thanks for letting us set up here.
all right, my office,
my science you're obviously after.
it's under my command. Ok?
where are we doing this?
I have some information you need to hear.
all right.
optical chemical sensors are picking up traces
of ammonium nitrates and diesel fuel from the trailer.
aren't those pretty standard farmyard smells?
Yes, but he could also have an anfo bomb big enough
to take out several blocks of downtown D. C.
right.
collateral damage-wise, there's a pretty strong case here for death by sniper, wouldn't you say?
I mean, you only need to be 30% sure he's got a bomb,
then just kill him, taking one human life
by saving thousands of others...
including those kids in there.
you're the expert. That's the call you're going to have to make.
what? Do I look like an FBI puppet to you?
your offices, your command, you're the one who said that.
Yeah, I did say that.
all right. No, thanks.
come on, look, look, look.
my boss is a really good guy, ok?
but he's not equipped to figure this thing out the you are.
so, come on, man. We need to know.
does that guy have a bomb in a trailer or not?
all right.
all right. Well, if I'm going to do this,
I'll need to deal with him personally,
so can you put me through?
no No No. We have our own negotiators.
bombers have a messiah complex so...
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Avoid discussion of the bomber's present crisis in order to prevent him from exercising his god-like power to destroy and kill...
Yeah. I wrote that bit in the manual.
is that true?
well, when you're ready...
all right.
hello.
Harold, I'm Cal Lightman.
do you have the president with you?
no, no, not right now,
but I'm calling at his request.
call me back when you got him.
what do I know?
yes? Mary Clark?
who are you?
may we come inside, ma'am?
my friends are here.
Oh, this won't take long.
we are live outside the treasury department annex
in northwest Washington D. C.
where a disgruntled...
has Harold ever talked about taking action against the government?
Mrs. Clark?
he complained, you know, like everyone else about taxes and the economy.
I just, uh...I can't believe he's up there in damn D. C.
with his tractor.
so you did not know that he was going to go do this today?
no. No.
he talked about, um...
maybe going up there with a megaphone.
and, uh, calling out them bastards
in the treasury department, but not this.
it sounds like Harold's pretty angry.
you're damn right he's pissed.
they took his family farm.
three generations, they had it.
ma'am, it's not a huge leap from anger to violence.
does he have a bomb in that trailer he towed?
you listen to me - harold and I have been together since sophomore year in high school.
I know this man.
he would never hurt anyone.
you didn't answer the question, ma'am.
no, he doesn't have a damn bomb.
he just...
he just wants to talk to the president.
you don't believe that.
otherwise, you wouldn't have fear all over your face.
I'm not afraid of what he's going to do.
I'm afraid of what you all are going to do to him.
so, unless you have a search warrant to be here,
I'd really like it if you'd leave my home.
I can get a warrant in 10 minutes.
then get it.
reading emotions helps us discover lies.
who wants to tell me what emotion this person is feeling?
this one and that one.
contempt.
I don't think they know what that is.
is this really science? It seems dumb.
we were supposed to leave half an hour ago.
why are we still here?
now's when we have music class.
Yeah.
isn't this better than music class?
no.
Dr. Cal!
they want to know why they're here instead of back in music class,
which is where they normally are at this time.
it's my fault.
I told your bus driver to go and pick up a couple of friends of mine at the airport.
and the plane was late, so he's stuck there,
waiting for them. Sorry about that.
are you allowed to do that?
Yeah, I got permission from your principal.
you know, someone in here is definitely lying
about Clyde the turtle. I can smell it.
Loker, get your guitar, entertain the troops.
Oh, it's Torres. Hey.
I spoke to Harold's wife.
she's definitely hiding something.
did you ask her about the bomb?
Yeah, but she doesn't believe he has one.
who ever heard of a husband keeping secrets from his wife?
the only thing I know for sure is she doesn't believe he's violent.
Hello?
Harold, I've got a question for you.
call me when you're ready to let me speak with the president.
Yeah, well, he wants to know what you want to talk about.
is it global warming? Death penalty? What?
I want to talk about our tax money being sent overseas,
or bailing out banks,
but letting our farmers choke on their own crops.
somebody's got to stand up and say something.
all right. Well, I'll pass that on.
in the meantime, could you answer a question for me?
Yeah, what is it?
all right.
what kind of bomb are we talking about?
what?
well, there's a rumor going on around here that you're sitting on a bomb.
is this you trying to change the subject?
no, no, we spoke to your wife. She was a little off.
I want the president.
let me replay that.
what?
when you asked him if he had a bomb,
the left side of his lip tightened.
it's contempt.
he's being deceptive.
so you're giving us the green light.
what is it with you people?
why is it always red light, green light?
what do you want me to do?
pull the trigger for you?
wait, wait, let me explain something to you.
I'm trying to save innocent lives here, your included.
all right? There are no easy choices here.
so let's all act like grown-ups,
make the hard choices, and salvage what we can.
right.
well, what I'm telling you is that he's being
deceptive in his denial of having a bomb.
I don't know yet what that means exactly.
it's good enough for me.
do it and I'll prep the snipers.
all right. So once you're in place,
concealed, and on target, sound off.
let's follow all protocols on this.
no happy triggers.
Roger that, sir.
do you guys have to do this in the lobby?
we've got a bunch of kids here we've managed to keep in the dark so far.
until I give the word,
you are not authorized to shoot...
unless someone's in immediate danger. You got that?
we'll be waiting for your green light.
then get going.
Yes, sir!
a little mood lighting?
Yeah, the ballasts on the fluorescent lights
interferes with our video and encrypted radio communications.
all right, we're good to go.
now you've got some semblance of a rapport with Harold.
keep him distracted while the snipers move in, ok?
Oh, that's nice.
remind me to renegotiate my contract with you.
we appreciate what you're doing, Doctor.
Yes, I know you do.
Hello?
Harold. Me again.
I spoke with the president's office.
when can I talk to him?
well, you need to promise me
that no one's going to get hurt here.
I don't want anybody to get hurt.
that was genuine.
so I'll work with that or I'm done here, all right?
I believe you when you say that,
but I don't think that you're telling me the whole truth about the bomb.
quit stalling.
did you tell the president what I wanted to talk about?
Yeah, I did. I told him.
but he wants to know what it is that you want him to do.
I'll tell him on the phone.
is your wife involved in this?
no, no, this is all me.
quit playing games.
right.
OK. Seats 4, we're going to have a concert.
OK.
Hey.
how dangerous is it out there?
how dangerous is it in here?
I don't know.
but I trust Lightman,
and it's my job to keep these kids from freaking out.
what if their teacher is freaked out?
well, I'll help her, too...
but you've got to help me with them first, ok?
OK.
OK.
who knows the words to "puff, the magic dragon"?
my mom said that song's about illegal drugs.
I don't think that's ever been definitively proven.
all sniper teams in position.
all right. Copy that.
you can go ahead and try and engage him.
we're ready.
you have the president?
all right, Harold, a little reality check here.
your situation is veering from bad to worse by the minute.
I'm getting cold, and I'm getting angry.
I don't want to talk to you anymore.
well, that's unfortunate,
because I'm the only person here
who has any desire to talk to you.
I just want to talk to the president.
well, let's start with the truth then.
what kind of bomb are we talking about here?
the bomb is rigged.
how?
it just is, ok?
if you do anything to me,
you try to hurt me, the bomb goes off.
and if I don't speak directly to the president before the sun goes down,
the bomb goes off!
look, man, all that can be avoided...
if you just have the president call me.
is he telling the truth?
Yeah.
Yeah, I believe he is.
but he's also showing fear.
all right, it's the kind of fear that you get when someone's got a gun to your head.
believe me, I've seen that.
you know what, zoom into that tractor seat.
go ahead.
Yeah. Lower.
lower. Right, keep going...
right ther...
Oh, god.
we didn't see it before because his jacket was in the way.
sniper one to base.
all sniper teams in position. We're waiting for green light.
just hold your position, sniper team.
you are not cleared to fire. Stand down.
sniper one is clear.
standing down.
if this guy has a detonator switch on his seat...
and if we fire, that might detonate the bomb.
let's use an lvb water disrupter.
is that what I think it is?
it's a bomb we bring in to kill his bomb.
Oh, this is just getting better and better, this is.
I found something on the 911 call you should hear.
a crazy farmer named Harold Clark is driving up to Washington D. C.
to blow you federal folks up.
one more time.
a crazy farmer named Harold Clark is driving up to Washington D. C.
to blow you federal folks up.
all right, just that last little bit.
blow you federal folks up.
do you hear it?
Yeah, he's smiling.
what?
the inflection of his voice changes...
because a smile changes the sound of your voice
by shortening the voice resonance chamber.
he's smiling as he says "blow you federal folks up."
wait, you can tell someone's smiling just by listening to him?
you can't. We can.
he know something you don't and he's laughing at you.
so what is this, a practical joke?
no, I think he's telling the truth.
he finds some kind of sick humor in this.
he may be connected to this.
Yeah.
Harold is not working on his own.
we need to find this guy quick.
no, I get it, I do.
you're looking for someone to blame in case this thing goes south, right?
that's why you set up your command center in my office, effectively putting my finger on the trigger.
well, what do you say we make sure before you just go ahead and kill him?
are you done?
because constitutionally speaking,
you don't have to be right to use deadly force,
we just have to be reasonably sure.
and in a world full of bombs and lunatics...
sometimes there's no room for scientific certainty.
you know, you're so scared of making a huge mistake,
you're prepared to make a smaller,
yet potentially still tragic one.
you want this to end peacefully?
you give me proof and allow me to do that.
all right. The 911 caller was just id'd as Ron Jackson.
white male, 38, lives near harold in virginia.
boss, we've got time.
we should get Torres and one of your agents over there right now.
Yeah.
in this situation stalling and not making a decision
is the same thing as making one.
well, I want to be certain of the truth when I make my decision.
well, you better make it soon...
because the clock is ticking on that bomb.
bomb? What bomb?
he had to go to the bathroom.
you're a big kid, right?
you're not going to turn into one of them...
whiny little cry babies, are you?
right. No?
all right.
here's the truth.
all right?
not far from here there's a man who says he's got a bomb.
he's trying to get some people's attention.
now, maybe he has and maybe he's lying.
but, in the meantime, you and your mates,
you're going to stay here, just to be on the safe side.
you got it? All right.
now, it's my job to find out what's what with this maybe-maybe not bomb type thing,
and I'm excellent at my job.
just ask Loker here.
and it's your job to be a top-notch third-grader.
you up for it?
you up for keeping this a secret from your mates...
so that they don't get all, you know, scaredy cat on you?
good. All right.
well, go pee then.
excuse me.
what ctan I do for you?
I'm looking for Ron Jackson.
is he your husband?
don't remind me.
wait, ma'am.
FBI.
where is he, ma'am?
we need to talk to him.
sorry, I thought y'all were bill collectors.
Where's your husband, ma'am?
honestly, I got no idea.
what's he done now?
you know a man named Harold Clark?
Yeah.
I guess everyone knows Harold now.
how do you know him?
him and Ron run a farmers' co-op.
they mostly get together, drink, and bitch about things.
all right we take a look around, ma'am?
Yeah, we ain't got nothin' to hide.
blasting caps for bombs.
all right, look, just hear me out, ok?
maybe jackson was an accomplice,
but he got cold feet, decided to call 911,
and give up the whole plot.
that doesn't explain the smile behind his voice.
what is that?
Oh, that.
that's how these boys plan to win this.
it doesn't look like much, but...
here's the deal, ok?
we're going to place that container of water near harold's bomb.
there's a large quantity of c-4
in the middle of the container,
which we will then detonate,
sending the water out at 72 million psi.
it will disrupt harold's bomb before it can explode.
and Harold's birdfeed.
he won't even know what hit him.
Oh, this is going to be fun.
what the hell is that thing coming towards me?
it's an x-ray machine, Harold.
we needed to map the bomb...
so we can figure out a safe evacuation plan.
tell me about ron Jackson.
you know about Ron?
Yep.
better still, why don't you tell me...
how to disable the bomb so nobody gets hurt.
I don't - I don't know how to stop it.
it's not my bomb.
whose is it?
is it Jackson's?
is he pulling the strings?
I shouldn't even be talking to you.
he'll kill her if I tell you guys anything.
kill who?
look, you might as well tell me.
it's just us on the phone, all right?
I mean...You're already in a very bad spot.
you do know that, don't you?
they have someone in my house with my wife.
they're going to kill her if I don't go through with this.
I don't know what else to do.
he's telling the truth.
the washington metropolitan police department...
Torres.
Hey, it's us. Are you at the clubhouse?
Yeah, I'm working here.
Where's agent irving?
um, he's doing the search of the bar.
Maria, give very simple answers...
and don't let anyone think...
what you're saying is important.
OK.
is there a man there named dave miller?
he would've been there all day.
Yeah.
all right, I'm going to call irving and tell him to get in there.
this man is probably armed and he's willing to kill.
Wow. I did not know that.
he's there as a threat against the wife
to force harold to go through with this.
that would certainly explain
the fear you saw earlier.
OK, well, that sounds fun.
hopefully, I can get tickets.
Reynolds has been on with agent Irving.
he's on his way. Just sit tight, all right?
cool. Let me know how it goes.
shouldn't be more than a few minutes.
we'll get out of here.
what were they saying about Harold?
find out what kind of bomb it is?
no, no.
but I do have some bad news.
I don't think they're going to let Harold talk to the president.
probably not.
but I think I have a solution
to this whole thing and you two know him well,
obviously, so let me just run it by you.
I have a friend who works in assemblyman kincaid's office.
maybe I call in a favor and he can talk to Harold.
that's, uh - that's not really the same thing.
but at least it's a phone call with someone who works in the government.
lady, quit wasting our time.
that's kind of the point, actually.
put your hands over your head.
people lie all the time.
it must make you pretty cynical.
sometimes, but you get to see the truth occasionally.
truth is, I'm really scared right now.
I know.
me, too.
well, a little bit.
I just...I want another chance, you know?
I'd do things different.
is that a stupid thing to say?
no, not at all.
Oscar's acting weird.
Oscar, you ok?
Hey.
you know, when I was your age,
I had a crush on this girl--older woman, really
sixth grader.
I was always worrying about it, stressing out about it,
and then I realized there was nothing you can do.
so, sometimes, when there's nothing you can do,
you just have to believe everything is gonna be ok.
and you write a song.
can't be worried and write a song at the same time, right?
I mean, you look to me like a guy who can write some fantastic rhymes.
am I right?
Yep, I can tell that about you.
I can see it on your face.
so, let's give it a shot.
your wife and your son are safe, Harold.
thank you.
tell me about Jackson.
I don't know.
he just put me in this tractor and he told me to drive here.
he said if I got out of the seat, it would trigger the bomb.
and he didn't mention any other plan to you.
no, nothing.
I mean, I knew that he was even angrier than I was.
but I never thought in a million years he would...
I'm a dead man.
can I speak to my wife?
Yeah, yeah, I'll work on that for you.
sit tight, harold, all right?
I'll get back to you.
you have to call off the disrupter charge
until we can figure out what's going on.
Harold is just a pawn.
the ira used to do the same thing.
they'd coerce civilians to do the work for 'em.
there's nothing we can do for him now.
he's still sitting on a bomb we can't defuse.
Hey, look, if he moves, call me back.
jackson just turned his phone on.
we triangulated it to 15th and I street.
Hey, that is right here,
just outside the blast radius.
that's also near the hotel
where secretary dobbins is holding his economic summit.
OK, Jackson's credit card was used to rent a white box van 4 hours ago.
all right, I'm headed over there now.
remind me what this guy looks like?
let's get that out to all units.
Yeah, but he's not gonna look like that, is he?
I mean, he's probably gonna be disguised or something.
you need to look for the posture，
and the gaze of a terrorist.
why am I telling you this?
why don't you just come with me?
take a look at that - white box van, no plates.
suspension's maxed out.
Yeah.
so the terrorists have their own delivery vehicle.
this takes me back.
he's probably gonna want to hide in plain sight
could be in that crowd over there.
Yeah, so he can keep an eye on his van.
Yeah, on the target.
you know how it is.
what happens if we spot him?
that's the signal.
all right.
Yeah, give me the bomb squad.
Hey, Jackson.
we've got harold's wife and son.
they're safe.
you got the wrong guy, pal.
no, no. You're Ron Jackson, right?
you've got a bomb in that van back there, don't ya?
answer me.
what about harold's trailer?
is that just a decoy?
answer me!
I know that's the trigger.
Jackson, put the phone down!
put it down!
FBI! Fbi. Fbi.
all right, so you're all officially song writers now.
nice work, and I want to thank oscar for these great lyrics.
my pleasure.
all right, here we go.
and, um, sing your part.
help me out, all right?
good.
here you go.
good work.
command post.
sir, we've got jackson and the bomb.
it's over.
things are about to get wrapped up here, too.
did you get howard out of the tractor yet?
I can't risk the lives of my bomb techs on this.
there's no telling how many booby traps there are in Harold's device.
boss, listen
look, ben, you did a great job, ok?
but we're proceeding. I'm sorry.
if there are other conspirators out there,
they find out Jackson's dead,
they'll push the button on Harold's bomb.
Hey, when I asked jackson about harold's bomb,
he was defensive. He was bluffing.
can you tell me with 100% certainty...
that there's no bomb on harold clark's trailer?
not yet. Give me time.
we're out of time.
Hello?
Harold, we've got Jackson and Miller,
and we took care of jackson's bomb.
how's my family?
they're doing fine.
thank you for saving them.
I can't take credit for that, but I'll pass on your thanks.
the fbi still thinks you have a bomb in your trailer,
and they want to disrupt you with an explosive device
that could kill you in the process. Uh...
I understand.
Harold, did you ever see the bomb?
or were you just told about a dead man switch?
I heard the click of the switch.
I never saw the bomb.
Ron said that he would call and tell me how
to diffuse it if I just stalled you guys long enough.
that's not good enough.
Yeah, no, I get it.
look, they should go ahead and do it, just to be sure.
there are too many people around here, and if there...
is a bomb in my trailer...
I'd rather die than live knowing I may have killed other people.
Yeah, we're not there yet.
please, just let me talk to my wife before they do it, though.
please? So I can just say good-bye?
honey, I hope you can forgive me.
what are you talking about?
I love you.
I have always loved you.
and I want you to...
I want you to give bobby a big hug for me.
I want you to tell him that I am sorry.
I've always been very proud to have you as a husband, Harold.
let's do it.
you know, you should leave if you don't want to see this.
it's about bloody time, Torres.
I got it. It should be ready to pull up.
all right.
And?
I think you're right.
is there a bomb in harold's trailer?
Yes, there is.
why should I believe you?
Ron wanted to kill the secretary of treasury...
and all those money men when they evacuated.
even if that didn't work,
he was going to have Harold's bomb blow just to get the message across.
so, yeah, Harold's got a bomb, all right.
I mean, you see that, right?
I see it.
right, he's lying through his teeth.
I mean, their only hope of collateral damage
is if the FBI blows harold up for 'em.
I mean, you're the puppet now.
no. I can't take that chance.
well, I bloody can. I'm going to see Harold.
boss, I'm going to have to go with Lightman on this one.
I said no. I can't allow it.
look, you asked me to make the call, right?
well, now, I'm making it.
there is no bomb in that trailer.
if you're wrong, it's your ass.
well, if I'm wrong, in 5 minutes, I won't have an ass, will I?
are you telling me you're 100% sure?
Yes.
but...I'd clear the area, you know?
just in case I'm wrong.
Hey, Harold.
Hey, how ya doin'?
I'm Cal Lightman. We spoke on the phone earlier.
you're safe now. You can come on down.
are you out of your mind?
no, not right now, but, in a couple of hours,
I'm gonna be really very drunk.
well, what about the bomb?
there is no bomb. It's safe.
there's a bomb. I heard a click.
Harold, this is probably your one and only chance to walk away from this.
so, if I were you, I'd definitely step on down.
careful.
here, let me give you a hand.
you're all right.
there ya go.
all right.
don't go near that one because that one is a bomb.
what are you doing?
hang on a minute.
good work.
nice work.
no? Ok.
I'm the one who stole Clyde.
Oh, I know.
he's a turtle and he doesn't like being in the classroom at night all by himself.
I took him home so he wouldn't be lonely.
OK.
you know, I think that Clyde probably likes being on his own at night.
I think he enjoys the quiet.
I say you bring him back into school tomorrow, all right?
to the classroom.
but you sneak him back in.
no one needs to know a thing.
I think I should tell Miss Angela.
Really?
Oh, good girl.
I might have a job for you one day.
all yours.
get out of here. Don't miss your bus.
go on, you guys. I'll be right there.
I hope you guy had fun - bye. - bye.
well, there's a first time for everything.
you all right?
um, anyone want a drink? Hmm?
absolutely - yes, please.
this must feel like slumming to you, speaking at my lowly graduate seminar.
well, someone's got to set your students straight about my work.
just pointing out the flaws.
and you're doing a fine job.
have you two always been like this?
no, we're far more civil now.
I'd like to have seen Lightman at Oxford.
Yes. Back when he was a real student of psychology.
are you sure you want me sabotaging your students?
no, but I don't have another lecture ready, so you're on.
fine.
because people have got to know whether or not their president's a crook.
well, I'm not a crook.
I've earned everything I've got.
I love this guy.
you see how he's looking down and he's nodding?
he's contradicting his own statement.
he hesitates before saying he's earned everything he's got.
and notice the crossed arms.
he's defensive.
which means he's full of it.
he's not nodding his head. He's looking down at his notes.
being defensive doesn't mean you're lying.
well, one of these things by itself may not be conclusive, but when you put them together, they add up to deception.
Yeah, or you're looking for things to prove deception so you find them.
and if Lincoln were showing in the same behaviors, would you say he was lying?
I'd say he was Nixon in a Lincoln mask.
all right, let's do a practical demonstration and then you guys can see for yourself.
we need a volunteer.
how about you? Mister, um...
right.
so, I've got 10 pictures.
pick one, then lie about what you're seeing r tell the truth, and Dr. Lightman will read you.
what about stakes?
I read your book, Dr. Lightman.
without stakes, it's hard to spot a lie.
there's no fear of being caught.
all right.
100 bucks says I can read you like a book.
all right.
a pretty girl.
college age, I'd say.
ponytail. Blonde.
big eyes.
and pale, pink blouse.
you like the ladies, Martin?
Yeah. What's not to like?
in that case, you're talking out your ass, 'cause whatever you're seeing there you don't like it.
what do you say now, Dr. Lightman?
double or quits.
guy tied to a chair.
he's soaking wet.
being zapped with electric cables, like you'd use to jump start a car.
total rubbish.
OK. I think that's it for today's class.
our thanks to Dr. Lightman.
always entertaining and fascinating.
we'll have to do this again.
a bad day for Lightman way.
Hey. Where are you going?
did you put him up to this?
how could I do that?
I mean, your technique is foolproof, right?
Yeah.
here's the problem.
martin Walker's a psychopath, probably a killer.
just thought you should know.
right. In a healthy kid, you would expect to get arousal and revulsion.
what we got in Martin was revulsion and arousal.
revulsion can appear to be arousal.
markers are similar.
it says so right in your book, Cal.
those pictures aren't proof of anything, Dr. Lightman.
no, look. We saw the same indicators in Ted Bundy.
Oh, Bundy?
Yeah, he was a good-looking fella, killed about 60 women, give or take.
Dr. Lightman is prone to the dramatic.
aren't we all?
Oh, please! Martin exposed your science to be flawed.
so what, therefore he has to be punished?
Dr. Foster, do you concur with your colleague?
I didn't see what he saw, but reading facial cues isn't my specialty.
well, it is mine, and I suggest you bring him in for psych evaluation.
without something more substantial,
I can't justify that kind of action.
all right. If the university isn't looking into at least one missing persons case, I'll eat my shoes.
Oh, yeah. I think I'm on to something here.
a sophomore girl went missing a month ago.
the police have no evidence of foul play.
it's an open case, and they don't have any leads.
except the one I'm giving you.
I'll ask the police to talk to him, but quietly.
in other words, you'll do sod all.
just say it.
I haven't got a clue what you're on about.
OK, fine. I'll say it for you.
you're mad I didn't back you up.
but Cal, I didn't see what you saw.
beating you a couple of times doesn't make him a psychopath.
once. He only beat me once.
second time, I let him win because I wanted to see how much he got off on the humiliating me.
all right, there's a lot of people out there might enjoy doing that, but they all know me. He doesn't.
so yeah, I'm going to need his medical files and any psychological profile that might exist.
you know that those are confidential.
Yeah. Yeah.
no time for ethics on this one.
Cal, you're crossing that line.
Helen's already crossed it.
one should not shag one's students, especially not the psychopathic ones.
I never said I saw aliens.
I saw an unidentified flying object.
now, what is so loony about that?
well, school board is gonna say there's a lot loony about it.
I'm not crazy, Miss Torres.
frankly, corroborating your story is gonna be a little difficult.
what did it look like?
the overall Gestalt of the thing was, uh...
was like a hockey puck or a jelly doughnut.
were you drinking or taking any medication?
I was as dry as the Sahara.
would you describe what you saw as extraterrestrial?
look, when the Greeks saw lightning in the sky, they attributed it to Zeus, all right?
and when the Aborigines witnessed Halley's Comet, they thought it was a mighty shaman.
that's the trap that always ensnares us.
we need to explain.
well, this UFO claim seems like it's part of a pattern.
last %%%
that %%%
of the gentlemens' lounge.
it was a strip club, but it had the best view.
we're not here to assess his lesson planning, Ria.
when I saw the UFO, I called the local news.
I called the airport. I called Maddox Air Force Base.
I got stonewalled.
then somehow word got out that I'm proselytizing about little green men in the classroom, which I'm not.
Oh, you're adding conspiracy theory to your close encounter?
can you give us a sec?
sure.
I'm seeing how he reacts to an attack.
is he showing any markers of deception?
you really want to take this case?
what, is the guy an eccentric? Yes. Of course. Big time.
and so am I. Have you seen this shirt?
but I think he's being railroaded.
could he have really been the only person to have seen something so...
extraordinary?
listen, I stood in front of the mirror,
I've asked myself "is this the face of a crackpot?
well, maybe it is.
but this crackpot is one hell of a science teacher.
I love my job and I don't want to lose it.
we're gonna do everything we can.
I thought you were only here to humor me.
Yeah, well, what do you want from me?
old habits die hard.
I'm writing down all the places that we followed him to and writing down every thing that he does in each spot.
well, you better make a note. He's trolling for a victim.
Cal, so's every guy in this spot.
he's 25, single.
he's out the door with that girl in 10 minutes.
any takers?
I'll give you a ride home in my car.
you should alert the local police about this one.
and tell 'em what?
there's a guy going on a hot date?
here we go.
well, he made us.
it's about bloody time and all.
you having fun playing Detective?
this is Ben Reynolds of the FBI.
is he gonna give me a parking ticket?
we can't have you hurting that girl, now can we, Martin?
she's safe enough.
now she is, yeah.
Hello, Martin.
you knew I was coming.
Yeah, that's what predators do.
they check out their territory.
you killed that missing girl, didn't you?
of course not.
I'm harmless.
now I know I'm right.
I must admit, you had me going there, just for a minute.
the police talked to me today about the missing girl, but you knew that.
what about that girl tonight?
and what were you gonna do to her?
Oh, I was just gonna give her a ride home, like a good Samaritan.
thanks to you, she had to walk.
I hope she made it OK.
so are you just gonna follow me the rest of my life?
I won't have to. You'll mess up.
you know what my dissertation was on?
how patience is adaptive.
hunters are at the top of the food chain, and they all take their time.
patience...
I find is overrated.
I noticed. You like to push to make things happen.
that's when people trip up.
most people.
you're gonna lose this game.
it's not a game, Martin.
sure, it is.
you love it just as much as I do.
I see it.
you're leaking joy.
I tell you what, you beat me, and I'll even give you back your 200 bucks.
good chess players think 5 moves ahead.
great chess players think one move ahead, but it's always the right move.
all right, I want these everywhere.
hallways, coffee shop, bookstore - any empty space, all right?
OK.
very subtle.
plan to stick around for the lawsuit?
no. It's just where I want the man.
in a courtroom.
Oh, really, Cal.
when did you become such a Fascist?
Pentagon, 2003, among other places.
it shows. We both know this is not about Martin.
this is about us.
"us" was 23 years ago.
I think I'm over it.
interesting how you remember the exact number of years.
Yes, bloody fascinating, isn't it?
you cannot quantify behavior, Cal, which is what you're trying to introduce to people.
no, look. I provide a tool.
all right, people misuse that tool, it's not my fault.
look at Martin, all right?
he is a loony.
all right, and if I'm right, you could be putting these women in danger.
and if you're wrong...
I'll recycle.
one thing about Cal is he's
insufferable.
no - well, yes, sometimes.
has he always been like this?
Yes, only more so.
a word?
he is not someone for the long haul.
Oh, no, no. We're not a...
just keep your distance, or you could find yourself a very lonely woman.
one time he brought in these kittens and said we should dissect them.
and this girl Lisa completely freaked and called the cops.
but he was just teaching us to question authority.
did Mr. Hickson ever say anything about aliens?
well, he said he saw somethin and asked us what it could have been.
and flying saucer made it on the list?
Yeah.
right underneath the magic brownies?
you didn't think that was funny, Andre?
cause that thing you did where you just looked down and away, that's regret.
ease up on the Jedi mind tricks, ok, everyone?
you don't know me.
well, maybe you are the person who told people that Mr. Hickson saw aliens.
look, all right, I didn't say nothin' and I ain't on trial.
Hey, Andre.
what's with the shame?
did you see the same thing Hickson saw?
I didn't see anything.
Hey, look. You can either sack up right now, or you can spend the rest of your l wondering if what you saw was real and if you could have saved Mr. Hickson's job.
it was real.
you like Mr. Hickson, so you photoshopped it.
look, he didn't forge it. That's exactly what I saw.
is the video real, yes or no?
Yes!
OK.
well, if this is what you saw, it must have been picked up on radar.
and not, then there's gotta be an explanation.
Yeah. Like the air force don't be lyin'.
we need to draw 'em out. We need get something we can read.
well, how are you gonna do that?
film at 11: 00.
martin should be home any minute now.
it is so wonderful you're considering him for the - what do you call it?
Lightman scholarship.
it's our department's most prestigious award.
every winner has to have a biographical profile.
right? So...
should we start with early childhood?
Oh, Martin was a very happy child, loved sports.
any head injuries?
trauma, like that?
what we mean is, did he have to overcome any difficulties as a child?
well, no, not really.
Oh! Martin.
the people are here from the Lightman scholarship.
no, mom. They're lying to you.
I don't - what?
he has a grudge, mom. He wants to destroy me. Look at this.
they're saying I hurt a girl.
this is - this is outrageous.
I want you out of my house.
well, don't you want to know if it's true?
Mrs. Walker, a girl is missing.
you can't believe Martin would ever hurt anyone.
Oh, she's not so sure.
me? I'd bet your house on it.
we should be moseying along, unless of course there's anything else you want to tell us.
I've nothing to say to you. I'm so sorry, Martin.
I really didn't know who they were.
no, it's OK, mom. I know it's not your fault.
it's OK, mom. They're going.
you saw her when I said he was guilty, right?
she crumbled.
she was taken by surprise, Cal.
surprise, my ass. She's scared to death of him.
she knows he's guilty, too.
Cal, maybe you are seeing what you want to see.
you buying his act, are you?
I think you and Helen have a lot of unresolved issues.
I think you two were a couple when you were her student, and I don't think you like your replacement.
you know, you're starting to sound a lot like Helen.
I mean that in the nicest possible way.
when I'm sure you're right about Martin,
I will back you 100%.
Oh, yeah.
here. Maybe this'll help convince you.
it was just laying about.
he has a sister?
apparently, yeah.
there's not a single picture of her in the house, though, not that I could see anyway.
what is this?
that is video of little Martin and presumably an older sister.
and where did you get it from?
borrowed it.
is that the background?
Yeah, and I didn't have to break any laws to get it. Here.
well, obviously, Martin had a sister.
her name is Marcy. She's 2 years older than him.
well, what happened to her?
she drowned in that pool when she was 7.
police report says that Martin witnessed the whole thing.
excuse me. Reynolds here.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
well, Mrs. Walker lied about Martin's happy childhood.
you seeing a pattern then?
Cal, he was 5.
2 1/2 times the terrible 2s.
what was the name of that hospital again?
all right, my man. That was my buddy from the force.
I asked him to keep his ear to the ground about any missing women.
there's another one?
no, but a sophomore at Chesapeake University was attacked 2 days ago.
luckily, she was able to get away.
he thought there might be a connection, so he decided to call me.
have the police shown her the poster?
no. She had a mental breakdown and she isn't talking.
what exactly is happening? Thank you.
Hey, look, I don't want to be on camera. What are you...
damn it! I gotta go.
Aw, man. I am such a klutz.
I - oh, geez. I left my opposable thumbs at home.
let me buy you another one.
no, it's OK.
no, really, it's not. Here.
another one of what I just spilled and a raspberry tart.
you ok with raspberry?
Yeah, sure.
a lot of action, huh?
no, no, no. Usually just dull stuff.
old ladies smuggling perfume.
Mmm. Well, maybe dull is good.
whatever you're doing now is stressing you out.
ha! Yeah, it's ironic.
I'm usually the one to read people, but you're right.
I am stressed.
then you need to relax.
you know, I'm going to a concert tomorrow night.
mostly Vivaldi. You want to come?
it doesn't have to be like a date or anything.
you could meet me there.
no, yeah. I'd really like to go.
let me give you my number.
did I mention I know your boss?
what?
see, he thinks I'm some kind of psycho killer.
I get women alone, attack them.
what do you want?
to make a point.
and what point would that be?
if Lightman was right about me, you'd already be dead.
so, to be clear, the Lightman group is putting its hard-won reputation on the line for a UFO sighting?
now that we have a second eyewitness and physical evidence, we think that it's time that we got some answers from our government.
aren't you worried this could become a national security issue?
if the Air Force is telling me the truth and they didn't pick up an object this size, then we've already got a huge problem.
Mr. Hickson is telling the truth.
when you know that, why not bet the ranch?
I'm gonna show you a picture, OK?
is this the man who attacked you?
that's a "yes."
the police interviewed Martin.
want to take a look at this case file?
Nah, they probably would let him go with an apology.
Yeah, you got that right.
Hey. Dummies.
I thought you was off chasing UFOs?
Yeah, well, the office told me where you were.
that's him. This guy. He...
this guy - he just bought me a cup of coffee and he was gonna take me to a concert, but I was...
how did you realize that that was him?
Ah, he said he knew Lightman.
said that if he was really the killer, I'd be dead.
is that the girl he attacked?
Oh, yeah.
you OK?
Yeah, she'll be fine.
well, now you're here, make yourself useful.
go in there and bond with Valerie over being alive.
I understand, Valerie.
what happened to you-- it almost happened to me, too.
look at me, Valerie.
this guy bumped into me at a pastry shop.
by the time we got outside, he felt like a friend.
and that's what he does. He appeals to who we are, like he sees us when nobody else does.
look, I know this is painful, but you're alive, Valerie.
the next girl might not be.
he drowned me...
over and over.
all that water.
I died...
3 times.
bastard waterboarded her.
I'm so sorry.
and...
when I would come to, his mouth would be on mine.
and then he would do it again and again.
I begged him to just let me die...
but he wouldn't.
maybe he did.
can you bring him in now?
hell, yeah.
Valerie identified you as her attacker.
I'm sorry for her.
I really am.
but if the police believed her, wouldn't I be under arrest?
you stalked her.
did Cal coach the girl, get her to name Martin?
I know how manipulative he can be.
she was barely responsive.
well, if you see her file, she spent half her life on antidepressants.
here's how it really happened. Valerie came on to me.
well, you should know that we're getting a warrant to search your car.
now, if we find any evidence that she was in it
you will. I gave her a lift home one night from the library.
Yeah, but see, the thing is, she never made it home.
you tried to drown her 3 times.
then you dragged her into the woods and tried to bury her.
that never happened.
I mean, she's obviously troubled. Anyone can see that.
that's why you picked her.
she's troubled. She's vulnerable.
you prey on the weak, right, Martin?
listen, all I was doing was showing the girl some kindness.
no. She's the perfect victim.
you like to traumatize her, you break her, she begs to die, and she's just your type.
that's not true.
I like strong women.
Oh, like Helen, you mean?
she's a strong woman. Tell me, how does that work,
I mean, with you two?
do you play the woman in that whole scenario, do you?
I mean, who's the pitcher, who's the catcher?
are you just following orders?
I mean, you do what she says, is that it?
I wouldn't worry, though.
Oh, I'm sorry.
did you think what was going on between you two was real?
did you?
well, take it from me, it's not.
I've been there.
no, she's had dozens.
she gets bored, she moves on.
like hell!
I think we're done here, aren't we, Martin?
if you say so.
Martin's gone.
you seen enough?
he never admitted to anything.
what, did you expect him to?
must be frightening, falling for a monster.
OK, so you know.
I figured that's why you had a problem with him, the fact that he and I were...well...
Oh, and now you know better.
well, you should.
right, come with me.
where are we going?
scene of the crime.
he tortures and kills young girls.
every girl he tortures or kills is on your conscience, Mrs. Walker.
I only let you in here because Helen has been a friend to Martin.
nonsense. You feel guilty 'cause you got a killer for a son.
how come there's no pictures of your daughter anywhere?
did he kill her?
did he push her in the pool?
you can't face the truth, can you?
so you pretend she doesn't exist, she never existed.
I mean, that's the game here.
right?
please. I put my trust in Martin, my faith.
I do care about him.
now I need to know.
well, that's one hell of a rogue's gallery.
world's greatest con men.
Yeah, more like psychos.
Yeah.
to live with themselves, to deny their humanity, it's quite a trick.
you know, if you can pull off something like that, it's not really hard to fool the rest of us.
your friend Loker told me.
Yeah.
I should have seen it.
Ah, kiddo. You probably got him right.
me, too, for that matter.
what do you mean?
well, I am a crackpot.
it's not all I am, but it's the truth from time to time.
and in a small enough moment, even a cold-blooded killer can be sincere, seem charming even.
now, how he got that way, well,
I don't think that a mystery anybody can solve.
it must be hard, being somewhere 30 years and trying to make sense of all this.
what's hard is they confuse growing old with growing stale.
Mr. Hickson.
I'm Colonel Gorman.
you were looking for answers. I've got some for you.
is there some place we can talk privately without big brother?
ever heard the term "shattered bone"?
it's Air Force code for a bomber that's hijacked or missing with a nuke on board.
this is what your client witnessed 2 weeks ago.
that's Captain Eric Eeubauer, decorated veteran.
cracked, and broke radio contact.
we shot him down 500 miles off the Carolina coast.
this was not a standard-issue aircraft, but this does seem like a standard issue lie.
it might not have looked like it on the ground, but there's a flash drive with cockpit video in the file.
so what do you want us to do?
you want us to go along with some sort of coverup?
I wouldn't call it that.
what happened was a tragedy for the pilot's family and an embarrassment for our base.
are you nervous, Colonel?
this is a sensitive case.
I told my C. O. that given your relationship with the FBI that we could trust you
I wish the feeling were reciprocal.
the best lies are covered with half-truths.
I have no doubt that you had a pilot who cracked, who was shot down
everything in that file happened as described.
you have no idea what was in the sky that night, do you?
that's the best answer you're going to get out of us,
Mr. Loker.
if your client's smart, he'll accept it.
smart?
or spineless.
the Air Force is never going to admit to a violation of U. S. air space, not by a Russian MIG or by a UFO, you and I know that.
but we also know that what Mr. Hickson saw was not a B-1.
so what there was a way for the Air Force to cover its ass and also save a teacher's job?
look, Martin, it's over.
let's not make a thing out of this.
Lightman's behind this, isn't he?
no, he isn't.
I don't believe you.
you've been different since that day in class.
he may have started me thinking about us, what we're doing, but that's all.
you said you loved me.
Yes, and I know I shouldn't have.
I'm sorry. That wasn't fair.
that I was important to you.
your work is important to me.
we can still be friends, work together.
we still have that.
let go of me!
hello. Dezekis.
Dean Warren?
Yes, Dean Warren, one minute.
OK, Helen.
look, I understand. Big age difference. I'm sorry.
well done, luv.
all the right notes.
what now?
well, with any luck, he'll come after you with a vengeance.
Oh, God.
don't worry, Professor Dezekis. We have eyes on you.
Helen. You sound off.
nice read. Very perceptive.
Yeah, well, I can be from time to time.
can we talk later?
Yeah, it's a date.
I told you, Lightman.
I'm always 5 moves ahead.
welcome back, Lightman.
you ready to die... again?
you know if you kill me, right...
they'll do you for murder.
I mean, right now you could probably plea bargain it down to kidnapping or forced labor or something.
you know what you need, Lightman?
you need a gun, but you don't have one, do you?
I've got you thinking, though, don't I?
I mean, it's funny.
a minute ago, you were in full control.
now look at you.
you know, after I get done here,
I'm gonna take care of Helen.
and I'm gonna bury you side by side.
be romantic.
there's a girl buried around here?
how many?
this is boring, Lightman. Keep digging.
Oh, sorry. I'm stalling.
you do know I've got a GPS tracker on the van.
have some dignity, for God's sakes.
don't humiliate yourself.
you do the bloody digging. Go on.
you do it.
that just means you'll die for real soon.
Yeah, the shrink's gonna have a field day with you.
you know that, don't you?
I mean, what is it with you animals?
did you push your sister in the pool?
no.
she fell.
you didn't help her, though, did you?
you just watched her drown.
Yes.
Why?
I wanted her bike.
drop the gun! Drop it!
drop the gun! Drop it!
it's like you said.
they only have me on unlawful detainment at worst.
she's buried somewhere here.
she's probably just before the road.
there aren't any bodies, Lightman.
when they rolled up, you looked.
you looked towards the trees.
that's where your secret is, right?
sweep the area!
right? You owe me 200 bucks!
you bastard!
in vino veritas?
that's the only truth I'm gonna get apparently.
I just perpetrated a lie on an entire school.
well, I thought the F-88 was a good compromise.
I mean, it could have been what he saw.
Yeah...but it wasn't.
you saved a man's career.
that's no small feat.
what do you think that is?
I don't think that's a mystery anyone can solve.
Hey.
so they dug up 4 bodies.
I didn't see it, Cal. I...
I mean, not at first anyway.
I could have saved you some grief.
that's OK.
take it out of your wages.
you thought I was obsessing on Helen, right?
it's not beyond the realm of possibility.
you loved her, didn't you?
we had our moments.
Oh, it's not like she's Helen of Troy or anything.
fancy a quick bite?
Thanks. I've got work.
OK. Another time then.
Yeah. Another time.
I'm glad you're OK.
night, then.
night.
let's hear it for the Sermonson High School marching band.
good job.
great job.
it is my sincere hope that this center will become a beacon of academic excellence in an underserved community for years to come.
clara, would you do the honors, please?
of course.
thank you, Mrs. Musso, for your friendship and generosity.
you're welcome, Governor.
thank you, ladies.
for many years, and I speak to you today not as a politician but along with my wife as parents.
public education in America has been in peril.
you know the refrain... lack of funds, underqualified teachers, negligent parents.
and to this I say, no more excuses.
the guy in the denim jacket, do we know him?
vote for accountability.
cast your vote for - Denim jacket.
vote for this great state of Virginia. - Governor, your car's waiting.
thank you, kind voters of Virginia.
thanks very much for coming out.
appreciate the support.
thank you. Thanks very much for your help.
it's nice to see you today.
great to see you. Thanks very much for your support.
let's go get them. Let's get out and vote, huh?
thanks for your support.
thank you for the support.
the Governor's down. He's hit.
there's no such thing as an "assassin's gaze."
all right. So I can report back that you can't tell if Duane Corey was acting alone.
didn't say that.
no, he had an accomplice. It was the Governor.
what? Come on.
I know. It turns your stomach, doesn't it?
the governor knew Michelle Daly.
of course he knew her. She was a staffer.
no, he "knew" knew her. Know what I mean?
flirtatious, flared nostrils, admiring look.
Yeah, she really fancied him.
the FBI is paying you to find out if the Governor was acting alone, not dig into the governor's personal life.
no, the FBI's paying me to poke around and, you know, find the truth.
I'm not a glorified cop, Ben.
foster, show Reynolds the situation.
the governor's in a tight race. Too close to call.
a staffer who was clearly more than that was shot dead.
now the man's back up in the polls.
you can't ignore the possibility that the girl was just a victim of a 9-point bullet bump.
where are you going?
to see the Governor.
Cal, listen. Brooks isn't just any old governor.
I know. He's a close and personal friend of yours.
I appreciate this must be difficult for you.
as the majority stakeholder in this firm... - see, I bet that you regret saying that already.
just go easy on him.
OK? I respect this man a lot.
someday he could be president.
not with this girl's blood on his hands, he won't.
the democratic process is no stranger to hardship and suffering, but the death of Michelle Daly is especially cruel and incomprehensible.
Dr. Foster. Or may I call you Gillian?
I see Clara Musso called to give you a heads-up.
which is why my will to win this race is only strengthened by all our desires, each and every one of us to stand strong in the face of adversity.
so I invite all of you to join my staff, my family, and me, in our prayers for the family of Michelle Daly in the wake of this terrible tragedy.
which is why the Governor here has decided to retain the Lightman group to get to the truth behind all of this.
Dr. Lightman, I've read all your books. Big fan.
that's cobblers. Try and change the subject. All right?
not with me.
ladies and gentlemen, the Governor would like to invite you all to warm up your coffees and grab some more pie before he continues the question and answer segment of today's visit.
please. Help yourselves.
I'm not sure I follow.
well, do your best, Governor, you know, for the dead girl in the morgue.
I beg your pardon?
no, don't beg. See, look, it frightens the voters.
governor? - Not a good idea.
this is Lightman being discreet.
if Michelle daly's not enough to haunt the Governor for the truth, Lightman is.
what do you want from me?
well, a 9-point bump in the polls 24 hours before the election because a girl took a bullet for you.
I want a little bit more than coffee and pie. Know what I mean?
my place or yours?
if it were a choice between losing the election and having Michelle back with us, I'd gladly choose the latter.
my place, then. Let's keep it official.
clear his schedule this afternoon.
no more excuses, Governor.
Brooks is a dog that needs to be taken out back and put down.
no. That guy's a lone wolf.
no way he's gonna help Corey.
Oh, well, you know, don't lose hope.
we still have 42 more videos of guys who claim that they want Brooks dead.
are you chatting online while I'm over here looking for an assassin?
what? - You have a new girlfriend?
no. No, no, no, no. Just a friend who happens to be a... - Emily Lightman?
please try not to judge.
you're cyberfriends with Emily?
judgment all over your face. Look, she friended me.
she's the boss's daughter. What am I supposed to do?
hit "ignore."
look, she's going to musicfest this weekend.
Yeah, as are half the kids in dc. So?
so it's a breeding ground for negative group behavior.
drinking, drugs.
Loker, I've been to musicfest. You're blowing it way out of proportion.
well, you're not 16 years old.
last year, 3 girls got roofied and raped.
you should read some of the things that her so-called friends are writing about doing there.
I mean...If she were my daughter, I would...
you know, I should give Lightman a heads-up.
look. How many friends does Emily have on that site?
500 or 600. - Exactly.
she probably barely knows the kids who are writing all this stuff on her site, if at all.
Oh, God. What'd you do? - Nothing.
told her I might be going to musicfest, too.
what is wrong with you?
we got a confession.
out of who? - Duane Corey.
you know, the guy that security grabbed after the shooting.
well, his cellmate came forward about an hour ago.
says that Corey was bragging about trying to kill the Governor.
gave up his whole plan... weapon cache, location, everything.
an inmate with nothing but incentive to lie about Corey's confession.
Yeah, well, Lightman thinks I should bring you two to come check this guy out with me, so, let's go.
I love politicians. I do. I really do.
are you comfortable?
can we get on with this?
governor, try to answer our questions with as much accuracy as you can.
Yes, I am comfortable in this glass box.
a man in your position. - Correct.
up in the polls.
survivor of an assassination attempt.
I would never exploit a tragedy like this for a... - Bullet bump.
Yeah. See, now I said it, so you don't have to.
you're way off base, Dr. Lightman.
so, I have to ask, why all the guilt, Governor?
a girl died.
looks more like fear to me. What you frightened of, eh?
someone tried to kill me at that rally.
Yeah, but a girl died instead. What was her name?
separation of first and last name - the personal with the formal.
so, she wasn't just any old girl to you, was she, Governor, and don't tell me that all depends on what my definition of "was" is.
she was one of our college volunteers.
it was no secret she knew me.
how well would you say you knew her?
hardly at all.
we might've made small talk.
Might've? - And it could've been more than just small talk.
it wasn't.
declarative. Commanding.
you wanted to make sure it was never more than just small talk.
you sure it wasn't pillow talk?
absolutely not.
clarifying language. Defensive.
there was a misunderstanding that could've been misconstrued.
wires were crossed.
governor, man to man, right, and Foster here.
Michelle was a beautiful woman.
now, I know what it's like to work with beautiful women.
he's talking about your friend Clara Musso.
Yeah, and her, yeah.
we both know that there are women out there that are naturally attracted to power.
so, Governor, out with it.
there was one night a few months ago.
I had just won the primary.
alcohol was flowing and I'd had a few drinks.
it had been a rough campaign.
my wife had headed home early.
that seems like the night in question.
Michelle and I wound up smoking a cigarette together.
shared it.
she complimented me on my win.
we talked for a long time.
stealing away like that... It made me feel young.
it was innocent.
but not to Michelle.
she was confused that my wife had left early and here was the governor enjoying the taste of a young woman's lipstick on the filter of a cigarette.
we both know that this isn't about a confusion of a young woman anymore, don't we?
you had sex with her.
that night. Admit it.
it was one of those moments.
everyone celebrating, schmoozing, and here she is, showing me such simple, sure...
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You took advantage of her, didn't you?
nothing happened.
yet you were ashamed. Why is that?
Trevor Addison walked in before I could do anything I'd regret.
if he hadn't...
he and I decided then to distance Michelle from me.
he reassigned her.
why keep her around at all?
I wasn't about to cut a promising career short just because I almost...
could have crossed the line.
your future president's more lucky than good.
he didn't cheat, and he had no reason to have her killed.
could we just leave him alone now?
he's explained his actions but not the others who work on his behalf.
he's a governor, Gillian, not a mob boss.
Oh, that sounds like a much better campaign slogan than "no more excuses."
I didn't do it.
Corey, come on, man.
they found your gun right there on the scene when they took you down.
you were caught red-handed.
I'm telling you, it's not mine.
so, what are you saying?
well, it's a conspiracy.
to frame you for the murder of Michelle Daly.
I didn't kill her.
you didn't mean to kill her, because you were aiming for the governor, right?
there. Right there. What you just did with your nostrils, that tells me that you want Governor Brooks dead.
I didn't shoot that girl, and that gun is not mine.
stop lying.
I'm not. I'm innocent.
I believe him.
that's fear of this place.
same as his.
what? - Corey didn't do this.
don't you understand? He already said that he did, though.
Yeah, to his cellmate, which, by the way, why did you say that, Corey?
they think twice about raping cold-blooded killers in here.
and you really believe that he didn't do this?
I know he didn't.
take us back to the night of the primary.
no messenger on that. Take it over in person. Get a signature.
thank you.
the night of the primary.
when you found the Governor celebrating privately with Michelle.
Yeah, that night of the primary.
I handled the situation. I spoke with Michelle and found her a more suitable position.
so, one chat with you and she was out of the inner circle.
it's my job to insulate the Governor.
very smooth. Hence the strut.
or is that just like a side effect of being around all this totty office? Eh?
so, how long did it take you to get Michelle in the sack, then?
I'm a single man, Dr. Lightman.
I work 100-hour weeks.
Michelle was a beautiful, young woman.
what, you mean to tell me that neither of you have ever been tempted to mix business with pleasure?
excuse me, but the woman you were sleeping with was killed on your campaign trail.
you don't seem too shaken up by that.
I cut Michelle's family a check for funeral expenses.
Oh, that's nice of you. - To get through the terrible days ahead.
now, if you don't mind... see that clock over there?
19 hours until the polls open... and counting.
I've got a question for you.
you know the man that was arrested for the shooting, right?
how does a nutter like that get through your security?
I like a man who can own up to his own mistakes, don't you?
he cut a check.
now you think Addison had Michelle killed?
well, you know, he used to be a lobbyist for security contractors.
OK, so Addison's sleeping with Michelle, and let's say, for whatever reason, he wanted to have her killed.
why do it in such a public way?
well, it's two birds with one bullet.
Michelle's a goner and Brooks is a winner.
he gets one of his black ops buddies to do the job. No one's the wiser.
it's absurd, Cal. He's not that kind of man.
so, what kind of a man is he, exactly?
he's tried it on with you, hasn't he?
please.
eyes front, Clara. This is important.
hasn't he?
well, I can't say as I blame him, really.
excuse me?
that was supposed to be a compliment.
compliment. That's funny. It felt more like an insult.
he's a player.
women like Michelle are just a number to him.
you mean women like Michelle and me.
no, because you turned him down, right?
see? I told you I was good at this.
now, I don't think that Michelle was the only woman that he was polling on the campaign trail.
the Brooks campaign has tons of women working for it.
let's not start a witch hunt.
witch hunt.
is that what you call them?
lemmings.
all right.
who here, apart from Michelle Daly, has been shagging the chief of staff?
bingo. Lady in pink.
what made you suspect that Michelle and Addison were also having an affair?
she went from part-time volunteer to paid staff. Came out of nowhere.
so, you see the advantage of sleeping with Addison, right? You know how the game's played?
but Michelle wasn't a game player, was she?
Michelle was wholesome.
what? Meaning she was naive and innocent?
she wore a promise ring.
planned on saving herself for whatever.
whatever, said with an edge of contempt.
she was a good person.
see, you had to control every muscle in your body from your head to your toes to pull that one off.
it's true. - I don't doubt it.
I'm talking about the anger you feel for her.
as if she's to blame for you being here in the hot seat with us.
how does Addison get a promise ring off a girl like that, eh?
we all partied just as hard as we worked.
she wanted to fit in. She started off with just the occasional small glass of wine.
and then the wine turns to spirits.
it's ok. We all make mistakes.
Michelle was a grown woman. An adult.
I did not make her drink.
I did not steer her towards Trevor Addison.
you're doing everything you can to avoid the elephant in the room, aren't you?
elephant in the room... - why a promising young woman was murdered.
they were shooting at the Governor.
Oh, you're a cop now, are you?
they had to shoot past the Governor to get to Michelle.
let's treat it as murder for now.
see, there it is again.
fear. And anger.
I mean, I'd feel the same way if I felt I was being forced into a lie.
I haven't lied. - Smart.
true, too, technically.
because you know how to steer a conversation and you know how to lie by omission.
I smell a cover-up.
I've been there. I've done that.
I'm not involved.
I mean, I hear things, but I... I didn't do anything.
now what you're doing is stonewalling.
you've gone from gossip to accomplice.
after Michelle started sleeping with Addison, she started drinking even more.
at the commonwealth fundraiser last month, she got totally bombed.
and she threatened to go public with the affair.
Addison sent her home before she could make a scene and she drove up a curb where a man was collecting bottles and cans.
said she didn't even realize she hit someone at first.
so, it was a hit and run?
Addison made her turn herself in and then it just...
and I have no direct knowledge of a cover-up, but I'm guessing Addison got the incident swept under the rug.
and the man she hit?
he died after a few days.
a drunk staffer kills someone leading up to election, you want to make it go away.
in a close election, you want more than that. You want the girl to go away, right?
you know, a couple of my agents found your little hideout.
the guns.
ammunition.
Plus, the crosshairs you drew on Brooks's photo speaks to malicious intent.
I bought those to protect the Governor.
Brooks was in danger.
Yeah, well, I'd have to agree with you on that.
you don't understand. I sent those e-mails so the staffers would tighten up security.
they're not real.
Brooks... he needs a guardian.
someone like me.
right, right. Duane, let me explain something to you.
you can try and play crazy for the jury.
that's not gonna fly in here.
from your collection.
what the hell?
he doesn't even recognize the murder weapon.
this should be in an evidence room.
can you playback? - yeah
there. Instant genuine surprise.
he's never seen it before.
because it ain't mine.
does he want Brooks dead? Yes.
is he dangerous? You bet?
all right, so then he's delusional.
he thinks he's got a special relationship with the Governor.
the gun's a throwaway.
it's not that hard to file numbers off a handgun, and anybody could have just planted it near Corey the day of the shooting.
the guy's a patsy. - Yeah, well, he's gonna be in here on gun charges.
so, regardless, he's gonna have to sit tight till we can figure this thing out.
so, whoever killed Michelle could have known about Corey's threats, made sure he had a clear path to Brooks on the day of the shooting so they could pin it on a wacko.
just a minute!
Oh, hang on.
hello.
so, did he send you over here to appeal to my better judgment?
no, he didn't.
that's good, 'cause I've done everything.
that's what I told him.
you hungry? - Oh, you cook, too?
Oh, yeah.
sure. - There's chicken masala.
so, be warned.
do you want a beer? - Sure.
you know, I told the governor that I owe my freedom to your bull-headed, obnoxious, no-holds-barred way of doing things.
up yours. - Right now?
Ooh, I say.
so, how's he doing, then?
the governor, I mean. You know, behind closed doors.
he's distraught.
we all are for Michelle and her family, not just for his political career.
Oh, yeah.
he's not broken up enough to pull out of the race, though, is he?
Oh, come on. A life of service is all Brooks has ever believed in.
ought to clean house.
you're talking about Trevor Addison, the campaign manager, on the eve of an election.
no, I'm not.
I'm talking about the Governor doing right by that girl's family, you know, and by the voters. Excuse me.
excuse me. - Excused.
thank you.
well, I'm here to tell you that he wants you to find the truth, no matter what.
Oh, what, so you appealed to his better judgment, then, did you?
... Like you, he hasn't sp...
too hot for you?
it's good. It's good.
would you like another beer?
are you trying to get me drunk? - Who, me?
no. Never. Absolutely not.
I couldn't find a recycling bin.
we know about Michelle's hit and run.
that man's death was an awful tragedy.
Yes, kind of tragedy that could kill a political career, unless your name's Kennedy, of course.
I'm paid to manage situations, Dr. Lightman.
by squeezing the D. A. who's looking for the Governor's endorsement?
it was an accident, and I tried to minimize the damage.
that's the damage.
Yep. The dead man, in case you were interested.
I know his name.
after the accident, there was nothing I could do for him.
he was hit near a stop sign.
it was very hard to see at night.
that almost looks like genuine remorse.
I'm sorry the man is dead.
must be a pain in the...I mean cover-ups.
managing them, you know.
look, Michelle was a kid at the beginning of her career.
I wasn't gonna let her go to prison over a youthful indiscretion.
or let the press find out.
all right. Full disclosure.
check's in the mail. You don't look fat in that dress.
Robin spoke with me about your conversation yesterday.
I was gonna head to your office after the polls close.
with something that might help you.
after the polls closed.
what I'm trying to tell you is...
let Michelle daly speak for herself.
after my car hit the curb,
I just... I just took off, 'cause I didn't know what to do.
and I didn't know that I had hit someone.
I really didn't.
I was drunk.
unusually matter of fact for someone on the heels of a traumatic event.
no sadness. No remorse at all.
Yeah, I don't doubt that she was drunk that night, but I don't think she was driving that car.
her confession is pure fiction.
she's covering up for somebody.
sad part is that whoever it was had her convinced she was doing the right thing.
Eli, what's up?
I was just thinking about you.
you were?
Yeah, and music fest.
Yeah, I'm really excited for p-funk.
Yeah, well, you're an old soul. You're a very funky old soul.
Thanks. - I'm also a p-funk fan.
Really?
sure.
so you're coming?
Yes, if your dad lets me off work in time.
cool. You can meet my friends.
Yeah, your friends.
sure, why not.
Hey, listen to this.
that's great.
look, Em, sometimes at these festivals, there can be a diffusion of responsibility.
you know, you must not be that big of a p-funk fan 'cause you do want to hear this.
I just mean that sometimes inhibitions can go down.
and something that may not have normally happened could happen.
or, you know, maybe... maybe it would.
all right, these guys.
bad idea. Keep your distance.
Eli, I barely know them.
good.
then your distance will be kept because from what I'm reading, these guys are bringing an entire pharmacy to the concert.
Ecstasy...Speed... Roofies?
and you're worried something might happen to me?
well, I care about you, Em.
you're sweet.
good. - And I care about you, too. Really.
good. So, you'll be careful.
so careful. Just relax.
OK. Em, God, no, no.
I'm... I'm sorry.
I just... you kept IMing me and... never mind.
I was IMing you back to be polite.
no, Em, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like...
I'm so fired.
this a bit previous, isn't it?
polls haven't even closed yet.
if you're looking for my husband, he's at a press op for the next few hours.
is that the one where they go in the little booth and they vote for themselves?
that's the one.
something I said?
we don't believe Addison's story about the hit and run.
what hit and run?
what was that? - What?
what was that between you just now? What was that? - Nothing.
you should really leave the lying to the politician's wife.
she's had a lot more practice than you have.
we believe that Michelle took the fall in order to cover for someone else.
someone else?
how much did the Governor have to drink the night of the fundraiser?
what? - No, no,'cause I can see he likes to drink.
I can see that much.
I won't stand here while you throw darts in the dark, indict my friends and my husband with your pseudo-science.
look, Mrs. Brooks. Michelle Bailey admitted to a hit and run that she had absolutely nothing to do with.
and now she's dead.
and you are a bully, digging through a decent man's trash.
no one's perfect. You'll find lies wherever you look.
how about you, darling?
how'd you get home that night? 'Cause you were there, weren't you?
Yes, that was the night I spilled wine on my dress.
red wine. Pinot. Argentinian.
what vintage?
nothing special.
you see, like I said, we should really leave the lying to her, 'cause she's much better at it than you are.
actually, Jenna and I left together.
I dropped her off at her house.
Janet's using Clara.
you're incredible.
or the other way around, you know. Incredible how?
you know. - Oh, Clara.
it's that obvious, is it?
was it that good?
honestly? - No.
cause that's what they were doing when we showed up.
they were getting their stories straight.
the pinot noir.
Yeah, I mean, do they even make that in Argentina?
Alfredo Roca, 2007.
not just a pretty face, are you?
back to you and Clara. - Really?
well, she's up to something, and I want to make sure you're not compromised.
no, no, it was just a bit of fun between us.
it was a little bit more than that.
were you there?
I'm talking about from her perspective.
you don't read faces, do you?
did I say incredible? I meant impossible.
thank you very much.
let's say that Clara was driving the car and she ran over the homeless guy.
are you accusing Clara?
no, it's just theory. I'm just posing a theory.
the Brooks campaign might feel obligated to help cover it up.
she is their biggest campaign donor.
I need to talk to you in private.
Yeah, what is it?
so, it started... Emily, she friended me on this website.
hurry up,'cause I haven't got much time.
right. I was worried about these drugs, these boys...
excuse me?
uh... I just felt that somebody should be looking out for her.
Oh, really?
I... I just think... Emily kissed me.
follow me.
so, you kissed my daughter.
no. No. She put her headphones on me in the lab.
I wanted to show her... - you kissed my daughter.
no, I was trying to help, and she kissed me. - How was it for you?
what? - How was it for you? Was it good? Did it feel good?
no. I mean, I just was trying to help her out.
enough said.
what, Reynolds?
I guess Addison won't be around to see the governor be re-elected.
all right, guys, come on. Everybody out. Let's go.
he's not the suicide type.
Yeah, well, he wrote the suicide note.
he e-mailed everyone on the Governor's staff.
he admits to covering up Michelle's hit and run and that he hired the shooter to kill her before she could talk.
now we have to figure out who wrote this.
yeah,'cause he didn't.
Hey, you seen Lightner?
he's in his office waiting for Clara.
ha. Still fighting that fight, huh?
don't let him fool you. He loves it.
let me ask you something. How can you tell if this thing is fake if it's been typed?
word choice, repetition. The use of passive or active voice can tell you a lot about the person who wrote this.
let me show you.
"a person of my stature,""someone in my position,""with regards to a subordinate..."
this is a person who is preoccupied with power and status.
power and status, huh?
that sounds like the Trevor Addison you were describing earlier.
it's all about the pronouns.
women. We use a lot more pronouns when we write.
"I,""she," "they."
men will typically name the person or thing they're talking about.
so a woman preoccupied with power and status wrote this.
Yep.
Why?
why, it's all there.
he covered up for the hit and runs.
you don't believe that, do you?
another thing or two about suicides...
slippery sorts like Addison, they don't kill themselves.
what, you think he was murdered?
Michelle and Addison, they both knew something that got them killed.
I just hope to hell that you don't know what they knew, love.
you already know I do, don't you?
you didn't drive Janet home that night.
you weren't even in the bloody car.
Janet killed that homeless man.
she was alone. It was an accident.
she was drunk.
Addison made Michelle take the blame, and then he pulled some strings to make it go away.
all except Michelle, and that let loose.
that got taken care of yesterday, didn't it?
Janet and I go way back.
if she knew anything about Michelle's death, I would...
you'd know? She'd tell you, right?
even though you're the major stakeholder in this firm?
that suicide note was written by a woman.
shake. You lied to me.
you covered up for the Governor's wife at the 11th hour.
I want my firm back.
she picked me earlier today.
she just needed a little more time.
shake his hand. I'll be your witness.
you know, these people... they don't deserve your loyalty.
I think you're better than that.
I want to give you a chance to prove it.
what are you doing here?
I told them. Addison left too many loose ends.
I don't want to be involved anymore.
honey, no one's going to take Clara's word over yours.
Addison forced Michelle to keep his secret.
when she wouldn't, he had her killed.
she's lying.
can you prove it?
Yes. The night of the fundraiser.
Addison rode home in my limo.
you can ask my driver.
governor Brooks, Michelle wasn't driving the car that was involved in the hit and run.
she took the fall for someone else.
well, it wasn't Addison, and it certainly wasn't me.
Addison's suicide note was written by a woman.
it was a fake.
well, it could have been Clara.
where were you the night of the hit and run, Mrs. Brooks?
well, Clara gave me a ride home from the fundraiser.
see, even he doesn't believe that one.
congratulations, governor.
Charles, we have to leave now.
even you can't be that stupid.
you must have sensed that something was going wrong.
they said it was nothing.
the FBI are going through your phone records and personal hard drives.
are they gonna find something about the shooter?
the shooter was a crazed, lone gunman.
is it the same one that you hired to take care of Addison in the tub?
I mean, are we gonna find him sitting on the beach somewhere counting your money?
Janet, is there any truth to what they're saying?
Janet, what did you do?
I was the one holding it all together.
I always have been.
you always said I was your rock.
Oh, God. - I was your rock, Charles.
No!
I didn't ask for this.
Yeah, you did, actually, when you stopped asking questions.
what can I do to make this right?
well, you could step down for starters.
personal reasons, whatever. I don't care.
your public's waiting for you, Governor.
we could be a good team.
I got all the team I need.
I know you respect the work we do here, Clara, but sign.
it's a pleasure doing business with you.
Oh, that's an assassin's gaze, if ever I saw one.
you said there was no such thing.
looking for this?
what flavor is it? - Pineapple.
Yeah, it is here.
so, you hit him? - You kissed him.
now he'll never meddle again.
I mean, he may sue you, but at least he'll never meddle.
so, what were you thinking?
I don't know.
Oh, that rings true.
maybe kissing him was a little extreme.
Oh, you reckon, do you?
Yeah, but that makes me the apple that didn't fall far from the tree.
Oh, so, it's my fault, then, is it?
Yeah. It's good you admit this.
no, no, no, no. My point is that it's not Loker's fault, right?
what?
you didn't.
you did, didn't you?
I know you were just trying to look out for her, right?
and I shouldn't have hit you.
I was wrong.
physical violence...
right... is very, very wrong.
apology accepted.
dad, come on. Don't blow the apology.
I'm sorry.
probably should have seen it coming.
what, the kiss?
no, the punch.
you're emotional wildfire where Emily's concerned.
bit of ice cream?
it's pineapple.
I like beer.
go in. Help yourself.
first on the left.
OK.
what if I hadn't apologized?
good girl. Good girl.
the following story is fictional and does not depict any actual person or event.
what do you call that, stupid on a plate?
Hi.
long night, Gillian?
what are you doing here, Cal? I thought you hated this place.
no, it's the best breakfast in town, this one.
you don't even eat breakfast.
a man can change. Hmm.
so you're not here to pry, then?
what, me, pry? - Yeah.
on you, in here? Never.
I'd have thought he'd be bringing you granola in bed by now.
Mmm, close enough.
how you doing, Dave?
Lightman. Why don't you grab that table?
yeah,'cause you don't want to miss this.
I'll see you at the office. - Not if I see you first.
enjoy your eggs. - Oh, I will.
babe, I gotta take this. It's one of the kids from juvie.
Hello?
I can't hear you.
I'll take it outside. - Ok.
you've got to get out of here, you've got to disappear!
do you understand?
where is Captain America, then?
he's working.
Oh, right.
is there a secret that you're keeping for him?
you just can't help yourself, can you?
no, when it comes to you, I can't.
I work for the DEA.
Oh, bulls-eye.
in the juvenile facility, collecting information on a key drug corridor.
what you're picking up on are lies necessary for me to do my job.
right.
I'm sorry.
so you see that girl over there, right?
Yeah, I see her.
she was telling Burns to leave town.
all last night, she sat outside Burns' house with a gun in her lap, while Foster was sleeping inside.
you think she's DEA? - I don't know.
maybe he's just fooling around on Foster.
he's a very naughty boy.
get in.
didn't expect to see you again, huh, Marco?
Hey!
Hey, hey!
we need an airship in pursuit of a white and gray van.
Bravo, delta, 312 Henry.
foster's going to kill me.
try to leave our personal feelings behind on this one.
you mean me, my feelings.
you want me to handle this, or do you...
you have done enough already.
look, if I hadn't have been on this, right,
burns would have just gone "poof"!
and then nobody would have been any the wiser, so...
Dr. Lightman, Dr. Foster, this is Agent Williams of the DEA.
good morning. - How do you do?
before we start, I want to thank you in advance on behalf of the Drug Enforcement Agency for your expertise in this.
I believe Agent Reynolds has brought you up to speed on our progress since Agent Burns' abduction last night.
any demands so far?
not as of yet, no.
he thinks some of the kids from juvie are involved.
Yeah, we got four from in the cube waiting for you.
no, you can crack those kids on your own dime.
I'm...
far more interested in this.
now that is a look I'd like to know more about.
do you know who this woman is?
that was taken last night.
she was with him last night? You didn't tell me that!
I was going to tell you, I was going to tell you.
you see that look on Burns' face?
all right, that's fear, that is.
you want to talk to me about it, or you...
I suppose I'll just have to ask her myself, then, won't I?
I'd have to get clearance.
we scoff at words like that around here. Don't we, Ben?
no, we laugh our asses off.
what's her name, Agent Williams?
I'll let her tell you that.
I'm not going to explain myself. - You don't have to.
look, I get it, you're cross at me.
but I was doing the right thing, you know.
I was looking at Burns. Well, behind your back.
which, by the way, only makes it worse.
Dr. Lightman, ship's leaving.
Whoopty-doo.
no more secrets, right?
prove it.
all right, you know my mom's birthday, right?
all right, you know what I'm talking about then.
OK. Then do you know...
apology accepted. - Great, thanks.
his mother's birthday.
he's probably going to change it now.
Lightman's been keeping a file on Burns.
Why? - 3 guesses...
foster, Foster and Foster.
that's fear in Burns' face.
no more secrets.
you got 20 minutes.
what's a nice girl like you doing in a place like this, eh?
who said anything about nice?
how'd you know Burns?
Dave and I worked undercover.
up till 3 months ago.
you're partners?- Ex-partners.
we lost touch when he was reassigned a few months back.
and the rest?
trying to find him.
Why? Because you think you might be responsible for what happened to him?
who the hell are you to ask that type of...
is that guilt, is it?
guilt? No. Fear.
well, I think you might be next.
all right, that's the small talk out of the way.
his name is little moon, the man who took him.
he's a boy, really.
street name?
about 3 months ago, drug wholesaler named big moon turned up in a dumpster.
moon and son. They keep it in the family, do they?
little moon was just a nothing when it happened.
then he stepped up his game.
got a gun.
why were you talking to Burns a few days back?
trying to warn him.
you know, with some people, it's easier to tell when they stop lying than when they start.
I think you're one of them.
how can you tell when I stop lying?
you shut your mouth.
I might know a guy who used to do business with big moon.
he was big moon's former boss.
he might know where his son's holding Burns.
Hey, Michelle.
how you doing, sweetheart?
what's up?
who's your friend?
I'm a scientist.
you know that guy I used to run with, Gianelli?
he's a cop.
he is?
bullocks, you already knew that.
he reads faces.
they got a name for that where I come from.
common sense.
well, my common sense is telling me that you've already busted Burns as undercover.
well, he's not the only one.
Really? - Yeah.
I didn't know they gave coke whores badges nowadays.
you think I'm a cop?
well, you were the closest to him.
what's his name now? Gianelli? - Burns.
little moon's been following you.
you met with the guy 3 times in the last week.
what's that about?
I shouldn't be here.
well, if you really wanted to leave, your hips would be under that door.
question is, why aren't they?
you outted my partner.
well, that answers that.
you know, we all wondered how a pretty girl like you became tangled with a paper gangster like Marco Gianelli.
hands where I can see them.
she meant that.
it's gotta be hard to keep things straight in your head after all the things you've done.
if you don't shut your mouth, she will shut it for you.
she's not going to shoot me.
you think so? - No.
hands where I can see them.
hop up on my lap, sweetie, huh?
I'll give you a little powder.
for old time's sake.
while you were watching his face, I was watching his hands!
that's your tax dollars at work, mate.
he has a gun.
no, he doesn't.
right, my common sense just saved your life, so you owe me.
I want to talk to half moon.
or whatever it is that he's calling himself.
Yeah.
I got someone here who wants to speak to you.
you're gonna listen to him.
do you understand?
Hello?
Cal Lightman here.
we know who you are, Dr. Lightman.
your boy here Burns told us all about you.
what did he tell you?
not nearly enough.
you know who I am, you know what I do.
so hire me and I'll help you.
now why would I want to do that?
it's not a request.
looks like I don't exactly have a choice, now do I?
not if you want to find out who killed your dad.
can I have your car keys?
Thanks. Get her out of here. Huh?
you're not arresting me?
burns was taken moments after you drove off, right?
we haven't talked about that yet.
so put her in a cube with Torres. We'll get fresh eyes on it.
so where you going? - I'm gonna find Burns.
you want to tell me where that is?
sorry, mate.
if they get a whiff of you, they'll probably kill him.
Hey, Cal. - Did you break into my safe yet?
it's quite a collection.
I'm gonna need the blue file.
keep the copies. I'm on my way.
where are you going?
thanks a lot, I'll take it.
I'm coming with you.
Yeah. Apparently so.
get ready.
does your mom know you're out joyriding?
get in.
hop out.
lose the hood.
I told you to come alone.
you hired the Lightman group, right?
she's part of it.
nice place you got here.
you're little moon, ain't ya?
nice to meet you.
bloodied up.
now, you see, your torture victim, he's going to say anything to make the pain go away.
I mean, let's get your mate up here on the hoist, you know.
let's get him talking about shagging your mom, shall we?
you said you'd help me find out who killed my father.
and if you don't...
OK. Well, I can't read him that.
show me what you do.
then she plays nurse.
OK.
all right, um, a face, it tells the truth.
but you gotta look for a base line.
you know what I mean?
all right, look at him.
where are you?
I don't know where.
no, I know you don't know where you are.
but make somewhere up.
make up a place. Use your imagination.
look at me.
I'm waking at Gillian's.
she's sleeping next to me.
he's using encoded emotion.
it's how most people lie.
there's a wind chime in her room.
Oh, you see that?
you see the lip? That was disgust.
at the wind chime? - At you.
Oh, yeah, well, or your dad, you know.
his father deserved my disgust. He was a coke wholesaler.
anybody could have killed him.
well, that was a general truth.
when he said "anybody," he was being deliberately vague.
what are you doing, Cal? - I'm doing my job.
who killed my father?
well, let her fix him up, and we'll get to that, eh?
Hey, hey, hey!
you're ashamed about how your father died, right?
he was found in a dumpster. - No.
well, he was... yeah, he was, he was chucked out, like garbage...
stop! - All right.
Yeah. Yeah.
look, you're never going to restore your father's honor like this.
you want to talk about honor?
you brought her here.
a woman.
well, you didn't hurt her, did you?
I mean, if you were, you'd have taken her when you took him.
so you've earned my trust.
well, let me earn yours.
all right?
OK, let him down.
OK. You ok?
you ok?
he's young and experienced.
he's trying to fill his father's shoes.
which makes him more dangerous.
Yeah.
what are they doing now? - They're arguing, about whether to kill us or not.
what's the plan?
only stressed.
what is he doing?
you notice anything interesting about little moon over there?
respect, honor, defense of his mom's privates.
he's a principled sociopath.
maybe. - He's ok with danger as long as it sticks to a set of rules.
you think we can use that?
get inside his head.
shake it like a snow globe.
you're going to play them against one another.
pat attention, Burnsy.
we're going to do a little song and dance act.
get up. Up!
move!
move.
so where do you think they may have taken Burns?
little moon's trying to follow his father's footsteps.
I'd say a drop spot.
drop spot?
Yeah, it's a place where dealers go to move product.
it usually has a view.
so their rivals can't rob them.
big moon had a few that he used.
so you think he may have taken them there?
he learned from the best.
why are you so angry in this picture?
I have already told you everything that I know.
you're averting your gaze, you can't even look at it.
burns wouldn't leave town because he was dating your boss.
what's her name again? - Maybe you were jealous and wanted to hurt him.
that's the kind of thinking that's going to get Burns and your bosses killed by teenagers.
see, that's the thing.
you're not upset by that.
you're full of guilt.
look me in the eye and tell me you didn't kill this man's father.
no, me.
in the eye.
not here, all right?
I didn't kill anyone.
all right, I write everything down for shoplifting.
why the fear?
you did it.
you killed him.
no.
you're talking out of your ass.
I'm not seeing what you're seeing.
what's your game?
you jealous?
now that's a deflection, that is.
Deflection? - Yeah.
you can't stand me being around Gillian.
look, mate, this is not about her!
your feelings for her are the only reason that you're here.
you want the truth?
be honest.
you killed him, right?
you're going to get him killed!
admit it. You want her.
Yes, I do.
in the worst possible way.
all right?
now it's your turn.
I've had to pretend to be a scumbag my entire career.
I've done a lot of things that I'm not proud of.
murder's not one of them.
wrong answer.
he's not picking up.
we were supposed to have lunch.
well, the office is closed. They went to a talk.
I'm not 10.
and I know when I'm being lied to.
I'll just wait in his office.
she didn't mean it, she's just worried.
Yeah, well, she's not the only one.
Yeah, do it!
throw him over!
what makes you think he killed your dad, eh?
you just said he did!
and he disappeared once my pops wound up dead.
so, what, you're a detective now, are you?
if he didn't do it, he's got nothing to be scared of, right?
well, apart from the obvious.
throw him over!
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
bring him back.
he's not hiding his own guilt.
he's protecting someone.
who? - I don't know.
another undercover cop, maybe.
you saw that, right?
what? - Of course not.
that's why you need me.
unless I'm under arrest, I would like to leave.
you know, I became an addict working undercover on the job.
this isn't about drugs.
no. The point is, when you're real good at the job, you know, real dedicated...
you start to disappear.
and before you know it, you've lost everything.
and everyone.
but there is one person you haven't lost.
until now.
he's talking about Burns.
being a woman in that world...
things work a certain way.
you don't have the power;
the brute force.
you don't come at things straight on.
you seduce.
when it works.
and when it doesn't work...
it's the other way around.
so you and Burns were involved.
no.
not Burns.
me and the dead man.
I want the name.
did you hear him?
Yeah, he wants names.
names?
there's more than one killer then, eh?
does it matter at this point?
well, it matters to them, yeah.
you know what happens if I give them names?
he kills them and their families.
you don't trade their lives for the life of one man, not even if that man's you.
bloody hell! You really are Captain America, aren't you?
he knows, you know.
who are they?
I don't know.
DEA?
how many?
one? Two?
all right, two it is.
why would DEA kill my Dad?
that's a good question.
his father expanded too fast.
we couldn't reposition our guys.
your Dad was killing off the competition, right?
he was so good at his job, right, that they were scared of him.
who did the hit?
he just told you... 2 DEA agents.
names! - Why is that so important to you?
I need to know if they came to his wake.
I need to know if they shook my grandmother's hand, stood in the mud when the coffin went down.
that was her cover name.
leave her out of it.
Oh, I struck a raw nee there, did I?
she couldn't pull the trigger.
Oh, do me a favor.
I mean, I was with her a couple of hours ago, right, and she almost blew a man's head off over an 8-ball.
I mean, what's the difference between gas and big moon?
ask her. - Well, I would, right?
but she's not here, so I'm asking you.
did she get too close to you?
why couldn't she pull the trigger?
she's pregnant.
your point being?
your dad knocked her up.
as charming as that is.
that's not true!
stop it!
stop it! Stop it!
stop it!
so you had an affair while you were undercover, big deal.
it wasn't just an affair.
it jammed me up; Prevented me from doing my job.
all right, so this guy moon, he had a lot of game.
charisma.
fast talker.
higher ups could see he was going to ruin the sting, so they ordered me to either flip him or kill him.
I was the only one who could get that close.
I couldn't bring myself to do it.
so since you couldn't do it, Burns stepped in, he did it for you.
after moon was whacked, Burns was forced to vanish.
heard little moon was looking, but I never thought he'd find him.
he did.
and now you gotta help us find them.
I told you about all the drop spots.
no. I've been talking to my FBI contacts.
dead end. - You gotta come clean.
I'm done.
listen, you're close with the guy, right?
you spent enough time with him to get involved, and you knew how he did business.
you must have spent time with his son.
I didn't! I didn't even...
what?
the only time I spent with him was during a beating.
little moon was making his first deal.
a bunch of us hooded up and went to the spot where it was happening.
to beat the kid down?
big moon wanted his son to learn how easy it is to get your stash stolen.
the kind of spot someone might use to teach someone else a lesson.
Yeah.
we need to get him to a hospital.
did you hear me?!
oy, moon?
she's talking to you.
you broke his ribs when you kicked him.
he's having a tension pneuno thorax.
what the hell does that mean?
it means he can't talk.
he's faking it.
no, this is not something that you can fake!
one side of his chest is rising and falling!
you a doctor. Fix it.
I'm not that kind of doctor.
then he dies. - If he dies, then you'll never find out what happened to your father.
Hey.
you got a little trouble staying awake, son?
no, man.
can I have a word with you?
in private.
so you are being lied to, right?
you don't think I know that?
no, no, I'm not just talking about her.
I'm talking about, you know...
who's your mate on the right?
Harris. - Yeah, him.
what you mean?
you see when he yawns, it's like a nervous yawn.
it means he's hiding something.
what? - I don't know.
I've known Harris since we was young, so back to your lady friend.
well, she knows that he knows the name of the killer.
right? But if he can't speak, then...
then he can't give me the answer.
trust no bitch.
Yeah. Yeah.
why you helping?
cause I fancy her.
look, have your friend there drop her back at the car.
I'll find out who killed your Dad.
then you can do with Burns whatever you want.
all right? - All right.
you'll make your Dad proud.
all right. - Now watch this.
pack your bags.
what? What? No, hey!
we'll have a little man to man, me and you.
you still got all those bullocks, so you can't talk, right? Right?
I need a knife. Give me a knife. - Cal, Cal! No, Cal!
I'm going to need something like a hollow ball.
like a pipe. - Yeah, a pipe, you know.
give me that straw, that'll do it.
you're going to love this.
Hey, Dad.
we were supposed to have lunch.
just call me back, please.
it's funny how you're creeping on the cop's girl.
doctors be getting a lot more women than cops, even getting lady doctors.
what kind of car you drive?
Prius.
it's deceptively fast.
what you gonna do with that?
well, if what she says is true, he's got air trapped in his chest, we gotta get it out or he's gonna die.
OK, so, now open his shirt.
come on, open his shirt.
all right, pull.
OK, you got a little bit of space between the second and the third rib.
you should start down at the bottom here. That's it.
and you work your way up. Right in there.
keep your finger there. - Now what?
now what you're going to do is take the knife, like that, and you're going to pop the knife in.
you pop it right in, right where your fingers are.
just there, all right?
OK?
there you go, son.
go on.
do it, hah.
you the doctor now.
pop it in. That's it.
do it.
all right, ready? All right, one.
go on.
do it!
that's it, pop it in. Go on.
you can't do it, can you?
give me that, give me that.
give me that.
let's see.
Yeah, I thought as much.
right there.
all right, all right!
I'll talk.
you a pretty lady.
get out.
get out of the car!
open the door, move it!
down on the ground!
Hey, Em.
you ok?
Yeah. Everything's totally normal.
I'm just reading my grandmother's diary that I found in my missing father's safe.
declaration of tax amnesty.
what's that about?
you know, I don't know.
and then there's this.
in conclusion, we find that based on the genetic testing results...
the probability of paternity is 99. 99%.
it says that your Dad's your Dad, Em.
I mean, the test shows that conclusively.
Yeah, but why would he have checked in the first place?
all right, so I understand why you want to protect Russo, right, 'cause she was your partner.
but for the life of me, I couldn't figure out why you wouldn't give up your name.
till a few minutes ago.
one of the people that killed your father is in this room.
him. No, not him.
I wish it was him, you know how I feel about this man, all right.
he is all about rules.
and he's a federal Agent.
as a federal Agent, he is sworn to protect the identity of a confidential informant.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Oh, really?
you want to torture me again?
Yeah, yeah, I do.
I'd love to, but I'll take a rain check on that, all right?
I mean, you can't give it up.
but then I caught the look between these two.
why are you looking at me?
well, I know I'm not a C. I.right, and I'm damn sure he's not.
so...
who's that leave, eh?
you're a C. I?!
No!
sorry, huh.
what's wrong with you, money?
he lyin'.
you yawned.
it's this thing you do.
it means you're lying!
you did hear him, right?
you heard him say "I killed a man."
well, he's talking about your father.
No!
I never killed no man!
you kill my father?
No!
he see your temper and he playing you!
then put your gun down.
no.
you'll shoot me!
put it down!
I loved your father.
loved him.
look at me, fool!
look!
I believe you.
you should have never pointed your gun at me.
get down!
drop the weapon! Drop it!
he made it, eh?
you know him?
I'm the reason he got shot. - Well, he's lucky.
bullet missed his artery. Kid could have died.
he's an adult, though.
I mean, in the eyes of the court.
I'm right, right?
how you doing? You all right?
can I have a minute, love?
so...
you killed a man, right?
moon's father.
cause your partner couldn't.
that's it, right?
I did what I had to do to protect the agents that work for me.
you get that, right?
nice work in there, by the way.
you're one of the best liars that I've seen in a long time.
back at ya.
so you're not just in Gillian's life for a bit of the old, you know.
sex?
you can't say the other word, can you?
love.
Dave. You've got one minute.
they're not going to give me my old life back.
my cover's been blown.
all right.
you're walking? Are you crazy?
Hey. - Up and walking...
Oh, oh, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.
I checked myself out.
I can't blame you, really.
these places will kill you.
I'll meet you back at your apartment. Ok?
I'll see you there.
he doesn't want me to follow him.
no.
they're going to move him.
change his name.
I liked the one he had.
all right, now this is just getting ridiculous, Danielle.
come on, it's like art for your stomach.
it's like hotel art. You leave the tip.
you know, you could have died yesterday.
possibly.
so you admit you're an idiot.
no, because...
if I was an idiot, right, I would get into far more mundane trouble, or, you know, forgetting a lunch date with your daughter.
it's a good thing you never do that.
absolutely, I've grown up.
don't tell me you read your granny's diary.
you read your granny's diary.
and, oh, look at this.
I am 99. 99% yours.
you know, you might want to take this test again.
there's still a . 01% chance that people in the lab were lying.
what, so I might get lucky, you mean?
right.
me and your mom, all right, we gate crashed this awful...
party at Harvard.
I look across the room, and there's your mom.
she's being chatted up by some astronomer.
she's laughing her ass off.
all these jokes, and stuff.
and she's flirting with him, you know, as she does.
and I caught just the tiniest flash of something.
something? - Yeah, something.
it was probably just the earliest bits of you just floating around in there somewhere, you know, 'cause it was around that time.
but I don't know what it was. But...
a scientist's job is to verify, right?
you never trust anyone, do you?
you know, that's why you'll always be alone.
I'm not alone.
the following story is fictional and does no depict any actual person or event.
no distractions. No histrionics.
everyone on the ground!
you stay with him until I reach the teller window.
he'll take care of the cameras and the lights.
me and the others will control the situation while you open the safe.
we're in. We're out.
I need a gun.
36 hours earlier
writin' a book like this is like
well, it's not easy.
you know, it's like a high-wire act, really.
I mean, especially since the whole thing hinges on a science which take my word for it-- in the wrong hands, would be a gaping yawn.
I mean, you can't make sense of what you see, you see?
human face is like a puzzle.
you gotta know what to look for.
this book,it's just not it's not gonna write itself,you know what I mean?
are you saying your science is like art?
small "a.
uh, he's selfish, some say brilliant, but a bully.
he's dangerous. He's a narcissist, and, uh, I can see that you are
you're wondering how it is I've managed to work for him this long, and, uh, you know, the truth is I don't know.
I don't know, but the point is that I'm here now.
Dr. Lightman, let me be completely clear.
you look like you could use a drink. - Beg your pardon?
glass of water just to clear the throat, you know.
back in a jiffy.
Torres, in 2 minutes, right,
I want you to come in my office and tell me I'm needed urgently.
needed urgently where?
I don't know. I don't care, all right?
but make it good, all right?
OK. Yeah. No problem. Uh, why?
is this the Torres group already, or is it still the Lightman group?
right.
it's tap water.
you know, hope that's all right.
save the planet. All that. You know what I mean?
my client, DeWitt and Jones publishing, is tired of waiting for the book they contracted you to write over 2 years ago.
they now need evidence that you're working in good faith commensurate with the generous advance they paid.
or next time we see each other will be in court, and you'll be facing charges of misrepresentation and, uh, fraud.
end of the quarter?
I mean, what do they think I'm writin' here, a check?
that'd be an elegant way out, save the inevitable lien on your assets.
my advice to you-- write the damn book.
it's just tap water! It's not poison!
who was that?
that was someone with more contempt for me than they have for the planet, which is saying something.
she's a 24-karat pit bull, that one.
but then you already knew that, didn't you?
thanks for the heads-up.
have you written even one word of this book?
which, by the way, you failed to ever tell me about.
well, the hard part... - Thank you for calling district bank.
is in here. Rest is easy.
let's hope so, for all our sakes. - Meaning?
this is a business. You may not care about your responsibilities to the rest of us, but please stop acting like you're not even aware of them.
Dr. Lightman, you're needed in the lab urgently.
you're late. - For corporate accounts, press 2.
and you're leaking. - Your approximate wait time is 11 minutes.
Ah, bollocks.
I need access to my account, please.
you see that, right? You see that?
they always look at me like that.
I mean, do I look like a criminal to you? Don't answer that.
Hi. - Pleased to meet you, too.
now, ay attention. Keep up.
you see these two?
they're on the rocks.
she's had it up to here with him, and, uh, he blames her, so now it's all down to the money.
and see this one over here?
that's your average honor student, that is.
or meth head. Possible to be both.
but I digress.
I didn't catch your name.
well, that's because you haven't given me a chance.
how you doin'? You all right?
Yeah.
so are you looking for someone, or, uh, you know, you just casin' the joint?
what? - No, it's all right.
secret's safe with me, as long as you cut me in.
so, uh, when you gonna do it, then?
do what?
rob the bank.
What?! Is it something I said?!
thank you.
Oh, that's interesting.
how much time'd you do?
listen, Buddy, whatever you're sellin', I'm not buyin', all right?
state or federal?
how do you know I was in? - My money's on state.
When'd you get out? Was it days ago?
weeks?
I've been in exactly the same place as you are now.
I doubt that.
in answer to your question, I read faces.
I didn't ask you anything.
Yeah, you did. Not only that,
I used to work in that bank, so I've got the added edge.
you worked in that bank?
Yep, corporate office downtown. Why?
nothin'.
you sure about that, are you?
what's my face sayin' right now?
you wanna hit that bank so much, it scares you.
I wanna hit that bank as bad as you do, worse, probably.
could I just eat my breakfast in peace?
good luck.
you're gonna need it.
Mr. Lightman.
let me guess. Bad news about my accounts, which you're secretly enjoying.
sorry to keep you. Sandy Baxter, branch manager.
tell me I'm wrong, Sandy.
tell me my accounts haven't suddenly and mysteriously been frozen.
maybe you'd like to discuss this somewhere a little more private.
Ah, pull the other one.
Mr. Lightman, there's really no need to adopt that tone with me.
first off, to you, Sandy, it's Dr. Lightman.
Dr. Lightman. Of course.
secondly, you're about to get robbed.
excuse me. - Robbed. You know, cleaned out, hit hard, guns and that.
you follow?
Yeah.
so he was mappin' your camera blind spots.
I noticed,'cause I backed him out of one, which is why you see him there.
so he's a pro? - Well, if he was that good, it'd take me a little longer than 2 minutes to spot him.
why didn't your rent-a-cop spot him?
well, you see the world differently, Mr. Ligh
Dr. Lightman, notice things others don't.
he recognized him, which makes me think inside job.
John Agro? He's been at the bank 8 years.
I know his wife. - No one robs a bank alone.
can you prove any of this?
I intend to.
you can't prove a thing.
well, even so, I'd call the cops if I were you.
and tell 'em what, the facial-tic guy says we're about to get robbed?
no cops, then? That's what you're saying?
correct. - That doesn't come cheap.
you think you and me, we can work together?
is that it?
you think you can follow a few simple instructions?
simple instructions?
you know this man?
never seen him.
why the fear of someone you've never seen before, then?
I'm telling you I don't know the man.
Oh, that's just not true.
so if you've never seen him...
you've either smelled him, or you recognized his voice.
recognized his voice. See how your face flinched?
directly linked to the muscles in your sphincter.
on my way home a few nights ago, I
some guys came up behind me, blindfolded me, took me to a room, handcuffed me to a rail.
they wanted blueprints and the combination to the vault.
they knew what they were doing, and they'd done their research.
they knew my wife has Lupus, where she goes to the doctor, where my daughters go to school, which classes they take.
they threatened my family.
you haven't given them anything, though, have you?
right?
but you came this close.
when you recognized his voice in the bank, you figured your time to think was over.
I'm gonna need those blueprints and the combination to the vault. You have 'em?
what do you need the blueprints and vault combination for?
you froze my assets. - I froze our assets, Cal.
look, it's funny,'cause I remember hiring you, but I don't remember marrying you.
you're gonna do something insane to help that bank guard.
absolutely certifiable.
please tell me there's a method to your madness.
well, a man's family got threatened. You know what I mean?
2 of 'em, actually.
2 family men? Who's the other one?
well, the guy I saw casing the bank, right, he's not exactly your armed-robber type. You know what I mean?
little bit more to him than meets the eye.
you didn't hire me.
you asked me to be your partner.
I practically begged you, if I recall.
those were the days, eh?
I'll have Loker and Torres interview everybody at the bank.
and find out who knew that the guard's wife had Lupus.
and unfreeze my assets.
Oh, I'm sorry.
our assets.
unused round. - Safety's still on. She panicked.
Uhh. Can you throw some more coffee grounds in the pan?
this one's really startin' to stink.
Hey, there, eh?
I'm with her.
last time I saw you, you maced me.
that's 'cause you broke into my house.
she didn't know her killer.
what? How can you tell that?
well, that's fear, that is, all over her face.
no contempt there.
not just another pretty face, huh?
I need an I. D. tech.
what did he steal, a pen?
Nah. They got chains on 'em.
Hey, run this for me, would you?
smells like a barista's underpants in here.
look, I'm telling you, although this Sarah Lange has the right qualifications on paper, she is not an ideal candidate.
Loker, I hear your concern, and I get where you're coming from, but please just do as I ask.
ask? You mean tell.
I knew you understood.
can you give me a reason??
ideal is overrated.
Lightman is gonna chew her up and spit her out.
or maybe he'll choke.
bank job.
good case. Good collar.
federal case, but what's the catch?
and what happened to your brother from another mother?
if by that, you mean Agent Reynolds,
I severed my ties with the FBI.
I'm no one's lap dog.
your friend's name is Mike Salinger.
parolee, huh?
sure. Give me the number.
Yep. Thanks.
did 3 years for assault.
same bank he was casing.
he just got out 18 days ago.
Hey, where you goin'? I feel used.
you mean "dirty.
have a nice life. - You have a nice smile.
how would you know? - I'm lookin' at it.
trust me, this has nothing to do with your deafness.
deafness, right?
deafness. Handicap.
it's ok. I'm used to it.
it's just that Dr. Lightman is...
he's complicated.
nothing suspicious at the bank.
you sure about that?
where have you been?
this is a 70% science at best, Torres.
what's he up to in there, then?
interviewing grad students.
Really? To replace him?
he's not the most patient of, um...
look, I would be lying to you if I didn't tell you what it's like to actually work for him.
Mike Salinger. Family man, homeowner, electrician.
he did 3 years for assault.
Yeah, he got out 18 days ago. Tell me something I don't know.
is he interviewing for friends?
you'll be miserable. He'll drive you crazy.
he has no respect for your time, much less any sort of life that you may have outside of this place.
Oh, and make no mistake. Most of what constitutes that work will involve nothing more than fool's errands.
you should stop worrying about me and worry more about yourself.
you can read lips.
what's he saying about me?
he was released 3 months ago, Salinger's cellmate.
Miller was the only one caught 8 years ago when this armored-car driver ended up a paraplegic for life.
we need to get the police involved in is now.
I'm all over that one, love.
so he only did 8 years?
what was he, model prisoner or something?
I'm waiting for the prison authorities or whoever wrote his psych report to get back to me on that.
well, while you're waiting, I'll find Salinger and Miller through their parole officers.
wait! Wait. This Miller guy is clearly very dangerous.
Oh, well, odds are, you know, they're still cellmates on the outside.
Hi.
mine's a scotch, neat.
how'd you find me? - Magic.
I got something you want, but it's gonna cost you.
Oh, you're the limey he told me about.
how'd you make him in the bank?
well, the real question is how didn't I make him?
hold him.
you don't look like a bank employee.
ex-employee. Didn't he tell you that bit?
what are you selling? - Oh, now he's buyin'.
is this how you normally do business?
Oh, that's charming, that is.
I've got the schematics to the bank.
I got the combination to the vault, all right?
I'm here to do business. - What's in it for you?
well, besides the money, it's personal between me and the bank.
What'd they do to you? - They downsized, all right?
I put in 15 years in that place makin' other people money, and that--this is how they paid me back? I beg to differ.
who was your boss?
it's a plonker named Ronnie Hart.
got a number? - His home number.
do me a favor.
hold that.
8 years in prison, you think they don't teach us anything in there?
Mr. Hart, sorry to disturb you tonight.
need to find some information on someone applying for a job.
Yes. Well, unfortunately...
I got a feelin' this is gonna be your last.
well, up yours, then.
downsized?
you were fired.
did he say what for? - Yeah. He didn't trust you.
you're gonna give me the blueprints and the bank combination.
what, you think I'm stupid enough to bring 'em with me, do you?
I know, for your sake, you better have somebody get over here to drop it off.
thought so.
49th and Blane, 30 minutes.
Yeah.
OK.
in your psychiatric report on Mr. Miller for his parole hearing 6 months ago, you gave him a clean bill of health.
I've worked in prisons.
a clean bill of health? Really?
doctor?
Henry Allen Miller had come a long way.
so you wrote, uh-- here it is.
that he has dedicated himself to the concept of rehabilitation and shows no signs that indicate any remaining recidivistic tendencies.
what does that mean?
Miller paid his debt to society, Dr. Foster.
your use of the phrase,"concept of rehabilitation
suggests to me that there may have been some doubt as to whether prison had actually done that for Mr. Miller.
prison on its own didn't help Mr. Miller.
right. Therapy helps, so much so that he doesn't need it anymore.
I didn't say that. - I know. That's my point.
why not?
Henry Allen Miller, your former patient, is a suspect in another potential armed robbery.
need I say more?
all right. This is it.
last known address.
dead end.
another fool's errand.
for a start, Lightman did not tell us to come here.
it's called initiative.
Oh, you're gonna explain initiative to me?
can stay here and be my lookout if you prefer.
Aw, you just wanna be like him.
any chance you get to cut a corner or break a rule or a law, and you just expect the rest of us to follow behind you and clean up after you.
Wow. All that from one therapy session?
you broke into my personal calendar.
you might wanna ask your shrink why you made it so easy for me to find.
seems like I'm not the only one out for revenge here.
all I care about's what's in the vault.
so how we gonna do this, then? We split the job 4 ways, do we you two and me and my partner?
all right, no, I-- no, I get it.
so there's more of you. Say no more.
cause I don't need to know, even if you wanted to tell me. It's
what is it, 3 more? 4?
you talk too much. Anybody ever tell you that before?
Yeah, once or twice.
I'll be back.
49th and Blane it'll take me no more than 10 minutes.
so...
it's a 6-man heist job, then?
I can't see you need that much muscle.
you keep pushing, you keep talkin' about the split, and leavin' here with your life is gonna be payment enough.
you got any more food?
I could eat a horse.
jerk.
be your lookout? What do you think I am?
more to the point, what do you think you are?
what would you have done if that hadn't have been me?
Ah, but it was you.
Oh, grow up.
I wrote the report on Henry Allen Miller when I was in my first trimester, if that's what you're checking for.
did he know you were pregnant?
he threatened you, didn't he?
seriously, right?
how does a guy like you partner up with a bloke like that, eh?
or how does a man like you survive on the inside, eh?
you don't know anything about me.
you owe him, don't you?
you owe him your life.
shut up and eat your food.
now you're using him as a weapon against that bank, right?
you got any salt?
it's his eyes.
it sounds crazy, I know.
but he--he has these eyes that look right through you.
your fear of him sounds natural, considering his history of violence, but the fact remains you falsified his psychiatric report.
you let him loose, doctor, when you believed he could be a psychopath.
blueprints, but no vault combination.
you wanna live, I want that combination.
well, it's in here, all right?
so you're gonna have to keep me alive, all right?
otherwise, it's back to plan "A" for you.
you can shoot your way into that bank. And good luck with that, by the way.
I told you.
I don't have anything to do with him anymore.
we found this at your old house next to his sleeping bag.
what is this?
I came here because I was told he might be in trouble.
it's your number.
he keep in touch with you?
your ex is a suspect in a plot to rob a bank in Silver Spring.
district bank?
that's anger. - I beg your pardon?
at the bank or your ex?
or both?
anger's normal, but if I saw contempt,
I'd be more convinced you were done with him.
he wrote me letters.
still angry, so not exactly love letters.
to make friends with her and her husband.
Mr. and Mrs. Agro.
John Agro's the guard at the bank.
your ex is putting a heist together.
no. That wasn't Mike.
he needed me to get him a list of names.
3 years ago, the bank raised the interest rates on our mortgage for no reason.
we had no savings.
Mike called 'em, but all he could ever get was a computer message.
so one day, he took an hour off work, which we could barely afford, and he went down there just to talk to a human being.
looking for one of the names.
they gave him the runaround, so he just snapped.
he lost his temper.
and attacked someone at the bank.
after that, we were finished.
no income. We ended up gettin' the house foreclosed on.
Mike's never gonna let this go.
no distractions. No histrionics.
you stay with him until I reach the teller window.
he'll take care of the cameras and the lights.
me and the others will control the situation while you open the safe.
I need a gun.
you need to shut up.
he told you to kill me once the vault's open, didn't he?
walk away while you still can.
Oh, he gets about a bit, doesn't he?
3 to go.
how do you know that?
I talk too much. Remember?
look. Look at him.
he sticks out like a tart in a nunnery.
think the teller's already spotted him.
you stay with me.
there's the door. - Use it.
this is gonna get nasty. You know that, don't you?
you're well out of your league.
excuse me, Miss.
sorry about that.
there's 3 in the bank, and there's 3 more on the way.
all kicks off when Miller gets to the window, so...
offer me some paperwork, as though I'm going to open an account.
not that I would ever open one here again.
your people tracked down Salinger's ex-wife. You ready for this?
what was the name of that, uh, mortgage moron you're after?
you don't even know, do you?
who was that you were just talking to over there?
new accounts. I've been trying to get in her pants for months.
never say never.
oi. 10 feet between you and the rest of your life.
who are you?
you spent the last 3 years blaming someone else for your life falling apart, and what happens when you find him?
you want your son to have his dad back someday, don't you?
I'll meet you at the diner.
I'll even buy you breakfast.
last chance.
he'll hunt me down for the rest of his life.
don't blow it now, all right? Don't blow it now.
the cop made him.
"no distractions. No histrionics."Your words, right?
you got the time on you, mate?
he's with me.
we're opening an account with that nice lady over there.
now, we understand each other?
good. All right, stop looking at her now. Look at me.
her life depends on it.
do they give you lot business cards?
all right, I want you to hand me one with the hand that's on your gun right now.
OK, now tell me to have a nice day and be on your way.
you have a good day, sir.
thank you, officer.
I told him there was a robbery in progress and he was too young to die.
no, um, I said I was having trouble with my neighbors, you know, domestic violence and that.
what, you don't believe me?
walk out that door. Go on.
everyone on the ground!
Facedown!
get down! Stay down! Move! Move!
get down!
you move when I move.
move!
get 'em. Heads down! Heads down!
up! Up! Move! Move!
keep goin'! 2 minutes!
I'll get a third, right?
who's in charge of home loans?
home loans? What the hell's he talking about?
that's what he came for, or didn't he tell you that bit?
who's in charge?
is it you?
are you in charge of home loans, lady?
is that you? Huh?
that's not helping.
really, it's not helping.
3 years ago, you made a mistake.
and then when I came in here to try to talk to you, just to try to straighten it out,
I was treated like a second-class citizen. I was given the runaround.
we're in!
freeze. Don't say a word.
Yep. 'Fraid so.
how does it feel to be on the othere end of this?
cause I'll tell you I been waitin' for this moment a long time.
you like it?
how does it feel?!
put the weapon down, Salinger, now!
get down! Get down on the ground!
comin' in.
bloody hell.
there's a lot of guns in here.
how you doin'? You all right?
Oh, I'm good.
right, love?
you should have walked away while you had the chance, mate.
put the gun down.
well, someone's gonna die today...
3 years ago, someone in the Mortgage Department screwed up and put this man's life in the toilet.
or so he thought.
he snapped, and he kicks the crap out of one of your work mates.
now, if I was the person who screwed up like that,
I'd never be able to forget it.
it's not her. That's not the face of someone who's burying that kind of memory.
put the gun down, and I'll tell you who you're looking for.
I'll give you 3 seconds.
I'm looking at him right now.
get down. Get down.
hands behind your back.
he doesn't move!
that person left the bank over 2 years ago.
no, that person's you.
all right? That's why you didn't want the cops involved, right?
cause you recognized him.
get him up.
you just helped us pull 6 wanted bank robbers into a honey trap.
cheers for that, mate.
now you're goin' back to jail, you bloody idiot.
how do you feel about that, eh?
Mrs. Salinger?
I want to start by saying what I should have said 3 years ago.
well, come on, then. Say it.
what happened to you and your family should never have happened.
it was an honest mistake.
Yes, the interest-rate hike was in error, but I really don't think that I can be held accountable for your husband resorting to violence and--and nearly killing one of our bank employees in the process。 Why didn't you say anything about the mistake you made when you made it, Mr. Baxter?
or when the bank employee that my husband attacked was on life support?
say it.
I was a coward.
I am a coward.
the Lightman Group was built on my sweat.
I don't see anyone else's name on the door, nor on my book jacket, for that matter.
the one you haven't written?
you mess with my finances again, you and I are through.
now, you're the language expert. Can you tell me, do I mean that?
I, um--I wanted to say thank you.
he admitted his mistake...
says the reimbursed interest should cover the debt.
don't ask me how it works, love.
Dr. Lightman. - We were told to wait here.
well, whoever told you that misspoke.
or you misheard.
I'm sorry? - No, you're not sorry.
you're confused, Herbert.
no, wait.
outside.
door!
whatever he told you, all right, I'm not your dad.
good. Uh, I see you've met your new help.
help? - Grad students.
social psychology and behavioral science.
Charles from Berkeley and Sarah from Princeton.
never heard of it.
it's in New Jersey.
look, calm down, all right?
no need to yell. - Excuse me?
look at me.
there's no need to yell!
and I was talking about your face, by the way.
you're hired.
nice haircut. - Thanks. I got it just - Not interested. - Told you.
told him what, Torres?
what you think of me. You wanna know what I think of you?
started therapy, have we?
had a little bit of a breakthrough recently?
you told him.
hold on. It's not therapy.
so if it's not a shrink you've been nippin' off to see in business hours, I might add, what is it?
I don't have to tell you that.
I think you're on the hunt for a new job.
well, wonderful.
let me know when you need a reference.
in the meantime...
you said 8: 00.
Hello?
detective Wallowski. mother superior.
I know who you are, Detective.
so now you've met the new help.
group hug? Too early?
Oh, bollocks!
dad, what's going on?
beans on toast, love.
at 4 A. M?
best time of day.
not bad on the beans, but more like beans on crisp.
Yeah. Well, I got a little distracted, didn't I?
a video of golden eagles dragging goats off a mountain.
it's brilliant.
only happens in this one little tiny part of Spain.
how's the book coming along?
let's have another whack at the toast, then, shall we?
have you even... have you even tried writing anything?
just a sentence, any sentence.
that's what I do when I can't write a paper.
you can go back to bed now, love, if you want.
happy families are all alike.
however, every unhappy family...
bored.
no, it's very Russian.
you think you can do better?
let there be Lightman .
hire a ghost writer.
good night, love.
take them away. Don't need them.
all the research I need is in here.
perfect. Deaf as a post.
it's just deaf.
no post.
follow me.
is Loker in?
Yeah, he's somewhere. He should be back in a minute.
sit.
stay.
the red dot test.
watch.
Oi!
you sent Mutt and Jeff to spy on me, didn't you? Hey?
Cal Lightman, Candice McCallister.
Oh, so you don't deny that?
Sarah and Charles are here to help you, Cal.
do you two need a minute?
you know, I am having a hard time writing this book. Same thing happened on the first one.
you know, the one that this whole place is built on.
Dr. Lightman, may I say what a huge fan I am of that book.
is it Candice with an "i" or Candace with an "a"?
cause Candace with an "a" I find to be far more classy.
you know what I mean?
we're running late.
what can I do for you?
um, I thought you said Dr. Lightman was...
busy. That's exactly what I said.
goodbye, Cal.
Oi!
come in here. Make yourself useful.
with your book?
what book?
I need to see Foster's calendar.
you mean hack into her computer.
your words, not mine.
Dr. Lightman, I can't just hack into her...
or you're fired.
watch my fingers.
it wasn't that hard, was it?
on your way, then.
Wh...
what...
did... did you do this?
Hey. This is my desk.
I can't hear you.
the red dot test. He's got you doing the red dot test?
can you leave me alone now?
excuse me?
I need to focus.
no, don't worry about me.
I didn't want anything from the coffee cart.
Oh, Megan!
your dress!
it's all right, mom.
you can't see it anywhere. Relax.
help you, sir?
you lost?
contestants and parents only here.
I must have wandered through the wrong door.
well, how about you wander back out again?
dad, you made my braid crooked.
I'd jump right on that if I were you.
how many time have I told you, Megan, food is not your friend?
I'm calling security.
I work with the pageant.
yeah? Doing what?
this and that.
Yeah, thought so. You're out of here.
wouldn't you rather be a soccer mum?
drs. Foster and Lightman are here to vet our finalists, to make sure we are plastic surgery and drug-free.
lucky for you
I got writer's block.
so you got into my calendar. Good for you.
but I've got this covered, Cal.
who's the favorite in this little Freak Show, then?
freak Show?
and you wonder why I kept you out of this.
what about you?
eh?
you the favorite?
she is one, yes, but nothing is certain.
well, one thing's for certain.
it's all gonna go horribly wrong for someone.
the girl needs help.
and I mean yesterday.
Dr. Lightman, you already called this a Freak Show.
correct.
are you sure your prejudices aren't informing what you're seeing?
everything this girl does is deliberate.
put it this way...
I hope I'm wrong.
these girls are under a great deal of pressure.
don't misread that for something it's not.
when you hear hooves...
think horses, not zebras.
either way, it's a stampede.
what are you doing in here?
you hiding? - Job hunting.
impressive. On Lightman's laptop which you took from his office.
guess what the first line of Lightman's book is.
he takes your desk away and this is how you deal with it.
let there be Lightman .
I mean, he is certifiable.
you don't even have the guts to do this in his office.
you slink away, you hide in here with his computer.
poetic justice.
you mean pathetic justice.
all right, come on, Megan, how many times have we been through this?
hold that extension...
and now sell the smile, sell the smile, really sell it.
Mrs. Cross, Megan.
this is Dr. Cal Lightman.
I'm here for the pre-interview.
new procedure before the finals, after some other pageants had some troubles.
she's going to have to do a lot better than that.
mom, can I take a break?
no. Come on. It's good practice.
just hold it...
could you go out of your way to make her miserable?
excuse me?
here's another one.
does she try to look like you, or do you try to look like her?
come on, Megan, let's go.
Mrs. Cross, we specialize in reading people's emotions.
well, then I don't need to tell you how angry I am.
and scared.
don't forget that part.
you just attacked my mother. How is she supposed to feel?
you ever think about ending it all?
what?
of course not.
your face just said yes, love.
you know, you got a big mouth.
Yep.
she's hiding something on her shoulder.
what? You keep your hands off of my daughter.
my hands aren't on your daughter.
but someone's have been.
haven't they, love?
Oh, my God. Megan.
who did it, love?
eh?
who was it, love?
it was him.
it was Mr. Fletcher.
Laura, no.
he touched me.
Megan, no.
he molested me.
no, Megan, don't.
Megan, I...
look, you all know me. There's no way I could ever...
Laura. Megan, please, you gotta tell them the truth.
you just rang a bell you can't unring.
you know that, Megan, right?
Megan...
you called the wrong number.
you need to call Child Protective Services.
no, what I need is a dodgy cop, who'll keep this off the record till I say.
Yeah, when is that fool showing up?
I do need this one. A man's life just got flushed down the crapper.
maybe he's got it coming. Thought of that?
you been drinking, Detective?
it's called mouthwash, Professor.
am I under arrest?
the girl said you molested her.
kids lie.
which one? Be more specific.
Megan. Megan Cross.
all right, say that name again, without squinting.
do you wear contacts?
Yeah.
he wears contacts. See? His contacts are dry.
what, with outrage? Do me a favor.
Mr. Fletcher, if there's anything you're not telling us about this, you'll make it a lot easier on yourself if you just come clean.
bloody hell.
you people really do talk like that.
who? Latinos or Poles?
Oh, you mean cops.
did you push her?
did you shove her?
did you hit her? Did you, you know, hold her down?
a little bit of everything, really.
if you want to know about Megan, talk to her mother.
well, he didn't molest that girl.
you want to walk me through your thinking on that?
in a word, no.
how sure are you?
you can go, Mr. Fletcher.
answer your question?
I'm not letting the pageant go down.
neither is the magazine.
all right. Uh, don't let him leave, all right? He's hiding something.
so is Megan, by the way.
I can't guarantee his safety.
Oh, don't be such a girl.
tell them to get a life.
I beg your pardon?
the magazine people.
is it helpful in what you do to be so prejudiced?
look, I come here and I spotted a girl who feels the same way about your pageant as I do, so, I would say, yes, in this case it is helpful.
what was that about?
Candice with an "i," not an "a." I knew it.
let's go tag-team them up.
forgive me, but if a man touched a child of mine, particularly in a sexual way...
you heard my mom. We're not filing charges.
did Thomas admit anything?
no.
then it's his word against ours.
if you don't mind my saying, Megan, you seem very calm and composed.
he just groped me, OK?
no, it's not OK.
you're 16 years old.
it's just a bruise.
we're fine.
we?
all right, Megan, one more time.
every look, every word is in lock-step.
they're a perfect symbiosis.
Yeah, except she's dying to get away from her mum.
Laura even uses the royal we.
there's no separation of mother and daughter.
I've never seen two people so on the same page.
let's tear the page in half.
I can see why you're the favorite.
I thought we were done here.
Mrs. Cross, if Megan is a victim of molestation, you need to deal with that.
we don't dwell on the negative.
it shows through to other people.
like the judges.
we've been preparing for this pageant for years.
if this were the Olympics, no one would question her desire to keep her head in the game.
your daughter has suffered a trauma.
she needs to talk about it so that she can regain control.
stealing?
Yeah, it tastes better that way.
you let Mr. Fletcher go.
Yep. Lack of evidence.
interesting.
you don't seem too bothered by that.
I can't afford to let it.
let it what? Ruin your chances of being Miss Freak Show cover girl?
God.
you asked for me help.
no, I didn't.
well, at very least, you asked for my full attention.
right before you were pointing a finger at Fletcher.
Megan.
mommy's calling.
rehearsal.
sorry to interrupt.
you said to let you know when they got here?
has Loker been in here?
Loker?
Yeah. When I was out.
cause, you know...
I can smell him.
he calls it eau du toilette.
French.
French.
one way of putting it, I suppose.
one of my pens is missing.
Hello, gents.
they said we had to come here or I was out of the competition.
Megan, have you told your mum yet?
told me what?
that's all right. No need. It can wait.
you... with me.
you... you're with the delightful Dr. Foster.
it was the, uh, the end of the first day of the competition.
Mr. Fletcher has this... RV.
and you were inside his RV?
Yeah.
it's pretty big.
and, uh, you know, we hang out there sometimes during competitions.
we got to know him and Deedee pretty well.
so it wouldn't have been unusual for you and Mr. Fletcher to be alone together?
not really, no.
when it happened, I, uh... yeah, he could see that I'd been upset, you know, that I'd been crying.
and, uh...
so when was this, Megan?
day before yesterday.
and, uh...
you know, I messed up my personal interview.
and Mr. Fletcher said that, you know, it wasn't fair.
he was... he was comforting me, you know?
and then...
then he put his hand...
on my neck.
and I just thought he was being nice.
she didn't come to you?
no. I had no idea.
and then...
Megan...
you have nothing to be ashamed of.
it's important that you know that.
take your time.
and then he touched me.
he molested me.
I tried to push him away, but...
that's enough. I'm not going to watch my little girl in pain anymore.
tell yourself what you like, love.
but that in there, that's not pain.
that's... that's not even close there.
she's enjoying herself.
is that how you got the bruises?
Yeah.
and then I kicked him and broke free.
she's getting off on your pain.
first Fletcher, now her mother.
she's a sadist.
she's a bloody emotional vampire.
the case still remains,
Fletcher did do something to her in that RV.
we need to involve the police, the real ones.
spoilsport.
Dr. Lightman.
my pageant's about to go up in flames.
down in flames, up in smoke.
two more girls just came forward.
they both say Thomas Fletcher touched them inappropriately.
right.
you call this off the record, do you?
we have 24 hours, and then we have to do the paperwork.
right?
what's all this?
Deedee, can you step over here, please?
for what?
do as she says, love.
we're taking her into custody. Social Services.
like hell you are.
guys.
Hey, back off. Wait!
get off me! - Dad!
dad! - Deedee!
dad! - I'm gonna help him, love.
daddy! - Son of a bitch.
just until we get this cleared up.
dad!
get...
where are you taking her?
somewhere safe, I promise you that.
don't take my...
I'm innocent.
you know I'm innocent.
Deedee!
Oh, my God...
two more girls came forward.
I gotta talk to Laura.
Oh, now he tells me.
tell you what?
OK, look, we used to be more than just friends.
and so now you think she's gonna want to help you out, eh, all of a sudden?
these are memories from the road, then?
Yeah. After my wife died, I sold the house.
too much history.
anyway, this thing's pretty handy when it comes to the pageant.
Yeah, and for a bit of the other, when the girls are off lying about world peace.
you mean Laura and me.
there's no crime in being lonely.
well, Megan would beg to differ.
wait a minute.
Megan came by the other day.
I didn't think anything of it at the time. I didn't think...
did she come on to you?
I turned her down.
I tried to be nice about it.
she went crazy. She grabbed a pair of scissors sitting here, she came at me and I grabbed her,
I wrestled t out of her hands and... oh...
that's how she got the bruises?
still, Megan's getting what she wants. Eh?
your pain.
are you really going to take Ashley out of the pageant?
are you more worried about the girls who've come forward or about your pageant?
Oh, wait, wait.
Fletcher! My daughter, Fletcher?
they're making it up.
all of them?
one thing I know for sure...
Candice...
is that abusers of the kind that we're talking about here, lack that kind of self-control.
uh, we finished the red dot test, Dr. Lightman.
Loker actually told us what it was.
you did it, too, did you?
Yeah.
that's keen.
Yeah. 10 hours long.
2 dots, 10 hours.
actually, there were 3.
right.
excellent. Congratulations.
how many dots were there?
I don't know. I've never finished it.
then what was the point?
each dot represents a micro-expression.
what did she just say?
hilarious.
could you take Mr. Fletcher to my office and make sure he gets some rest.
this is a local pageant from last year.
see how she smiles?
even though she lost.
the winners cry and the losers smile.
losers want to appear gracious, winners want to...
is that it?
no.
no. You need to see this.
I wonder how long she practiced that dive.
triumph at losing.
you don't see that every day.
do you know how to create a disturbed personality?
constant criticism and lack of affection.
works like a charm, that does.
you mean like how you treat Loker?
who?
this chair taken?
you didn't say he was coming.
if you thought that was bad, wait till you see this.
wait for what?
Megan?
look, I just want to talk for a second, ok?
she has nothing to say to you.
they took Deedee, and if you don't tell the truth,
I may never get her back.
you do see what I'm talking about, don't you?
I don't see anything.
what are you two talking about?
to be honest, this isn't the way, Dr. Lightman.
is he trying to get you to disqualify us from the pageant?
us?
you are trying to disqualify us.
your daughter's feeding off your pain,
Mrs. Cross.
do you ever wonder why he just went cold on you?
Megan knows why I stopped calling, Laura, don't you, Megan?
Megan is a victim here.
you're blaming the victim?
I'm the one with all the bruises.
pain is your daughter's drug of choice.
isn't that right, Megan?
Mr. Fletcher here, his pain's like crack to you.
good news... he can get away from her.
bad news... you can't.
enjoy the Freak Show.
he touched my hair and the back of my neck, like he was comforting me.
at first I thought he was being friendly.
then I felt sick.
my hands went numb.
I couldn't catch my breath.
thank you, Ashley.
can you give us a minute?
she said the exact same thing as the first girl.
word for word.
there are also unmistakable language similarities to Megan.
Wallowski.
for how long?
now what?
Megan's missing.
she went for a walk and never came back.
Where's Megan?!
tell your friend in there he's a coward!
Oh, what, like men who hide behind their wives, you mean?
you took away my desk, so here I am.
Where's my pen?
your pen?
Yeah, the one you stole off my desk. My pen.
are you kidding me?
rumor travels fast.
your point being?
one of these people or one of their daughters has got to know where Megan is.
have you thought of that?
what?
what?
I thought I saw a look there.
Hey. Fletcher, police.
come out of there, bastard.
Dr. Lightman, it just came over the radio.
his daughter Deedee's in intensive care, hurt bad.
I'm taking him to the hospital now.
what happened to her?
I don't know. It could be self-inflicted.
don't quote me on that.
pen.
thief.
now, then, Megan.
Where's Deedee?
what, you're disappointed, are you?
you're the face reader.
is this how it happened with Fletcher?
come on, Dr. Lightman, you're the one that lured me here.
you wrecked Fletcher's life.
now you're trying to do the same with me, is that it?
I like you better than him. You get me.
open your hand.
do you prefer cutting up or inflicting pain on other people?
hmm?
show me what you got.
let's get you out of here, shall we?
I know what you're trying to do.
I don't need any help.
I got you.
but you can't tell anyone.
you do...
I'll say you attacked me.
hang on a sec.
go on in.
that was just lovely.
tell that to Thomas Fletcher.
Megan!
Deedee brought that to me today.
I found out where Megan kept it hidden.
the other girls told me.
I'm so sorry, honey.
maybe it's not too late to get you back into the finals.
after what they did to you, forget it.
he touched my hair, the back of my neck.
I felt sick. My hands went numb.
I couldn't catch my breath.
sound familiar?
who else knew about this diary?
Ashley and Ellen. And now me.
that explains their similar language.
here's one.
went to see Back to the Future with Joyce.
first in the school to see it.
it's not Megan's diary, it's her mum's.
a lot of dog-eared pages.
she's been getting off on her mum's pain night after night.
it's how she survives between victims.
or pageants. Where she can inflict the most pain on the most people.
and we took all that away from her.
my mum killed herself.
with pills.
you try to make sense of it.
then you just move on.
no one could ever hurt me like she did.
your mum will move on.
Yeah. After a while, she'll move on...
if you take that dive.
it sounds cold, but it's the truth.
your mom really kill herself?
Oh, yeah.
silly Cal, right?
I know about the diary.
now, that's good. Anger.
it means you feel something other than pain.
she could never stand it if I had a hair out of place.
she'd go to bed for days.
there'd be no food.
she wouldn't talk.
no wonder I never met my dad.
look.
if you really want to hurt your mum...
and her bloody pageant...
no one does that stuff better than me.
"Teenstyle" magazine would like to thank all of our participants for making this pageant a special occasion for all of us.
in just a moment, I'll be handed...
she shouldn't even be back here, you know.
well, it's the best I could do, you know, to get her down off the ledge, 'cause, of course, I didn't have a shrink handy.
and now, after all the talent, after all the poise and beauty, we come to the big moment.
who will be Miss "Teenstyle" Magazine?
whose face will grace next month's cover?
our third runner-up and second-place winner is...
miss Oregon, Emily Tunney.
Congratulations.
our first runner-up and second-place winner is...
miss Connecticut,
ladies and gentlemen, Miss Texas is your winner!
Congratulations.
isn't she beautiful?
miss "Teenstyle" Magazine!
beautiful!
Congratulations.
how you doing? You all right?
he touched my hair, the back of my neck.
I felt sick.
where did you get that?
here love.
mom.
I found it in your closet.
she was telling your story, wasn't she?
I'm done with pageants.
well, honey, I know this hurts right now.
Oi!
will you knock it off.
I'm not doing this anymore, mom.
I'm not putting on a fake smile to music I don't even like.
I'm not... I'm not pretending that I want to save the world. I'm...
you can't do this to us.
us?
or me?
I'll see myself out.
Oh, sorry there.
it's a gift from Fletcher.
a grateful soccer mum.
is there anything you want to talk to me about?
what, you mean like... about my dead mother?
if you like.
no, I just... I come in here,
I was looking for someone to play with.
are you sure there's nothing you want to say to me?
look, Anna...
no, we can talk about it anytime, really.
anytime you want, you know?
how about now? You good?
now? Talk about it right now if you want.
come here, ball.
Lightman said you were a big help reading the crowd the other day.
big help?
he actually said that?
look, he wants you out of the lab and onto the street, Eli. That's why he cleaned your desk off.
to do what? He hasn't told me anything.
make it up. Do what he does.
I already applied for a job, at the Pentagon.
Pentagon?
Lightman's former employer?
Yeah.
you're really gonna do this.
if I get the gig, I'm history.
Yeah. Big help.
he actually used those words.
Oi, hey.
Hey.
I'm warming up dinner.
Oh.
whose cat?
what's wrong?
it was a joke...
love.
when people tell a joke, all right, it's polite to laugh.
did you have a bad day?
I spoke ill of your grandmother today.
Really?
Yep.
I've never done that before.
well, I mean, I wouldn't forgive you if you killed yourself, either.
it wasn't her fault, you know.
I mean, she was...
she was an ill woman, you know, she was...
you know...
out to lunch.
Ooh. So...
not her fault.
look at those fingers go, like little hummingbirds...
they are.
what's that, then?
it's, um, a foreword to your book.
Really?
Yeah. You want to hear the first part?
Yeah, go ahead.
uh, it's not easy growing up in a hoe where someone knows your every thought.
or thinks they do.
a lot of pressure, then?
eh?
you don't have to use it.
it's lovely.
then why do you look like you're about to throw up?
well, 'cause now I got a foreword and, you know, no book.
meow?
Yes, please.
I could?
Yeah, ok, Yeah.
2: 30 is actually better for me, so, yeah, ok.
that's a personal call, is it?
uh, can I call you back? Thanks. Bye.
how's the job hunt going? It's a little tougher than you thought, is it, or...
all right, well, carry on. Keep up the good work.
what?
all I was trying to say in there was, you know,
I want him on the street getting a life, not in there getting a latte.
why don't you just tell him that, then?
and spoil all the fun?
do me a favor.
show me it.
this is Juan Ramirez, street name Prince John, of the Nine-Six clique.
push in tighter.
that's, uh, Detective, uh...
what's his name again?
murderous hatred. What happens next?
so what part of you is thinking "I told you so"?
internal Afairs.
they've been watching Wallowski for a while.
apparently it's not uncommon to run surveillance on gang unit cops.
you got this from I .A.?
they came to me with it, because of your relationship with Wallowski, which somehow they know about.
all right, look at her.
she's pissed off.
at her partner.
she tried to stop him.
it could be argued that she did that once the other cops arrived on the scene.
it could also be argued that you thought having a compromised cop in your pocket was a good idea and there was nothing I could do or say to warn you.
this is a message to you from Internal Affairs.
your new friend Wallowski is under the microscope.
and they want me to stay out of it.
you want me to stay out of it.
Dr. Lightman. What do you want?
every cop in the city have passed their fitness test.
police range. Police personnel only.
what's Prince John got on you that makes you want to kill him, eh?
have a nice day.
it's not so much fun killing cardboard, is it?
let me guess. You've seen the video.
Yeah. You want to know how I got it?
I. A. gave me that tape.
now, why would they be watching you, do you think, in your humble opinion?
what you saw on that tape is my partner subduing a suspect.
trying to kill him, more like.
corner kids like Prince John, they keep guns in the wheel Wells of nearby cars.
he was going for a hidden gun.
Oh, so where's the gun now, then, in a police evidence locker somewhere?
you working with I. A. Now?
if I was, you'd be in the cop shop.
answer a simple question what's going on between you and your partner?
what are you hiding?
you know, you do that whole tough guy cop thing really well, but do me a favor--save it for the customers, all right?
look, Prince John, he's a mid-level dealer with the Nine-Sixes.
all right. So if there was a reason to arrest him yesterday, what's he doing on the street today, then?
herman Farr is a good man, period.
what your partner did on that tape is the beginning of the end for both of you.
what do you care? I'm just the cop that you like to squeeze on the street, in the sack, wherever.
in the sack?
that's a bit previous, isn't it?
that beating was personal.
prince John has something on your partner, and you know exactly what it is.
which makes you a target as well.
I can take care of myself, thank you.
give us a go, then.
you know, you do need my help.
you just don't know how to ask for it.，Do you?
all right.
easy, tiger.
I'll drive.
let's make this quick.
check it out. Vigilante Five-O pigs.
it's Prince John, right?
do you know what a prince is where I come from?
what did you say?- No well, that as well.
but I wasn't talking about your sexual preferences.
a prince, where I come from, is a burden on the taxpayer.
settle.
she's been practicing.
beat it, Snow?
what's she gonna find on you if she pats you down, eh? Seriously.
what's she gonna plant on him, you mean?
eight ball with your name on it in this pocket right here.
ask your question. Go on.
what you got on my partner?
I know he's fat.
you see, I think you can do better than that, really.
don't you, Wallowski?
you know the drill.
I mean, we gotta go.
I'll be back. - You be all right?
let's go.
that tune-up that Detective Farr gave you, was personal, right?
so that means either you have unfinished business or Detective Farr's on the take.
or, you've got something he wants.
Tune-up?
Nah.
well, I got it.
option 2. Detective Farr's on the take.
what ，That's not news to you.
you gonna take his word over a decorated cop?
that was no ordinary beating.
Farr wanted to kill him.
which is why the Prince here is on the run.
what, you see me running?
my advice to you...
dust off your sneakers,Princess.
we done?
I need a ride home.
Well，Protect and serve.
this is the serve part.
we found that Wallowski has a number of interesting reactions.
pursed lips and puffed cheeks indicate resignation.
widened eyes show fear.
Oh, yeah?
we're breaking down the videos into micro-expressions.
I'll break you down into micro-expressions in a minute.
put your hand on your heart and tell me you think Wallowski's clean.
what, you mean clean like you?
give us the room.
now, look, I didn't mean that in a bad way.
I know what you meant.
have a seat.
now what, nurse?
you came up on I. A.'s radar the minute you and Wallowski decided to start seeing each other.
that's a business meeting.
I don't have an ax to grind against her, Cal, I really don't.
you just don't trust my judgment where she's concerned, huh?
I don't want to see you get hurt.
Yeah.
right.
it's a little late for that now. - For what?
I'm up to my neck in it， Come on.
prince John. I dropped him off an hour ago.
Dr. Foster，Can I have a word?
this isn't happening.
did he do this? - He didn't say.
does he know who did this?
if he did, we wouldn't be standing here talking about it.
did you ask him?
he's a city cop 20 years.
you asked him. Your worst nightmare he led to you.
in coming.
detective Wallowski, Internal Affairs， Jenkins.
weapon, please, Detective.
or do you want me to arrest you out here?
arrest her for what?
that.
on what evidence?
eyewitness.
so I'm thinking, I distract the guards, and you start digging.
you got a spoon on you?
or you could tell me the truth about Farr.
I'll get you out that way.
look, Farr didn't kill Prince John.
you and I lifted him, an hour later he's back on the street, and that's why he's dead.
you don't believe that.
so I bit my lip.
give me a break.
if one of those gang-bangers thinks you killed Prince John, this is the worst possible place you could be, love.
mind if I speak with my partner now?
I'll get you that spoon.
what took you so long?
she's never gonna rat out her partner.
I mean, you can offer her any deal you like. It's not going to happen.
so that's your science speaking, is it?
you need me.
badly.
this is a department investigation, Dr. Lightman.
do you want to look good for your career, or do you want to get this right and look even better?
if you are gaming me,
I will flush you down the toilet.
you and Wallowski. - Bollocks.
you got an innocent cop sitting in jail with a target on her back.
Wallowski's there because we have an eyewitness murder with no alibi.
you look me in the eye and you tell me you don't have skeletons.
cause you know if I start looking, I'll find them.
what do you want? - Detective Farr.
But，Not here.
at my place. My comfort zone, not yours.
and when you find dirt on that woman, Wallowski, which I know there is?
that woman?
is that your science talking now?
then you'll give her to me, too.
I just saw a boy shot, 95th and Chalmers.
white lady cop threw him out her car, then started shooting.
and you said an officer was involved?
something like that.
works the gangs up here.
I thought I took your desk away.
this is the 911 tape of the eyewitness.
she has an evasive vocal tic.
the throat clearing she did it when shi was making statements about Detective Wallowski.
did you come up with this all by yourself?
and, if you listen to the tape in its entirety...
it was definitely her. I recognized...
she gives unnecessary details.
not answering questions directly.
she's lying.
maybe she's just old.
look, you keep doing that.
and it just gets funnier and funnier.
Where'd you get the 911 tape from, hey?
you're not the only one with police contacts.
what, Loker? - Afraid so.
next time, will you run it by me first?
that throat clearing it's phlegm she's a smoker.
african coffee， Best on the planet.
is that your son in there, Mrs. Phillips?
Oh, lord, no，Grandson.
Louis， He lives with me.
how do you take it?
a splash of milk, 2 sugars，That's me.
where in Africa? - Kenya.
watch that chopper!
you trying to make your grandma deaf?
leave her out of this.
leave her out of what? - You a cop. I can smell.
how old are you, then?
nice ink, that.
that's the Nine-Sixes, is it?
you know, the proud the few. However it goes.
comedian cop.
you just play your game. You don't mind me, all right?
how about over here?
and whoever killed Prince John,
I wouldn't breathe a word about that if I were you.
I don't know nothin' about that.
well, that's smart. You see, you keep your mouth shut, you pick your side in this war carefully,'cause you never know, right?
next time it could be you, couldn't it?
beat it, snow.
I'd get that if I were you.
you never leave home without it, right?
Oh, yeah,'cause I'm that stupid.
keep it. I'm straight.
snow. I'm beginning to like that.
it's growing on me. Very creative, that.
I'm going over to Ronnie's house, grandma.
be home for dinner. It's your favorite.
Ronnie's house, my ass.
here. Merry Christmas.
it's a firing pin.
just so long as he comes home is all.
Yeah.
what was I saying?
the shooting.，Prince John.
Yes. I'm 110% certain it was the Wallowski girl who shot him.
I might be old, but I'm not blind.
you know, there's many different kinds of blindness.
blind is blind.
right, yeah.
well, thanks for your time, Mrs. Phillips.
that's it? What about your coffee?
rain check.
Hi, mate.
Louis, I thought you was on your way to Ronnie's.
you lost?
Oh, look at you. Lovely.
matching ink.
you guys must really like each other.
or something.
not that there's anything wrong with that.
it's ok.
good evening, all.
another day in D. C.Professor.
Whew. Blimey.
well, at least your partner's got an alibi this time.
you know, her being in jail and that.
who was he?
his street name's Stomper.
local pharmaceutical rep for the Nine-Sixes.
who's that one?
who's that one?! Hey?
what's he smiling about, eh?
he's not smiling. - Come on, calm down.
it's not a capital offense, you know.
disperse those clowns.
what, you mean lift 'em, right?
I mean, they know the dead guy.
they're all in the same gang together.
now, listen. How you doing, mate?
who's that one over there?
he's that dangerous, is he?
how does Detective Farr know him?
hit me in the stomach.
back off, man.
is he one of the ones grabbing for power? Is he?
you hit me in the stomach, I'll pay you $50, with a smile.
which one's gonna make you look better?
you're crazy.
look, whoever killed Prince John killed your friend over there，Right?
who was it?
not that lady cop.
thanks for that.
all right, stomach, not face, all right?
did you see that?
you ok? - Oh, no, I'm fine.
you tell your I. A. Friend I want to talk to that one there，All right?
this isn't a gang war. It's more like a gang at war with itself.
and he knows it.
he's part of it, He's even picked sides.
two Nine-Sixes in two days, Suarez.
busy man.
first off, he's not a man, so try boy.
see what I mean?
you Call this science? - Well, it sells books, you know?
ask him why he's so happy his own gang members are dead.
speak.
you got nothin' on me.
the lady cop killed Prince John and set him up.
why are you lying about her?
do you need her out of the way?
you need her where she's easier to get to. Right?
inside.
I'm with you. Killing cops is serious business.
lawyer. - No need.
you're free to go. Get out of here.
hello.
you know him，do you?
I work gangs. He's in a gang.
you seem exceptionally relieved to see him walking out of here a free man.
let me guess，He asked for a lawyer.
you've interviewed him, have you?
a few times, yeah.
always with Wallowski?
I got one for you.
did you tell Wallowski you were on the I. A. payroll when you started doing her?
and why have you kept me waiting out here?
no reason.
you can go now.
I want interrogation tape on him and Wallowski and any other Nine-Sixes.
get out of here.
I would, but I got work to do.
let me ask you something.
is this about catching corrupt cops for you, or is this about saving your friend?
because I still have an eyewitness.
so you were 2 blocks away when you heard the shots.
is that right?
why don't let him tell us where he was.
I was 2 blocks away.
so in this one, Farr is controlling the interrogation.
he's warning Suarez.
and then the next one.
we put you there，We got witnesses.
we know J. T. has a beef with you.
