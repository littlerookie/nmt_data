is what you're gonna do.
that should do it.
these are your names...
Mr. Brown, Mr. White...
Mr. Blonde, Mr. Blue...
Mr. Orange and Mr. Pink.
why am l Mr. Pink? - Because you're a faggot!
why can't we pick our own colors?
no way. No way.
tried it once. lt doesn't work.
you get four guys...
all fightin' over who gets to be Mr. Black.
they don't know each other...
so nobody wants to back down.
no way. l pick.
you're Mr. Pink.
be thankful you're not Mr. Yellow.
but Mr. Brown, that's too close to Mr. Shit.
Mr. Pink sounds like Mr. Pussy.
how about Mr. Purple?
that's sounds good. l'll be Mr. Purple.
you're not Mr. Purple.
some guy on some other job is Mr. Purple.
you're Mr. Pink!
who cares what your name is?
easy for you to say. You're Mr. White.
you have a cool-sounding name.
lf it's no big deal to be Mr. Pink...
you wanna trade?
nobody's tradin' with anybody.
this ain't a goddamn fucking...
city council meeting, you know.
now listen up, Mr. Pink.
there's two ways you can go on this job...
my way or the highway.
what's it gonna be, Mr. Pink?
Jesus Christ, Joe. Fuckin' forget about it.
lt's beneath me.
l'm Mr. Pink. Let's move on.
l'll move on when l feel like it.
do all you guys got the goddamn message?
l'm so goddamn mad hollerin' at you guys...
l can hardly talk.
let's go to work.
let's go over it. Where are you?
l stand outside and guard the door.
l don't let anybody go in or out.
Mr. Brown. - He waits in the car.
l give him the signal, he pulls up in front.
Mr. Blonde and Mr. Blue.
crowd control.
they handle the customers and the employees.
that girl's ass.
sittin' right here on my dick.
myself and Mr. Pink?
you two take the manager...
and make him give you the diamonds.
we're there for those stones, period.
since no display cases are being fucked with...
no alarms should go off.
we're out in two minutes, not one second longer.
what if the manager won't give you the diamonds?
a store like this is insured up the ass.
they're not supposed to give you any resistance whatsoever.
lf you get a customer or an employee...
who thinks he's Charles Bronson...
smash their nose with your gun.
drops him right to the floor.
everyone jumps.
he falls down screaming...
blood squirts out of his nose.
freaks everybody out.
nobody says fuckin' shit after that.
some bitch might talk shit to you.
give her a look like she's next.
watch her shut the fuck up.
lf it's the manager, that's different.
the managers know not to fuck around...
so if he's giving you static...
he probably thinks he's a real cowboy...
so you gotta that bastard in two.
lf he won't tell ya something...
cut off one of his fingers.
the little one.
then tell him his thumb's next.
after that, he'll tell you if he wears ladies underwear.
l'm hungry. Let's get a taco.
fuck.
Jesus.
l'm blind, man. l'm fuckin' blind.
no, you just got blood in your eyes.
ls he dead?
did he die or not?
let's go.
hold it! Get out!
get out of the fuckin' car!
l'm sorry. l'm sorry, Larry.
l can't believe she killed me.
who'd have fucking thought that?
hey...
just cancel that shit right now.
you're hurt.
you're hurt real fuckin' bad.
but you ain't dying.
all this blood's scaring the shit out of me, Larry.
l'm gonna die. l know it.
what the fuck happened?
he slashed the cop's face, cut off his ear...
and was gonna burn him alive.
what? l didn't hear you.
l said...
blonde went crazy.
he slashed the cop's face...
cut off his ear and was gonna burn him alive.
this cop?
he went crazy? Something like that?
worse or better?
Eddie, he was pulling a burn, man.
he was gonna kill the cop and me.
when you guys walked in...
he was gonna kill you and run with the diamonds.
What'd l tell ya?
that sick piece of shit...
was a stone-cold psycho.
you should've asked the cop...
not just killed him.
he talked about what he was gonna do when he was slicing him up.
l don't buy it.
doesn't make sense.
makes perfect fuckin' sense to me.
you didn't see how he acted during the job. We did.
he's right. The ear's hacked off.
let me just say this out loud...
'cause l wanna get this straight.
you're saying that Mr. Blonde...
was gonna kill you...
and then when we got back...
he was gonna kill us...
take the diamonds and scram.
l'm right about that, right?
that's your story?
l swear on my mother's soul...
that's what happened.
the man you killed...
just got released from prison.
he got caught at a company warehouse full of hot items.
he could've fuckin' walked.
all he had to do was say my dad's name...
but he didn't, he kept his mouth shut.
he did his fuckin' time like a man.
he did four years for us.
so, Mr. Orange, you're telling me...
that this good friend of mine who did four years for my father, who, in four years, never made a deal no matter what they offered him...
you're telling me that now that he's free...
and we're making good on our commitment to him...
he's just gonna decide out of the fucking blue...
to rip us off?
why don't you tell me what really happened?
what the hell for?
lt'd just be more bullshit.
this man set us up.
dad, l'm sorry, but l don't know what's happening.
lt's all right. l do.
what are you talking about?
that lump of shit's workin' with the L.A.P.D.
l don't have the slightest fucking idea...
what you're talking about.
Joe...
l don't know what you think you know...
but you're wrong. -Like hell l am.
trust me on this. You've made a mistake.
he's a good kid.
l understand you're super-pissed.
we're all real emotional.
but you're barking up the wrong tree.
l know him. He wouldn't do that.
you don't know jack shit! l do.
the cocksucker tipped off the cops...
and got Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue killed.
Mr. Blue is dead? - Dead as Dillinger.
how do you know all this?
he was the only one l wasn't 100 percent on.
l should have my head examined...
going ahead when l wasn't 100 percent.
that's your proof?
with instinct, you don't need proof.
l ignored it before, but no more.
have you lost your fuckin' mind?
l'm not gonna let you make a terrible mistake.
come on, guys. Nobody wants this.
we're supposed to be fuckin' professionals.
Larry, look...
it's been quite a long time.
a lot of jobs.
there's no need for this, man.
let's just...
put our guns down...
and let's settle this with a fucking conversation.
Joe...
if you kill that man, you die next.
repeat: you kill him, you die next.
Larry, we have been friends.
you respect my dad and l respect you...
but l'll put bullets in you.
you put that fuckin' gun down now.
goddamn you, Joe, don't make me do this.
Larry, you stop pointin' that gun at my dad!
l'm sorry, kid.
looks like we're gonna...
do a little time.
l'm a cop.
Larry...
l'm sorry.
l'm...
so sorry.
l'm a cop.
l'm sorry. l'm sorry.
sorry.
Freeze!
drop the fucking gun, buddy!
now! - Put the gun down!
don't do it! - Drop the gun, man!
if you love me, will change the station, please.
I'm trying.
what happened to that tape we had?
ready. - My God ...
that's better. - Really? Can not find something?
shall I change back?
Wow. Who is that?
what is he doing here?

Damn! - What? What is it, Clark?

I put the spare back in LA, darling.

I do not know, maybe. - Who steals a spare?
I do not know, Summer, all I know is that I put the spare here.

Yes, I could see.
there is a town about eight, nine kilometers in this direction.
as we walk eight, nine kilometers, Clark?
summer, listen ...
the motel where we came is more than 80km beyond.
the city is eight, nine kilometers in this direction.
well, I think we should be with the car? I mean, what if...
summer, baby, we saw a car throughout the day.
if we start to walk and we walk on this road...
and a car comes, he'll see us...
and will to the next town.
I do not know, Clark. - Baby, it's our only option.

he must be laughing now ...
and wondering why your mother is so upset.
God, I hope so.

I'll take a look around, see if I can find something.

Clark.
Clark?
Clark?
Clark?
Clark?
Clark?
Clark?
Clark?
what happened?
see.
see.
wow, wait a minute.
are you kidding me?
we thought we were alone out here.
sorry to disappoint them. Nice to meet you.
you have no idea that it is good to see someone.
well, it's a great "welcome" a stranger.
what are you doing out here? - We had a car accident.
we had a burst tire, the worst I've ever seen.
and we do not have a spare tire.
it is a bold man for driving the desert without a spare tire.
actually I had ... - What is your name, traveler?
Clark Ewald nice to meet you.
Ewald, how to spell?
as is pronounced...
and you are?
Joseph...
how it is pronounced.
well, it's a pleasure to meet you, Joseph.
wow, look at you, are all injured.
well, we had to walk the car far, then...
your baby is well?
Yes.
I think so ...
I hope so.
so what is your story, Joseph?
the old story running out of petrol.
I saw this place on the map and started walking.
I thought I would get some help here.
should not have gone to work is a ghost town.
I see it now. There are holidays I had planned.
no, not for us.
we are across the state to visit my parents.
well, that's cool.
Yes, if we get there.
well, I have to say ...
I would not mind stop in the shade.
it's hotter than a stand hot dog in hell, right?
Yes, clear, will accompany him.
I would offer you a drink or something to eat, but ...
allow me. I always carry a bottle of rum in my purse.
you never know when you will encounter lost to Los Angeles.
this kind of thing happens to you often?
more often than you think.
take my bag, friends.
what?
do not worry about me, friends.
come on, Clark. - I'm going.
is the following ...
I serve it for drinking.
no, I should not. Accept a little water, if any.
a water coming out.
this is good. - Thank you.
you want me to take a look arm. I have some material.
I'm fine, thanks.
well, if you change your mind.
and the baby of you?
I see you still worried.
would you mind if I ...
bright.
it's okay, just relax.
I felt something.
you still have a glow about you. The baby is fine.
well, it's good to know. You hear that, Clark?
I'm sitting right here.
what is your next step, pal?
now know this place dead.
it's a good question.
I think back to the road and expect a car to pass.
I can not believe we walk up here for nothing.
well.
I went up and down this road a few times.
you may have to wait a good time.
if you have a better idea I'd like to hear it.
well, it's too late now ...
the sun will set.
it will be dark before you know it.
but I think in the morning, can go to his car...
take a little gasoline, bring to my'll take the road.
well, there are cars out there maybe we can check them out first.
if gasoline this lot of rust...
then I'm Mary...
and that I'm not.
there is a motel with a gas station 80km back.
Yes, I know, is where we came from.
well, this is the best I have.
Yes, that sounds like a plan.
okay, then.
meanwhile it is better to light a fire.
it's cold in the desert at night.
what do you say, buddy?
let me get firewood?
of course, we do.
okay.
everything will be okay, honey?
Yes, I will survive.
okay.
this wood is good. - Yes
listen...
be frank with me, what are our chances here?
how so?
what are our chances out of here?
of being rescued.
you want the truth? - Yes
I'd say your chances are not large.
well.
I'll talk to my wife that all is well...
and certainly get out of here.
and you do the same, okay?
so will two liars, not?
Yes, I think so.
do not get me wrong, still want to get out of here...
but until things change...
you and I will twist the truth a little.
you do not have to explain to me.
but must respond to Jesus.
what?
I'm just playing with you, dude.
understood. We have to stick together, right?
that's right.
can I keep the secret also if you can.
so that's what we do.
to the grave.
there is only one more thing.
say.
I do not like people putting hands on my wife.
if you do this again you and I have a problem.
Yes, sir, you're the boss.
I was just being nice.
cool, be nice otherwise okay?
I do this.
how are you, princess?
well, considering ...
owner not want to talk too much ...
but her husband just ask me about our chances to get out of here.
Really?
well.
he asked me not to say what I said to him ...
but I think we in the same boat ...
everyone deserves to know what's going on.
why he does not want you tell me?
I do not know, maybe he has found you would panic.
panic?
I think we all need to know the true situation.
what's going on?
why do not you tell me, Clark?
say what, dear?
about his conversation with Joseph just now.
I just ...
I did not want to worry, that's all.
well, now I wonder All conversations, okay?
no secrets.
it seems fair. What you say, Clark? No more secrets.
okay. No secrets.
listen...
know I never lie you.
just do not hide anything from me, Clark.
thanks again the food.
no need to thank.
this will be your first child?
no, we have a son.
well, I have a son...
before Clark. His name is Ben. He has five years.
stepfather, that's cool.
five is a good age ...
not lost to civilization up to five years ...
I still have some spirit. - What do you mean?
your child goes to school? - Yes, of course.
learning to be a man.
how to get a job, working for the man.
got a problem with that? Got a problem with the authorities?
here, a picture of Ben.
it's a smart kid.
and to answer your question, You...
there are only two authorities I know of...
I am one and the other, God...
and have no problem with any of them.
you just do not think that children should be educated...
Clark.
okay, I'm just trying to understand what you are saying.
all right, man. It's okay.
think as a smokescreen.
you put the children schools ...
so they do not know what is actually happening.
they are using their fingers with mathematics and geography...
while the crap is falling over the rest of us.
well.
let me say this, will not always be so...
as long bury our heads in the sand.
it's time to light the fire under the back of some people.
you're a revolutionary.
no, ma'am, I do not. I'm just the messenger.
what is the message?
do not say you should never talk about politics?
Absolutely.
politics and religion.
you're a religious man, Clark?
you are right that I can not try it?
no thanks, I'm sure. - This is the right answer.
here. - Thank you.
well.
is a beautiful night.
I swear, was the longest day.
well, I better get some sleep.
staying up is superficial.
when you are sleeping you dream...
and is when you are dreaming that is when the truth comes.
so where you live, Jo, where are you from?
if you're asking where I put my head...
I'll tell where I can...
but if you ask where I live...
I'll say in my mind.
a man can be king his own mind.
but what is the advantage of being a king in his own mind...
if nobody cares?
Clark!
my Father cares.
I was not talking you specifically.
suppose that, relatively speaking, in the grand scheme of things ...
you and I are useless.
but in your head you are a king, so what big deal.
what is the problem, Clark? You think you're useless?
they do not listen to you? People do not respect him?
people respect me.
if people do not see me what should...
only means that will be the first to be burned...
when I lift in front of them.
you really is a revolutionary.
no.
see, a revolution involves something that is going around.
what I do have a defined beginning and a very definite purpose.
and what you do, Joseph?
what I want.
I'm free as a bird.
anyway, I think the girl want to sleep a little ...
and I suggest you do the same thing ...
have a walk tomorrow soldier.
Yes, you're right.
meanwhile I will "drain my lizard" then I will also rest.
sleep well we see in the morning.
Yes, sleep well.
Wow.
so, what do you think? - About what?
about Joseph, cute.
it's a little crazy but it seems a good guy.
you think?
think. Do not you think?
I do not know.
he seems a bit strange.
he is just a free spirit. - Really?
Yes, a "crazy beautiful" a hippie.
no need to worry ...
they are all "peace and love" baby.
Really? - Sure.
I know many guys like him college.
of course yes.
not so.
now go to sleep.
good night, Clark.
Clark...
what is the problem?
you saw my picture of Benny?
no, the last time I was Joseph when he showed last night.
I returned it!
I know. This is strange.
I have put in my bag, but...
but what?
I do not know, it's weird. I can not find it.
okay, must have lost inside. Let's find.
Joseph, what time we leave?
we? No, no, dear. You will stay here.
what?
it will be very far and it's hot ... - But I do not want to stay here.
he's right.
you need rest, need to take care the baby she is carrying.
I really do not want be left alone.
I mean I'll be safe?
it makes sense, face, can not leave it here.
I need a man to help me.
you are a man, right, Clark?
she comes with us.
it looks like it will anyway.
"she" is right here!
darling, your car is in this direction.
my car is there are eight, nine kilometers in this direction.
it's a long walk for a pregnant lady.
especially someone as beautiful as you.
shall I leave them alone?
you will not leave me here, Clark.
so what do we do?
now, do not be alarmed, but ...
I travel a lot and you can come find very strange types.
I do not know I really do not like guns.
not me, ma'am.
but if we leave it alone, at least can defend itself.
summer, he's right.
okay.
stand up, lady.
now, spread your legs.
Joseph, what are you doing?
I'll teach her how to use the piece.
do you mind? - No.
you are about to shoot a man or will make a salad?
I'm about to shoot a man.
well, then, act as if shoot a man.
arm straight and strong.
that, good.
now, there is no security.
so if something happens, what will not, but if this happens ...
you gun and pull the trigger, okay?
gun and pulls the trigger.
sure.
that's good.
good
now think is not your man...
but it is a bad man truth.
arma...
do not point that thing me.
"bang." The victim falls, end of the game.
justice was done.
I understand.
he's crazy.
listen ...
sorry get it to sound like.
okay. I'll be fine.
Really?
is. I sit here and my brown...
and shoot anyone try to hurt me.
this is my girl.
listen...
we soon we can...
but still be a few hours, so do not worry, okay?
okay.
you're ready, cowboy?
Absolutely.
just do not delay, okay?
do not linger. I promise. If you're lucky will be driving.
it is here, purple pants.
it is a good start.
I love you.
we are just you and me now, Junior.
what was that?
what do you mean?
do you think it is smart to point a loaded gun at someone?
well, it all depends on who is.
well, you pointed a loaded gun for me, smart guy.
what is the problem, Superman? You can not dodge a bullet?
just do not give me another way, okay?
this is bad enough ...
I need you acting strange like I need a hole in the head.
it will be a fun ride.
believe me I'm enjoying more than you.
we can at least try...
once you get to my car and manage the fuel...
which is the distance to yours?
far.
sure. I forgot, Mr. Prince.
you have to stop it, dude.
concentrate your mind what we are doing...
and not how long it will take or how difficult it will be.
it's very hot here.
I should have brought his sandals, dude.
have you noticed how the only people that really sweat ...
and I mean really sweat ...
are the sons of a bitch who can not stop complaining about the heat?
I can not say I've noticed.
I mean, you see a drop of sweat on me, cowboy?
I'm from the city. I'm not used to it.
everything, and I mean everything, is a state of mind, man.
Really?
what about death?
if you do not tidy up this car, we learn.
I know one thing, she comes to us all.
there is no point crying about it ...
and certainly does not make sense cry about it before.
Wow!
what is funny? - You, man.
you are like a box of fortune cookies or something.
not believe it.
you are very close, is restricted. You need to drop a little.
you say that like met me.
I know, boy.
I know him.
you have a job In ...
is very well paid ...
wears a suit and tie, makes you feel important.
but in mid-afternoon on a hot day, you unbutton the top button, right?
his concession to society. Your badge of honor.
undid the top button, I have worked hard today.
you never had a day working hard in your life...
never worked until blood and the sweat run down into the mud...
staining their shoes. - I see a lot of sweat...
the rest of the world is struggling and debating...
fighting, settling and crying...
blood, shit, sperm and tears flying through the air...
knocking on his face. Only you do not see, man. You do not see.
because you sits in his tower ...
where their shutters down to protect him from the pain of the world.
you see, I know. I know you, pilgrim.
because sometimes, you see much when it is buried in the mud...
than when sitting in his office on the 12th floor.
my office actually is on the 12th floor.
you see ... I told him. I know him.
you define your paths. You, hippies.
I will not pretend that I agree with them, but ...
hear what he says, Mr. America. I'm not a hippie.
it's the way I see and the things I say ...
is a reflection of their society, and ideals.
the only truth is here in my mind.
I'm not a hippie, man.
and you can be sure that in my mind, fire up their cities.
about the devil...
you have to know the truth of the scriptures.
our...
how long is with your wife?
why do you ask about my wife?
I'm just trying to talk, trying to be friendly.
are married 18 months ago ...
and six months before marriage.
it has a good set.
a beautiful wife, a baby on the way, a big house...
bet, two cars, not?
Yes, I am very lucky.
I think some people just do not know how lucky you are.
how?
well.
not believe that a real person, Clark.
you know nothing about me.
I know a little.
what are you talking about?
I just know its type, is all.
funny...
at first I called him a hippie, remember?
and you referred me to his sermon of how the world is unfair.
now you're telling me you know my type?
I'm not talking on how to dress...
or the work you have, or people he meets.
I'm talking the man inside.
his soul.
you are totally crazy know that?
I could say the same thing about you.
the only difference is I looked in his mind.
you know nothing about me...
then we cut the crop, okay?
okay...
but the truth appear at the end.
you can not hide forever.
if you do not deal with it the truth will put you on your knees.
Yeah, and he alone, whose heart is pure, I do not know what else ...
you are bothering me with this thing.
this is probably guilty.
this ends with a man.
there is a way back...
just have to know when to take it.
thank you. I'll remember that.
hippie ...
Hello?
Hello?
thousands in the world today are being dominated, influenced, controlled ...
and driven by demons, without actually being possessed by them.
a person can be so overwhelmed and vexed by demons...
is not really different to be possessed by them.
is there anybody there?
devils may cry or cry with voices...
using their lips and tongue.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
use in moderation, dude.
thank God we did.
of course we can. Just a walk in the park.
I hope Summer is well.
she's fine.
but it should be more concerned with their own situation.
what do you mean?
things are not always what they seem.
shame on you, if someone let the bones out of the closet.
what?
everyone has a secret Clark.
I wonder what is yours.
you want to share with me?
you do not know me, man.
okay.
you really did a number about it.
I open the lid of the tank.
you have traveled the path with me this day.
you had the opportunity of confession and repentance and you rejected it.
his only hope now is telling the truth.
but you will not.
no, you will not.
so be it.
his penance awaits.
I'm getting tired of...
Hello?
Hey.
what?
Ben?
Clark.
God!
God! Benny!
God!
what's happening?
Where's Clark?
he will come.
what is this place?
that's where the sinner comes to die.
you did that?
honey, these people did it to themselves.
do not approach me.
how ironic, is not it?
are you afraid of me now.
can not wait her prince...
back to the city and save.
but the thought is at odds with the truth.
what are you talking about?
man you love...
is much more dangerous than you or me.
he sinned.
all he likes will be crushed.
all that love will be punished.
no.
I'm afraid so.
God!
get away.
stay away.
you cried for the weak...
but they chose their own way.
they decide their fate when cheat, steal, lie and fornicate.
when you take a life or steal a purse...
his actions...
their lies weaknesses...
sins.
Clark...
Clark is a good person.
No!
No!
you're a good person.
no.
but it is weak...
and blind.
I promise I'll raise the scales.
I'll shine the light...
the Lord in every crevice.
I light every shadow.
the light will shine in the darkness.
everyone will know the truth finally.
No!
have faith in God, Summer?
do you believe in God?
yes
so if comfort in knowing that everything. What happens here is His will.
and only Him.
look at you.
you are beautiful.
is an angel.
Damn!
Damn!
drugs, Summer! Summer!
summer!
do not worry, are not for you.
this is for you.
no, no!
please!
no need to do this.
No!
yes I do.
I'm just the bearer.
it is my will.
No!
the life grows within you.
innocent of the sins of the father.
it belongs to me, more than you.
it's as if I myself had planted the seed.
no, no, no.
No!
it is my son now.
No! No!
can you feel me?
you can not do that.
no.
it's time to leave dad bravo.
no, no.
no.
you've been betrayed.
and it will take this brand until the end of his days...
not to forget.
now you can scream.
Clark!
Clark!
come!
summer!
here he comes.
summer!
summer!
Clark?
Clark?
summer?
Clark!
honey? Summer?
God!
darling.
it's all right, all right.
bastard!
bastard! What caused it?
I'll kill you!
your unborn child...
belongs to me now.
this is even necessary, man?
as we get out?
you know even use it?
shut up.
Why?
if not I will kill you!
you can not kill me. You can not kill me.
I am not of this world.
you created this monster.
you even asked for it.
welcome to the revolution, man.
there is no revolution, stupid!
we are just you and me now.
there is nothing special about you.
like all the other useless and vagabonds out there...
too busy with his poetry gay to get a job...
or take a damn shower!
now...
you will tell me everything I need to know, Joe......
because it is so the world works.
okay.
want to talk? Let's talk.
Yes, I would love to talk.
who are you?
I'm an angel.
sent to Earth by a just God...
to punish the weak with the flaming sword of vengeance.
this is your day.
it's your turn to be judged.
judged by what?
really want me to say?
great!
I do not know who is speaking. - You know, yeah, man!
Yes, you!
I see in your face.
you feel it.
every hour of every day every time.
when I see your eyes poisoned and no soul, I feel your pain, man!
I feel your pain!
scroll through my veins. - Shut up!
it is my curse.
it's my curse, man!
what are you talking about?
beware of false prophets which come to you in sheep's clothing.
for they are ravening wolves !
what?
stay out of it, Summer. - Clark?
stay out. Take care of it!
Yeah, you can handle it.
please take good care, is not, buddy?
I think not. You do not care about anything.
you are about to discover that there are some things that can not control.
Really? Really?
I think it will be very easy tied with you in that chair!
do not commit more sins, man!
it will only bring more disgrace for yourself!
so I think I will be a fucking bastard, is not it?
now you tell me everything I need to know. As I go from here?
Clark, no. No!
Clark, no. - Let me go!
you can not do that! - Let me go!
here comes the devil.
as I go from here?
as I go from here?
as I go from here?
as I go from here?
you have no idea who I am.
pilgrim, have no idea who I am!
No! No!
what did he do to you?
I just want to go home.
there must be a way out of here.
he must have a car or something.
Clark, you cut his finger!
what happened to you?
I have to go further, Summer.
No!
look at me.
this is our only chance out of here.
okay?
okay.
but deliver us from all evil. Hail Mary, Mother of God, pray for us...
wake up. - Amen
wake up, asshole.
now there is nothing which does not you to leave.
so if you value your life useless tell me what I need to know...
and all this can stop.
why would I want to to stop?
all it has a consequence.
that's why we're here.
welcome to your hell!
as well, is why we are here?
the tire blew!
it was pretty ugly, right?
you did that?
no matter who, or how, or when.
the only thing that matters is that you are here.
here for what?
do not talk to him, Summer. Do not listen.
your husband is not what it seems.
do not talk to her.
do not say a word for it!
he is one of the bad guys!
shut up!
not even Clark?
listen, you and I are talking, you tell me how to get out of here.
I have said all I can.
only you can ask for forgiveness.
only you can get repentance.
but you will not.
with each breath, you add layer upon layer...
sin upon sin.
I could not tell the truth even if he tried!
he told his wife what he found in the car?
shut up!
Damn!
what does he mean?
tell her, Clark.
do not hold back.
what he is talking about, Clark?
I do not know what he's talking about.
now you have two secrets. - Clark!
I do not know!
Damn!
I will not hesitate this time.
you can not kill me, man!
you have no idea than I am able!
I know exactly what you are capable, but can not kill me...
but will not leave.
where is your car?
where is your car?
I'm not joking this time!
all right, man...
you got me.
I'll take it from here...
but I take it a place before.
that's going to be.
take us where?
take us where?
I show you everything.
at the River.
all answers are on river.
then you can kill me.
if what you want. If it is what you want.
I do not know, do not.
okay, I'm in control. Up!
walk.
why took my picture Benny?
do not talk to him, Summer. - Ask him.
you and I have nothing to say each other, then keep walking.
really. You do not like to talk, like, Clark?
have you talked to Benny? - Did what?
sorry about that.
what he is talking about, Clark? What about Ben?
I do not know what he's talking about. We keep moving, please?
how do you know my son?
I know a thing or two about Ben.
I know he has five years and currently Ronson, eight.
what did you say?
he is quite fragile, is not it?
especially now, is not Clark? - Shut your damn mouth!
how do you know Ben?
I know everything about everyone.
so, when someone gets out of line, I can be there.
and I'm watching you long, boy.
keep walking.
what's going on? As he knows Ben?
I do not know I must have said something to him before.
he knows where he studies, Clark.
summer, it's crazy okay?
listen, you and I have to be united now, okay?
let.
it is here, ladies.
what is this?
my God.
you killed all those people?
I have never killed a person in my life.
all these souls did it themselves.
if it makes you feel better, all of them deserved it.
great, has already shown us. Now, as we get out?
I have not shown anything yet.
it's time to give a closer look.
I will not do these games with you.
not a game, Tarzan and Jane.
he said he would help him after show and that's going to be.
can you hold for me down?
of course.
thank you, Jane.
God has made community to live as brothers

dead man walking!
dead man walking!
what is this?
his final resting place.
the final resting place sin.
Clark, where is Ben?
tell her, Clark.
tell where Benny is. - Where is Ben?
now is the time.
finally, open your heart.
open your heart!
Clark, where is Ben?
where is he?
where is Ben?
where is Ben?
where is his stepson, son?
tell me where is Ben! Where is Benny? Tell me where is Ben!
tell me where he is!
it is time to tell the truth?
you will tell the truth, open your heart.
Clark, please!
tell me where he is.
but you will not.
where is Ben? Where is Ben?
it was gone. Summer.
No! - He's gone.
No!
no, you're lying! Lie!
No! This is not happening.
this is the destination the journey of his life, Clark.
this is the consequence everything you've done.
Clark, please.
please, tell me what is happening.
you have sinned...
and this is the return of the misery that launched on the other thousands of times.
what sin? I never did anything!
you do not, but he.
it!
no. No!
no, no, no!
No!
God!
hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee.
blessed art thou among women. Blessed is the fruit of thy womb Jesus.
holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners...
and at the hour of our death, Amen.
it's okay. All right, dear.
he suffered for sins her husband.
it's not for me tell what he did.
just know that all What happens here today...
has the approval of God and only Him.
should you trust in God, sister.
believe in the Almighty.
believe.
give me the gun, Summer.
no.
give me the gun.
who are you?
what?
summer, it's me, baby. What are you doing?
who are you?
what did you do?
I did not do anything, Summer. I do not know who is speaking.
what did you do?
honey, what are you doing?
he says it's his fault. So what did you do?
summer, did nothing.
I know, Clark.
I did nothing.
what did you do?
you do not know me.
my son is dead, Clark!
what did you do?
whatever I say!
I just want to know what you did.
please.
I can not tell you.
I can not, Summer.
just tell me what you did.
tell the truth, Clark.
for the truth shall make you free.
I just want to know.
I know the truth hurts, baby.
but the lies...
lies kill.
just tell me what you did.
I...
I can not.
tell me.
tell me! Tell me!
say what you did!
I can not tell you, Summer.
point and squeeze.
I'm sorry.
I can not tell.
I'm sorry.
No!
No!
No!
our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name.
come to Thy kingdom.
be done Thy will, on earth as in heaven
bread our daily. Give us today.
forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us.
lead us not into temptation. But deliver us from evil.
lead us not into temptation.
Amen
Amen. Amen
what did he do?
it's not for me to say. I can only say it was bad.
and why me?
why am I being punished?
your sin is apathy.
somewhere deep in your soul, you know what it was ...
and yet did nothing.
and so you betrayed us all.
I wish it could come with me.
who are you?
I am the future of the world!
but the world not know it yet.
No!
no.
in every life there is a choice.
a fork in the road.
there is the path of righteousness and the path of sin.
you can walk the path of sin for many days.
you can even start to like it.
until one day you see me, coming your way.
and when you do, you better come back and run.
back to the bifurcation and take the other road.
where are you going, dear?
where you are, dear.
because if we cross paths is too late.
and I'll burn it.
thank you. - Nothing.
filmed DURING GOLDPOINT, NEVADA AND LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA
try not to be scared when you see him, okay?
mom, I've seen him sick.
I'm not scared.
this time's different.
the doctors gave him an extra course of radiati and chemo
I know.
and you understand how proud we are of you, right?
gloves, mask.
you said you wanted to see your brother before the procedure.
I know I look like an alien, but I promise not to eat your brain.
when this is done, will you be able to play out back with me?
I'll rip anything you put near the strike zone.
let your brother rest up while we take some of your marrow.
you don't need to be in an isolation room, but I pulled some strings so you'd be next door to your brother.
how many games will I miss?
well, you only have to be here overnight, but you do have to take it easy for a little bit.
I already missed two. - Matty.
I know. It's okay.
must've been a drag.
we just had to make sure you weren't exposed to any bugs.
because your healthy bone marrow is what's gonna cure your brother's leukemia
maybe it's just an allergy.
not with an enlarged spleen and a fever.
he's got one of 10, 000 possible infections.
even if it's just the common cold,
I do the transplant, he kills his brother.
how long do we have?
radiation obliterated his immune system.
even in a clean room, he's only got.
four, maybe five days left.
no way we can solve this that fast.
you need to find another donor.
they're african-american.
it makes it nearly impossible to find a full match.
tell me about it.
I can't even find the one I've got working for me.
Where's foreman?
nothing like a dead patient to send you back to your choir boy roots.
you're not gonna believe what happened.
Wilson just killed a kid the same way you did.
he's not dead.
five days are gonna fly by.
he didn't look both ways before he nuked.
you done talking to your imaginary friend?
cause I thought maybe you could do your job.
we should start the donor brother on broad spectrum antibiotics.
great idea, if you're looking to save exactly one kid.
broad spec will take at least a week to work.
we need narrow spec.
how old is hector?
our patient's name is matty. His brother's nick.
Hector's my dog.
he's about 17.
17?
that's like.
119 in human years.
why is he still alive?
five days minus 20 seconds talking about wilson's dog.
we need to start testing.
stool samples for parasites, antibody tests
blood panel was negative for all the usual suspects.
that's 'cause the infection is too small.
we start testing now, it's like looking for a needle in a haystack.
we draw blood, odds are we're just gonna come up with hay.
we need to grow more needles.
okay, that probably needs further explanation.
we make the donor kid sicker.
we freeze him, we soak him, break down his immune system.
suddenly we're looking at some needle a camel can pass through the eye of.
making him sicker risks spreading the infection all throughout his body.
true, but who cares?
once we know what the infection is, we'll know exactly how to treat it.
as long as he isn't dead yet, we're cool.
we should do what we normally do
go to the kid's house, check for sources of infection.
waste of time.
you think it's in the house.
I know it's in the patient.
safer than intentionally making the kid sicker.
fine. Go.
so exactly how sickare you gonna make matty?
he could get quite ill.
this certainly won't be a pleasant experience for anyone, but it's our on
ever get caught in the rain without an umbrella?
that's all we're talking about here, sign the form.
it's a little more complicated than that.
we'll also be doing leukopheresis.
we run matty's blood through a machine that filters out his white blood cells.
but without his white cells, how can he get better in time?
we'll pump the white blood cells back as soon as we have a diagnosis.
then we should be able to cure the infection in time to do the transplant.
but you can't guarantee?
we're not gm.
no recalls, no rebates.
any more questions while your son's life slips away?
you really think we should do this?
Yes.
sorry.
you patient. You tell them.
this is your family.
it needs to be your decision.
all you had to do was say,"yes, I do."
God knows that's a phrase you've used often enoughin your life.
it was a mistake every time.
give it a break. They said yes.
that's not enough for you.
you need them to feel good about saying yes.
I treat patients for months, maybe years, not weeks like you.
I'm taller.
if they don't trust me, I can't do my job.
the only value of that trust is you can manipulate them.
you should write greeting cards.
giving parents the chance to make a bad choice was a bad choice.
at least it would've been their choice.
one they'd regret at their son's funeral.
kitchen and bathrooms were immaculate.
whatever the kid's got, he didn't get here.
no, whatever the kid got, he didn't get from the kitchen or the bathroom.
nobody cleans swing sets.
Yeah.
because their kid's ten and hasn't used it since he was six.
you obviously think your time could be better spent.
why'd you come along?
I feel bad about what happened last week.
I'm handling it.
you think the family's gonna sue?
she only had her grandparents and they weren't close.
well, that's good.
for you, I mean.
a lawsuit makes it even harder to put behind you.
you put yours behind you?
no.
when I woke up this morning,
I couldn't remember what she was wearing when I admitted her.
memories fade.
I killed her a week ago and I can't remember what color top she was wearing.
I was grateful when I could wake up not thinking about her.
I'm not like you.
your patient died because you were distracted over the death of your dad.
I made a calculated decision.
you acted like a human being.
I acted like.
it could be mucor or strongyloides in this dirt.
no pulmonary symptoms.
he's setting well, breathing easily.
mom, I'm freezing.
how long do I have to
Matty, we found an old water pump in your backyard.
you ever drink from it?
Yeah, it was gross.
we gotta test for my cobacteria, leptospirosis.
when did you drink the water?
last summer?
you sure?
you haven't even taken a sip to cool off?
it was really gross.
my shoulder's bugging me.
does that matter?
it could.
did you do anything to hurt it?
just threw the ball around the other day.
for a couple of hours.
it's probably just a muscle ache.
let us know if it gets worse.
so soreness and stuff, th's not 'cause I'm sick?
is something else bugging you?
sort of.
he has acute scrotum.
adorable. Please,
I thought you were dignified.
come on, how am I not supposed to make that joke?
the best thing about big honkin' gonads-- well, one of the best things
is there's only a few infections that could cause it.
do urinalysis and cultures for E. Coli, klebsiella, tb and brucella, blood tests for enteroviruses and adenoviruses.
hopefully, the needles have grown as fast as his sack, and we can find it.
can chase and cameron cover that?
mind if I ask why?
I want to recheck the national marrow registry for an alternate donor.
in case we're wrong?
it's been known to happen.
fine. Go.
negative for E. Coli and tb.
why is house taking it easy on foreman?
he deserves a break.
Yeah, house is all about giving breaks to people in need.
no on klebsiella.
and it's tuesday.
it's got nothing to do with foreman or house. It's just
it's the day I remind you I like you, and I want us to be together.
thank you.
I'd forgotten.
no on brucella and both viral antibodies.
you're really gonna do this every tuesday?
you take the day off, I'll pick it upon wednesday.
what if we're looking for the wrong thing?
these are the only infections that cause swollen testicles.
why don't you just say it four times now and leave me alone for a month?
what if it's not an infection?
his temperature's through the roof, there's mucuspouring out of him.
I know he has an infection, but what if it didn't directly cause the scrotum issue?
what if it just.
caused the thing that caused the scrotum issue?
CKMB is elevated.
slightly. There's nothing wrong with
indicates cardiac injury.
we stuck him in that room, put his stupid little runny nose infection into hyper drive.
what if it went to his heart?
pulmonary valve looks clean.
wait.
stop.
mitral valve.
there's a growth.
he'll need a month of antibiotics to clear that.
his brother only has four days to live.
the infection in matty's mitral valve rules him out as a donor.
this is perfect.
we drove the infection into his heart.
okay. Perfect is too strong a word.
but it's very, very good.
now we know where the infection is.
all we gotta do is remove the valve, I.D.
the infection, target and destroy.
remove the valve?
he'll be fine on antibiotics.
he doesn't need open heart surgery.
he'll be heartbroken on account of his dead brother.
either way, he's gota dead brother.
the infection isn't just in the valve.
even with targeted medication, there's no way we can clear his system in time.
we don't have to.
we just have to clear his marrow.
after the surgery, you harvest the marrow, marinate it in the targeted antibiotic, simmer and serve.
it could work.
it's insane.
it is better than a dead brother.
I'm running this by cuddy.
fine. Go.
in fact, let's all go.
this surgery is dangerous and life-altering.
and clearly not in the interest of our patient.
it is if he likes his brother.
we have a conflict of interests. The parents don't.
of course they do.
they already sacrificed matty's health to benefit his brother once.
they made his cold worse.
we screwed up his heart valve by making his cold worse.
do you have anything to add to this debate?
Wilson's right, foreman's wrong, and your shirt is way too revealing for the office.
what do you want me to do?
we should call child services and have them appointa guardian for matty.
no.
go explain the choices to the parents.
and don't let housebully them.
did he really think I was gonna do that? - I didn't.
then why did you let him - tried to cut him some slack.
nice of you.
I think he's got the yips.
steve blass, scott norwood, david duval all got the yips.
great athletes.
lost their confidence, and immediately started sucking.
and you're giving him time to work through it?
four days and then he's fired.
you don't get better from the yips.
open-heart surgery?
if you want both kids to live, it's the only choice.
due to the valve replacement, matty will have to be on blood thinners to prevent potential clots.
for how long? - Forever.
he couldn't participate in contact sports because of the risk of hemorrhage.
what about the marrow registry?
maybe they'll find a match.
maybe they'll ride it here on a unicorn.
I'm afraid finding a viable new donor isn't something we can realistically depend on.
either we cripple one sonor kill the other.
he won't be able to play baseball.
but that doesn't make hima cripple.
what should we do?
you should protect your family as a whole.
you should do the surgery.
that was awesome!
shut up.
I gotta start pretending to care.
I did exactly what cuddy told us not to do.
no, you didn'T. You did exactly what she told me not to do.
you're completely in the clear.
you've gotta be kidding me.
you're actually upset.
you just said what you believed.
I also believe in patients making their own choices.
because it lessens your guilt if things go wrong.
you're not protecting your choices.
you're soothing your conscience.
by that logic, a sociopath would make the best patient advocate in the world.
am I blushing?
you ready?
Thanks.
you'd do the same for me.
don't worry.
you're gonna be fine.
think I'll be better in time to pitch in the playoffs?
maybe next season.
we should have told him.
he loves his brother.
but if he understood what we were asking of him
he loves his brother more than he loves baseball.
you did the right thing.
putting any part of this decision on him
it's impossible for you guys to deal with this.
how's a ten-year-old supposed to do it?
canula in place.
sutures are holding.
we're all set to go.
switch him or to by pass.
I didn't do the surgery.
you woke me up to tell me that you're lazy.
we biopsied a piece before we started cutting.
I'm tired. Get to the point.
we didn't replace the valve because the growth was fibrous tissue.
it wasn't infectious.
we gotta be wrong about
Oh, god.
what?
you know what's wrong with matty?
I think hector's committed suicide.
what are you talking about?
he took some pills.
is he alive?
he ate half my stash.
of course he's
he's stoned.
I'll be right in.
we cut all the way into this kid's heart, and all we got was this lousy, noninfectious fibrous tissue.
how did we miss this?
Matty had a fever.
he got sicker when we suppressed his immune system.
that all points to infection.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
not our fault.
fibrous tissue.
something is turning his healthy heart valve to gristle.
fibrous tissue, enlarged spleen.
Fever--could mean autoimmune.
autoimmune diseases aren't passed along in bone marrow.
he can still donate.
we confirm, I do the surgery.
lupus and bechet's are our best bet.
do an ana and a thergy test.
or it could be infection.
my memory's not what it used to be, but didn't we just rule that out 8 seconds ago?
just because it's not what screwed up his valve doesn't mean it's not in his system.
Uh-huh; and it has the obvious advantage of making us right all along.
a little disadvantage of making big brother dead.
that's your argument?
better outcome?
it fits.
the family has one kid with leukemia and one with autoimmune.
wouldn't stand next to them in a rainstorm.
that's your argument--it sucks for them?
it fits, and we can still help big brother.
national marrow registry came up with a four out of six donor
six out of six is two better than four out of six, right?
I mean, I know two is so small, but since it means that he's gonna get graft versus host disease, the marrow will attack his body and he'll diea painful death.
find out what autoimmuneit is.
is this autoimmune better or worse than a new heart valve?
it depends on which autoimmune it is.
with early detection, most are manageable.
how long will the testing take?
that's the other good thing about this.
there's literally thousands of possible infections but only a handful of autoimmune conditions.
we'll have the answerin a few hours.
Hey, doctor?
is this bad?
wanna catch a movie?
it's 1: 00 in the morning.
I know a place.
although I wouldn't recommend wearing those shoes.
how, exactly, does a dog unscrew a bottle of pills?
is that a riddle?
it requires an opposable thumb.
I must have left it off.
on the floor?
I think he hopped upon the bathroom counter.
he has arthritis.
not me this time.
no, it's your damn dog!
he chews everything!
I was missing a file.
found paper in his stool.
an original sun record 78 elvis recording--gone.
who the hell chews vinyl?
he's vindictive.
and he's had a good, long life.
it's his time.
are you okay?
I just tripped overwilson's self-righteousness.
what do you got?
Matty's negative for everything.
it's not autoimmune.
so we're back to infection.
Nick's starting to deteriorate fast.
he's got bruising all over his arms.
capillaries are leaking blood.
if it happens in his brain, he's dead.
we've got to go with the four out of six donor.
did I mention my concerns about four being less than six?
Wilson's first wife ignored a similar issue.
of course, that time, it was only fatal to their marriage.
it's either that or we start randomly testing matty for infections.
I know you hate the word random.
do it alphabetically.
we're not doing that damn transplant.
Where's foreman?
we found a donor.
it's not an ideal match.
but four out of six still gives nick a chance.
a partial match transplant is extremely dangerous.
Dr. Foreman explained.
he also explain what sort of pain your son will experience - if he gets graft versus host disease? - Yes.
apparently, he didn't explain it vividly enough.
let me give it a whack.
he also explained that if we did nothing, nick could start bleeding into his brain.
Matty is a perfect match.
just give us a little more time to figure out
how much time?
Dr. House is the best diagnostician
how much time?
I don't know.
and nick can start bleeding into this brain without any warning.
Yes, but the chances of complications from a mismatch
my boy shave suffered enough.
get matty better.
and give nick the transplant from the new donor.
foreman screwed us.
No! You screwed us.
what is the point in being able to control people if you won't actually do it?
it's like training a dog and then letting him go on your rug. Which, by the way.
once Foreman got his mitts on them, there was no way
you don't explain chances and probabilities.
you lie to them.
you tell them Foreman's a moron which isn't even much of a lie right now.
you've got to talk to him.
I got no problem with what foreman did.
he undercut us and he may have cost that kid his life!
well, he did what he thought was right.
you, on the other hand, sucked out.
when the decision really mattered, you didn't have the guts to tell them what to do.
if that kid dies, it's because foreman was wrong and because you're a coward.
Oh, goodness!
I've left my door open.
my poor dog must have run away and been hit by a car or truck.
or train.
or an anvil.
thank god.
you're still here.
he's still here!
Where's my stereo?
how you feeling?
a little itchy.
it's weird, huh?
you still have no idea what's wrong with me, but those meds will make me better.
we put you on a variety of medications that'll fight all kinds of infections.
but nick.
you know exactly what's wrong with him, but maybe he's gonna die anyway.
hopefully, the new marrow will
I can't go in there, can I?
your infection would kill him.
so I won't be ableto be with him.
when he dies?
you'll be able to be with him when he gets better.
what's wrong?
it really itches.
Hello?
why am I meeting you here?
you're paying for my new cane.
it was your dog.
so that's it.
you call me a coward, life goes on.
apparently.
you showed up.
I'm sorry.
okay.
you're pathetic. I didn't actually mean that.
Yes, you did. - No, I didn't.
to infinity.
Yes, you did.
you're pathetic.
when?
what did the lab say?
why don't you buy your cane in a medical supply store like a normal cripple?
fewer bitch in' choices.
okay.
what do you got in bitch in'?
right this way.
that was cameron.
the kid that wasn't all that sick is now all that sick.
he's bleeding out of his ears.
blood counts?
down.
Schistocyteson the smear?
his body's not making new blood cells.
his bone marrow's crashing.
this is one of our top sellers.
it's a little too marilyn manson in a retirement home.
meds are suppressing his bone marrow.
or the infection's doing it.
very cooL.
genuine bull penis stretched over a metal rod.
penis canes are murder.
let me see the one on the end.
you got it.
you need to stopmatty's meds.
the marrow rebounds, it's the meds.
if it doesn't, it's an infection.
and if it's the infection?
maybe I was wrong about which kid's gonna die.
bitch in'.
flames.
makes it look like I'm going fast.
now, how's our dying kid?
Nick's developed blisters all over his feet and legs.
he's got grade four graft versus host.
increase his dosage of methylprednisolone.
already did. It's not working.
feeling guilty?
I did the right ing.
always a comfort.
okay, what's the other kid's status?
we're done with nick?
God is done with nick.
we know what he has.
we know how to treat it.
we're doing it. It's not working.
life is for the living.
Matty's been off his meds for a few hours, but his blood count's still tanking.
it means the meds aren't to blame.
it's the infection.
if we don't get this under control, his blood will literally turn into water.
cultures still aren't growing anything.
why not?
because you did the right thing.
convinced the parents to treat the kid.
all you did was yank the weed out of the ground.
it's roots are still killing your beautiful lawn.
we just can't see it.
and if we can't see it, we don't know what it is.
and if we don't know what it is, we can't kill it.
you gotta wait for itto grow back again.
now his soil is arid.
so he and his brother will be dead by the time
what if the dandelion was in fertile soil?
what if we take the roots from matty and put them in nick?
turn the kid into a petri dish?
only better.
a petri dish can't tell you when it hurts.
you want to give him his brother's infection?
the very thing we've been trying to avoid since the brother sneezed?
leukemia kid's got no defenses.
which is why he'll die.
but before he does, the infection will spread, fast.
fast enough to tell us what it is.
in time to save his brother.
do you see any other way?
the infection is decimating matty's bone marrow.
but.
if we give that marrow to nick, his symptoms could let us diagnose matty.
but it'll kill nick.
Yes.
you're-- you're saying we should kill one son to save the other?
Nick is gonna die either way.
you don't know that!
I mean, he's in pain right now, but nick's graft versus host is not responding to medication.
it can change.
may--maybe he'll--he'll rally.
Hey, my nick is a fighter.
graft versus host is not gonna go away because of nick's sunny smile and positive outlook.
Nick has survived three reoccurrences of his leukemia.
he's being torn apart from the inside out.
his pain's gonna get worse and worse until he dies.
you're just dragging it out.
you have only one decision to make to leave here with one dead son or two.
tell them.
you should let us do this.
no.
we're not giving upon nick.
not!
patients' parents apparently don't want to be parents anymore.
you're a sneaky bastard.
any idea show we get around this?
court order?
that's hardly sneaky.
we can still save matty.
run more tests.
find out what infection is destroying his marrow.
10, 000 possible infections.
at least 20 minutes per test.
take you approximately eight years.
actually, four months, assuming the last one I test is the right one.
if it's the first, it'll take me approximately 20 minutes.
he's right.
it's worth a shot.
he's timid.
testing blindly is not gonna save this kid.
but standing around here will.
wow, he sure is hurting.
nurses say he maxed out on his pain meds.
if I had a nickel for every time I heard that.
pharmacy's on the ground floor.
I'm gonna go get you some more pain medication, okay?
thank you.
it's not gonna help.
you're dying.
nothing's gonna change that.
drugs'll just make you go easier.
I know.
14 years on the planet.
most of them spent suffering.
dying before you even got to drive a car, take off a girl's bra, drink a beer.
believe me, there's plenty you haven't done.
really good stuff.
must make it hard to believe in god or fairness and a larger purpose.
but your life doesn't have to be meaningless.
you can save your brother.
how?
negative for cmv.
negative for amoebas.
house called you timid.
he's called me a lot worse.
to him, there is nothing worse.
he's gonna fire you.
even if we runa hundred tests, that only gives us a 1% chance of saving these kids.
better than zero.
you don't care if you get fired?
I don't know, there's got to be a way to better our odds from 99% chance of death.
you gotta know.
it's not food-borne, because no one else in the family is sick.
either you care about your job or you don't.
Matty's the only one who drank from that water pump in the backyard, but we eliminated pseudomonas and cholera.
if you care, you fight to keep it.
if you don't, you quit.
I thought they lived in the suburbs.
they do. Why?
they've got a water pump?
please, I wanna do it.
no, nicky.
it's not your decision.
I'm dying.
there's nothing that's gonna change that.
don't say that, okay?
you can't give up.
it's time for me to go, dad.
you gotta let me go.
no.
please, son.
I can't.
I can't!
let me do it for matty.
let me do it for you guys.
so you won't be alone.
are you sure?
no.
but he is.
get nick back to the clean room.
the parents agreed to infect him.
we figured out what's wrong with matty
histoplasmosis.
well, what is that? I mean, why did it fungal infection.
grows in chicken feces.
the dirt that matty used to build his pitcher's mound must have sat under a chicken coop.
your whole neighborhood was built on top of farmland.
we didn't test for it earlier because we
can you fix him?
full course of amphotericin, and he should be fine.
and nick?
I mean, can you clean matty's marrow, um, just like you were talking about doing it, but do it fast and.
and get it into nick?
I'm sorry.
the reason matty is so sick is because the infection's attacking his marrow.
he doesn't have enough left to safely take from him and give to his brother.
I'm going to get better now?
that's it?
that's it.
and what about nick?
your brother was willing to risk his life to save you.
are you willing to do that for him?
I can't sedate you.
you're too sick.
please, please stop.
please, please.
you're done, right?
sorry.
I need a lot more.
no. Stop!
stop!
how much heat are you taking from the parents?
they're calming down.
I think it has something to do with both their kids being alive, awake, and eating.
the marrow transplant took.
welcome back, foreman.
you should talk to him.
and tell him how proud I am?
Hey, if you're ashamed of him, you can tell him that.
pride and shame only apply to people we have a vested interest in, not employees.
how many hours a day do you have to spend with someone before they're basically family?
good point.
but first, I gotta tell cameron and chase that they're violating god's will.
I'm just asking you to have an adult conversation to let him know he did a good job?
he knows it.
adults don't need adult conversations.
just like I don't need this conversation.
have you killed hector yet?
obviously not.
he's quiet. He's
is that my stethoscope?
bad dog!
listen.
Bonnie joined her home owners association and staged a coup.
pets are now allowed.
if you want to keep him, she wants a new puppy anyway.
she'll understand.
why would I want to keep him?
you're sure.
come on, boy.
ain't No Reason
accidents happen.
candy?
good boy.
good boy.
you did good.
I did what you would have.
well.
maybe I'm biased, but
I tortured the kid.
because you knew it was right.
you knew you were saving his brother.
I know.
I don't like that I know.
I hate that I can listen to a kid screaming in pain and not even take a moment to question whether I'm doing the right thing.
I hate that in order to be like you as a doctor,
I have to be like you as a human being.
I don't want to turn into you.
you're not.
you've been like me since you were eight years old.
you'll save more people than I will.
but I'll settle for killing less.
consider this my two weeks' notice.
trying to remember those blueprints what we lost to the burn
without them, we'll never be able to navigate those pipes beneath the psych ward.
but I need to know where you got that burn right now.
otherwise, your ass is going to solitary.
I put my blood into this
how about you elaborate on that?
how about you stop with all the questions.
you're a glorified bodyguard, that's it.
okay, I got it
put it down, you are not a killer
get out the way
you Know, May be they gave you those things for a reason
Yeah. To keep me in there, the invisible handcuffs
Hello, roomie.
you were right about my tattoo.
it is a path
and I need you to remember when you saw it, haywire.
who are you?
doesn't ring a bell wind back a while in Gen Pop Cell 40?
general Population. Officer Bellick assigned you to my cell
I have a tatoo, you drew it
haywire, do I look even vaguely familiar to you?
are you the guy who stole my tooth-paste?
yes Yes, I stole your tooth paste so you do remeber
candy man
Mr. Potochic
Mr. Scofield
no, thank you
medication is mandatory. Just a mild sedative prescripted by Dr. Tencredi. Come on
can I talk to her directly? I'm feeling better
Oh really? that's great Now take the pill
take them, they are good
I'm fine, thank you
Carter! Can you come here for a sec?
Scofield went J-cat?
it Sure did I saw him come into, I knew he's gonna crack first time I saw.
so he's not coming back here.
doubt it. They got him in the whack shack.
what about sucre?
he's in ad seg. Why?
middle cell, middle tier, prime piece of real estate.
you thinking what I'm thinking?
maybe.
we promise to keep it a single for a couple of months, auction it off.
make it happen.
I don't need medication.
swallow it, or it's going in the rear door.
all gone?
nice.
you were right, haywire.
I did steal your toothpaste, and you drew that tattoo from memory, and I need you to do it again.
middle cell, cool in the summer, warm in the winter.
how much you asking? - How much you got?
got a deal?
deal.
now get your ass out of here and I'll put in the transfer.
Hey, man, the toilet's leaking.
look, it's dripping.
I'll put in a work order. It'll be replaced in 24 hours.
you got it, boss.
I heard you was moving some real estate.
already been moved.
that scofield's cell?
not anymore.
close up 40!
prison Break
that's you daughter?
my wife game me this when she was born.
outliving your wife is bad enough.
outliving your daughter
no man should have to endure that.
how long does she have?
hospital says a week, maybe two.
we got us a problem.
mojo's moving in scofield's cell, and that ain't all.
he's bitching about the toilet, so geary's putting in a work order.
they move that toilet...
they find the hole.
we are all screwed.
how much mojo promise him? - $200.
Oh, gomer, see, you had me scared there for a second.
I hear you got a cell.
not anymore.
and if you were smart, you'd keep quiet about that.
Hey, look, I'll double what you're getting.
I'm getting $250.
$500? Ain't a problem.
I ain't talking cigarettes and extra chow line desserts here.
I'm talking green paper with dead white guys on it.
I said it ain't a problem.
come on.
where?
it's a surprise.
I don't wear a diaper.
I never said you did.
then what are you doing?
you got something in your teeth.
what? - Oh, yeah. Right there.
I don'T. - It's right there in the back.
come on.
why are you doing this?
I am helping you.
remember what you used to call those little pills?
invisible handcuffs.
handcuffs on your mind.
you hate them, remember?
you got a phone call.
who is it? - Your son. It's an emergency.
Oh, L.J.What were you thinking, kid?
I don't care what happens to me anymore, okay?
they won. They'll always win.
I just wanted to take one of them down with me.
put veronica back on.
what are the charges?
attempted murder.
he's also being arraigned for the murder of his mother and his stepfather.
I guess bail's out of the question?
exactly.
anything you can do?
right now, his only shot is if we can get him tried as a minor.
but he needs to show some remorse.
I need to sell to the court that he was just a scared kid.
where his head's at right now, he won't listen to me.
he'll listen to me. I need to see him.
lincoln, there's no way.
he gets tried as an adult, he may as well sit in my lap in the chair.
you got to do something, veronica.
okay, I'll petition the D. O.C, but it's a million-to-one shot they'll let you out to see him.
all right.
yo, I got to round up all outstanding debts that are due asap, all right?
do it right now?
like yesterday, all right?
I'll put it out there. Good.
are you insane?
you are done, bodyguard.
lincoln's son, a 16-year-old pothead, managed to track you down and shoot you.
you are now a witness in his criminal investigation.
I can still do my job.
you are not to make a move on burrows under any circumstance.
we make that call.
you know what, trixie?
there are actually higher agendas here.
Yes, there are, and they don't belong to you.
paul kellerman no longer works for the secret service.
you're just good ol'owen kravecki from now on.
have I made myself clear?
Hey.
I need you to focus.
I need you to remember what you drew.
time for group.
come on, buddy. Let's go.
it's a path.
Yes.
it is a path.
let's go.
so, what's up, man?
here's the thing.
you got nothing coming.
all your outstanding markers, they're mine now.
is that so?
you got a problem with it, go cry to your new crew
t-bag and the white boys.
Oh...'kay, so that's what this is all about.
this is about staying true to your own.
well, you know what, man?
I can have tea with the grand wizard of the kkk if I want, and I still get my money.
you got that, little boy?
no. We don't got that.
now, out of respect for what you once were,
I'm gonna let you walk away.
you were right.
the pills don't let me see the pathway.
that's a pathway to hell.
no, it's not.
it's just the opposite.
I remember.
Whoo! Looks like the bank of africa wasn't allowing any withdrawals.
look, we are gonna have to find another way to get that money, okay?
well, then I reckon it ain't too much of a problem for our friend here to rummage up, ain't that so, D.B?
a) I'm not D. B. Cooper, and b) there's no visitation today.
which means that none of us can get any money from the outside world.
I guess that only leaves us with one real option.
the kitchen game.
gambling?
that's your solution?
Uh-huh. Son, trust me.
when I play cards, it ain't gambling.
there's maybe five people in this country that can do what I do with a deck of cards.
so why are you just bringing this up now?
cause if jesus over there catches you sleeving aces in the kitchen game, well, let's just say there are lots of knives handy.
I'd say we're in a catch-double-deuce.
you sit right here.
take this.
and this.
Oh, no...it's gone.
that's why I need you to fix it.
that's why I need you to remember what was there before.
Oh, this is bad.
you can't break a path.
then it doesn't lead anywhere.
that's right.
that's why I need you to remember what was there before it was broken.
I remember.
I remember the demons.
wait, maybe they were pilgrims.
they were pointing the way, they were saying, "this is the way, this is the way.
I can't see it.
I can see it, but I-I can't see it.
I'll be right back.
Hey!
I need you to give sucre a message.
tell him I'm okay, and that I'm trying to fill in the blanks.
he'll know what that means.
you're trying to fill in the blanks?
just do it. Please.
what the hell am I gonna do now?
you've been down on 13 as long as I can remember.
why the sudden interest in moving?
second-story units like this don't come on the market too much.
I figure since I'm getting on in age, maybe it's time I retired in comfort.
open on 40.
make it quick.
hey... bob vila, it's a cell.
quit kicking the tires and make a decision.
I'll give you 100 bucks for her.
you wasted my time. Get the hell out of here.
sorry, boss.
I thought it was a good bid.
close on 40.
Hello, benjamin.
now, let me see, minted in 19 and... seventy-two.
that's your buy-in.
the rest is up to you.
damn...
keep walking, peckerwood.
got the buy-in for the card game.
go get our money, boy.
unfortunately, you and i are gonna have to be partners in this endeavor.
Oh, hell, no.
I don't play cards;I'm a dice man.
look, all you need to know is this:
every time I deal, you bet big and never fold.
see, if I'm winning every time I deal, I end up with a colombian necktie, you know what I'm saying?
but if you're the one raking in all the cash, well, I seriously doubt anyone would ever think you and I are working together.
excuse me.
I've been all over town-- I can't find a charger for this.
well, let me check. - Thanks.
how you doing, savrinn?
Where's your girl?
she's doing her job, all right?
filing a petition down at the courts.
she'll... she'll be at my place in about an hour.
see, that was easy.
I shouldn't have to chase you down to get that information.
why don't you just take a step back?
why don't you remember who you're talking to, who I work for?
you need to keep an eye on veronica donovan.
not some of the time;all of the time.
cause pretty soon, we're gonna call in our favor, unless you want to go back on our deal.
no.
good.
be in touch.
did you take your meds?
come on.
you got something in your teeth again.
you should be careful when you tell people to remember things, michael.
because I remember everything now.
I remember how you set me up!
how you smashed your own head...
and had me sent back here.
I also...
remember this.
the pathway.
your map.
your escape.
give me that.
don't. Don'T.
now, do I tear this up...
...or do you tell me exactly where and when you're doing this?
it starts in the basement. - Okay.
this line leads from a hatch in the coal room to this pipe system here.
and that runs to the infirmary.
that's how we'll get out.
I just need to get out of psych ward to set things up.
three days after I'm gone,
I'll come back up through the basement and get you out.
you're just telling me what I want to hear. - No, I'm not.
I need you to let me get us out of here.
I need you to trust me.
if you try to screw me over again, I'll kill you.
Hey.
Hey. How did it go?
filing the petition was easy.
getting it approved, that's a whole 'nother story.
you found the charger?
Oh, yeah.
why didn't you plug it in?
I was just, uh...
just thinking for a minute.
about what?
nothing.
we're in business.
what is it?
his entire phone book is still in here-- 322 numbers.
no open seats. Gotta wait.
crap or get off the pot.
I'm thinking.
we ain't betting on cpt here, man.
either you going to see his bet or you can go outside and million con march or whatever your people do.
either way, get on with it, son.
I'm in.
three bitches, bitches.
what you holding?
you tell me.
full house.
full house?
that's a concept a mexican should be quite familiar with, eh, jesus?
she said what?
she said, in unequivocal terms, that I was not to move on burrows.
whatever their agenda is with burrows, it is not the same as ours.
this whole business with his father
it interferes with the one thing that we set out to do in the first place
put lincoln burrows in the ground.
if he lives, you're the one that stands to lose, not the company.
they get themselves another candidate, and you're the one that suffers the brunt of it.
then maybe it's time we broke ranks.
we do that, they'd pull support for the campaign.
you know that, don't you?
that is...
if they know, paul.
Mmm! Smell that kitty.
jacks or better, trips to win.
last hand.
I'm tired of losing all my money today.
how much you up?
I don't know. $300.
does it hurt? - What?
the horseshoe up your ass.
rather be lucky than good, ping-pong.
misdeal.
bury the card.
man, I don't care if y'all saw my card.
Yeah, I bet you don'T.
bury the card, young blood.
Hey, chill, wrinkles.
ain't my fault saltine here got a sloppy deal.
Aw, that there was just uncalled for.
now, all right. You know what?
I'll tell you what. I'm going to deal another hand, you gonna be such a baby about it.
on a misdeal, you bury the card, finish out the hand.
house rules.
warden.
I have some good news for you, linc.
somehow, your lawyer's petition went through.
the department of corrections is allowing you a one- hour visit with your son.
I've never seen one of these granted before...
ever.
good lawyers.
no lawyer's that good.
I'll make the travel arrangements, but this is not going to be a ride in the country.
you're gonna be y-cuffed, and the men are gonna be heavily armed.
I don't want any problems.
there won't be; I just want to see my son.
I'll bet all I got.
82
you better have some aces shoved up there with that horseshoe, or that pot's mine.
you in or out?!
I'm in.
and I raise you $74.
I said I only got $82 left.
then I guess you're out of luck.
you never heard of a gentleman's game?
Yes, I have, but this ain't it.
you want to borrow some money?
ask your boys.
but I'm in here to make money, bro.
you want welfare, you'd better vote democrat.
if you know what's good for you, you'll stay away from me in the yard.
you think you're smarter than me?
No! No! No, no, no!
there's a pathway
no, there's a pathway!
there's a pathway!
he's trying to escape! He's trying to escape
this is his map!
he set me up!
zap him!
there he is.
hey boss,
I think you dropped something, man.
that's half a gino.
so when do I move in?
you don'T. - What?
come on, chief, now, we had a deal.
Renegotiation: The price is $700 now.
that ain't right. I just gave you $500.
what you gave me was a down payment.
if you can't come up with the rest, well...
no, no, no, no, no! Wait, wait, wait.
hold on. One minute, all right?
man, he's trying to shake us down.
I'm gonna need that watch.
not an option.
look, would you rather be looking at a picture of your daughter or holding her in your arms once you get outside?
look, man, father time owed me a few bones.
he gave me this in trade.
that should be more than enough to cover it.
eh, not bad.
your problem is somebody already gave me $700 for the cell, so you're S. O.L.
No! Hey, whoa, whoa!
wait a minute, wait a minute.
so you're just gonna take my money and walk?
Yeah, well, write your congressman.
Oh, come on!
Hey.
Hi.
they said you wanted to talk to me.
Yeah, yeah.
okay.
okay.
please.
Thanks. Okay.
I made you something.
it's an ashtray.
um... I don't smoke.
Yeah, I know. But, uh, they only let us make these and jewelry, and I didn't figure you for the macaroni necklace type.
it's very sweet. Uh...
how about we talk about how you're doing?
I think we both know I don't belong here.
I don't remember much about that night, but being locked up in ad seg, something must've snapped.
what I'm trying to say is,
I think I've had enough of arts and crafts.
but that's your call.
and the doctors here do say that you've been acting fine.
the problem is that if you don't tell the pope who burned you, he's gonna lock you back up in ad seg.
and after a couple days of that, you're gonna be right back here.
Michael, I hate what happened to you, and I hate that you're here.
but you have got to let me help you.
if you want to get out of psych ward, and stay out, you've got to tell the pope the truth about that burn.
out with the old, in with the new, cons.
I got a message from your cellie, bro.
he says he's okay and he's trying to fill in the blanks.
did he say he's trying, or that he already got the blanks filled in?
yo, man, I don't know. I didn't write it down.
okay. Now you gotta tell him that I filled in the hole.
Yeah, yeah, I'm done with your little secrets and messages, bro.
I saw scofield's back.
he's got a burn in the same spot as the burn in that guard's shirt.
I don't know what you're doing but I have an idea, huh?
and I'm through helping you until you tell me what's going on.
I can't, bro.
then good luck in the hole, jefe.
no, no, no, no, no! Wait, wait.
who's that?
that's linc, bro.
Linc the sink? - Yeah.
come here.
I think we can work something out.
all I can say is, before I get out of here, geary will pay.
believe that.
no one's getting outta here if maintenance goes to replacing scofield's toilet.
I got a way to help you with your scofield problem.
What'd you say, slim?
I said I got a way to help you with...
who the hell said we had a problem?
it's cool, man. Relax.
Lincoln and sucre told me everything.
what in the hell did they tell you?
exactly what did they tell you?
everything. They said I can come with you, you know, on early parole, if I can help get the fish outta psych.
What're we, the a-train?
everyone gets to ride with us?
why don't you take a walk, before I give you a smack?
you got another solution to our situation?
I didn't think so.
me and my cuz and lincoln...
came up with something.
now, it can work...
but it's risky.
you ready to get out of this aquarium, fish?
assure me I'll be protected.
Michael, you know me well enough by now.
such assurances are not necessary.
with all due respect, warden, if I had been protected in the first place, none of this would have happened.
a name.
he shakes cons down for money, anything he can get his hands on.
he knew I went to college, so he must've...
he must've thought I was rich or something.
anyway, when, uh...
when I couldn't pay up, he held me down with one arm, and burned me with the other.
I don't know what he used, but...
it was hot as hell.
what a surprise.
disconnected.
250 businesses, 72 residences, covering all 50 states...
london, martinique, jakarta, dakar...
all the numbers out of service.
as soon as quinn disappeared, they must've erased the paper trail within days.
is there anything they can't do?
my P. I. Buddy in dc.
what if I send him all this, see if he can make a connection between the numbers?
I'll tell him I need it asap.
thank you.
it's no big deal.
I'll just overnight him all this stuff.
no. For everything.
for hanging in there, keeping me going.
thank you.
sure.
guy with a six era signs for four mil a year.
sucks at his job, he still gets a raise.
you suck at your job.
you should ask the pope for a raise.
very funny.
warden, what brings you to our little clubhouse?
Hey, what gives?
Hey, that was a gift from my old man.
since when is your name Charles and your dad's name Ann?
this is a railroad.
I didn't do nothing!
don't look at me like I'm some con.
you're as crooked as scoliosis.
I don't get caught.
when we get there,
I'll take you out of the y-cuffs and put you in a four-piece.
got it?
got it, boss.
you play nice, I play nice.
understand?
got it.
she's here.
I've got her.
Scofield. For readmittance to gen pop.
welcome home.
Thanks.
I never thought I'd be so glad to be back in my cell.
um... pope...
wanted me to give you this.
what the hell are you staring at, anyway?
everything.
you and your brethren possess what is not rightfully yours.
l don't know what you are talking about.
please. -As you wish.
wait!
my god, forgive me.
ln the sacristy...
...the church of Saint-Sulpice, is the Rose Line.
beneath the Rose.
thank you.
thank you.
thank you.
symbols are a language that can help us understand our past.
as the saying goes, a picture says a thousand words...
...but which words?
lnterpret for me, please, this symbol. First thing that comes to mind.
hatred, racism. -Ku Klux Klan.
Yes, yes, interesting. But they would disagree with you in Spain.
there, they are robes worn by priests.
now this symbol. Anyone?
evil.
ln English, please.
devil's pitchfork.
poor, poor Poseidon.
that is his trident. A symbol of power to millions of the ancients.
now this symbol.
Madonna and child. -Faith. Christianity.
no. No, it's the pagan god Horus and his mother, lsis...
...Centuries before the birth of Christ.
understanding our past determines actively...
...Our ability to understand the present.
so how do we sift truth from belief?
...and thereby define ourselves?
how do we penetrate years, centuries, of historical distortion...
...to find original truth?
tonight, this will be our quest.
my son is a student of yours at Harvard.
michael Culp? He adores you. -Oh, yeah.
he says you're the best teacher he's ever had.
ms. Culp, l think l already gave Michael an A-minus.
he told me. Thank you.
Mr. Langdon?
Hi.
Bonjour, professor.
l'm Lieutenant Collet from DCPJ. A kind of French FBl.
will you take a look at this photo, please?
my police chief, Capitaine Fache, had hoped...
...Considering your expertise and the markings on the body...
...you might assist us.
will you excuse me a moment?
l was supposed to have drinks with him.
Yes, we know.
we found your name in his daily planner.
he never showed. l waited for over an hour.
why would someone do this to him?
Oh, you misunderstand, professor.
he was shot, yes.
but what you see in the photograph...
...Monsieur Sauniere did to himself.
teacher, all four are dead.
the senechaux and the grand Master himself.
then l assume you have the location.
confirmed by all.
lndependently.
l had feared the Priory's penchant for secrecy might prevail.
the prospect of death is strong motivation.
lt is here.
ln Paris, Teacher.
lt hides beneath the Rose in Saint-Sulpice.
you will go forth, Silas.
l chastise my body.
Capitaine Fache is waiting for you.
okay.
Mr. Langdon. -Yes.
l'm Captain Bezu Fache.
you like our pyramid?
lt's magnificent.
a scar on the face of Paris.
after me, please.
lt's the pairing of those two pyramids.
lt's unique.
the two are geometric echoes.
fascinating.
l'm not sure how much help l'm gonna be here this evening.
how well did you know the curator?
not very well.
frankly, l was surprised when he contacted me.
could we take the stairs?
so Sauniere requested tonight's meeting.
Yes.
how? Did he call you?
e-mail. He heard l was in Paris.
had something to discuss.
what?
you seem uncomfortable.
the grand gallery. This is where you found the body.
how would you know that?
l recognize the parquet floor from the Polaroid. lt's unmistakable.
dear god.
let's cover the talking points again, Your Eminence.
many call Opus Dei a brainwashing cult.
others, an ultraconservative Christian secret society.
obviously, some people fear what they don't understand.
perhaps a less defensive tack, Your Eminence.
the press continue to be harsh with us.
we are not Cafeteria Catholics.
we don't pick and choose which rules to follow.
we follow doctrine. Rigorously.
does doctrine necessarily include vows of chastity, tithing...
...and atonement for sins through self-flagellation and the cilice?
many of our followers are married. Many of them have families.
only a small proportion choose to live ascetic lives.
why are some media referring? -That will be all, Michael, thank you.
Aringarosa.
Silas has succeeded. The legend is true.
lt hides beneath the Rose.
my part of our bargain is nearly fulfilled.
l meet the council in an hour.
l will have your money tonight, Teacher.
the Vitruvian Man.
lt's one of Leonardo da Vinci's most famous sketches.
and the star on his skin?
a pentacle.
and its meaning?
the pentacle is a pagan religious icon.
devil worship.
no. No, no, no. The pentacle before that.
this is a symbol for Venus.
lt represents the female half of all things
you are telling me that Sauniere's last act on earth...
...was to draw a goddess symbol on his chest? Why?
captain Fache, obviously l can't tell you why.
l can tell you he, as well as anyone, knows the meaning of this symbol...
...and it has nothing to do with worshiping the devil.
ls that so? -Yes.
then...
...what do you make of this?
o, Draconian devil. Oh, lame saint.
lt's a phrase. Doesn't mean anything, not to me.
what would you do if you had such limited time to send a message?
well, l suppose l'd try to identify my killer.
precisely.
precisely.
so, professor
officer Neveu.
please, pardon the interruption.
this is not the time.
l received the crime-scene jpegs at headquarters...
...and l've deciphered the code.
lt's a Fibonacci sequence.
that's the code Sauniere left on the floor.
headquarters sent me to explain, captain.
lt is the Fibonacci sequence.
the numbers are out of order.
but before that, l have an urgent message for Professor Langdon.
right?
pardon me?
l'm Sophie Neveu, French police, Cryptology.
your embassy called Division.
l'm sorry, monsieur, they said it was a matter of life and death.
this is the number of your embassy's messaging service.
well, thank you.
Hello, you've reached the home of Sophie Neveu.
miss Neveu? This...
no. That's the right number.
you have to dial an access code to pick up your messages.
but l'm getting
lt's a three-digit code. lt's on the paper l gave you.
professor Langdon, do not react to this message.
you must follow my directions very closely and, above all...
...Reveal nothing to Captain Fache.
you are in grave danger.
church of Saint-Sulpice.
good evening, Sister.
l need you to show someone our church tonight.
of course, Father.
but so late?
wouldn't tomorrow...?
this is a request from an important bishop of Opus Dei.
lt would be my pleasure.
there's been an accident. A friend.
l have to fly home in the morning.
l see.
ls there a restroom l could use? l just wanna splash some water on my face.
Yes.
she said it is meaningless.
mathematical joke.
ls it meaningless?
l'll take another look when l come back.
l'm sorry. Of course.
do you have a message from Sauniere?
what are you talking about?
crazy old man.
you have me confused with someone else. l came here to check your jacket pocket.
just look.
GPS tracking dot.
accurate within two feet anywhere on the globe.
the agent who picked you up slipped it into your jacket...
...in case you tried to run.
we have you on a little leash, professor.
why would l try to run? l didn't do anything.
so, what do you think about the fourth line of text...
...Fache wiped clean before you arrived?
he brought you here to force a confession, Professor Langdon.
he's still in there? What's he doing?
Fache isn't even looking for other suspects, okay?
he is sure you're guilty.
when did Sauniere contact you?
today? -Yes, yes.
what time? What time?
at 3. Around 3. Three.
we call Fache "the Bull." Once he starts, he doesn't stop.
he can arrest you and detain you for months while he builds a case.
and by then whatever Sauniere wanted you to tell me will be useless.
stop it! Just stop!
who are you?
look at the letters.
P. S. postscript.
"Princesse Sophie." Silly, l know.
but l was only a girl when l lived with him.
jacques Sauniere was my grandfather.
apparently, it was his dying wish that we meet.
lf you help me understand why...
Fache was never gonna let me just stroll out of here, was he?
no.
lf we are to get away from here, we must find another way.
Sauniere was reading his book.
blood trail.
excuse me, captain.
we have a problem.
headquarters didn't send Sophie Neveu.
what?
captain, look at this.
he jumped!
shit.
he's moving again. And fast.
he must be in a car.
he's going south on Pont du Carrousel.
bastard.
that cop will check the whole lower floor.
l will only take a moment.
of course.
he is much older than l remember.
l hadn't seen or spoken to him in a very long time.
he phoned my office today. Several times.
he said it was a matter of life and death.
l thought it was another trick to get back in touch.
lt seems when he couldn't speak to me...
...he reached out to you.
wait a minute. -Professor?
this is wrong. Yeah. See? This is wrong.
the Fibonacci numbers only make sense when they're in order.
these are scrambled.
lf he was trying to reach out, maybe he was doing it in code.
would you hold this, please?
this phrase is meaningless.
unless you assume these letters are out of order too.
an anagram.
you have eidetic memory?
not quite. But l can pretty much remember what l see.
anagram is right.
o, Draconian devil. Oh, lame saint" becomes:
Leonardo da Vinci. The Mona Lisa.
professor, the Mona Lisa is right over here.
look at this. He must have thrown it from the window.
smart to hit the truck.
what, you admire him now?
we're stupid. Who did we leave at the museum?
Ledoux? get him on the radio!
her smile is in the lower spatial frequencies.
the horizon is significantly lower on the left than it is on the right.
Why?
well, see, she appears larger from the left than on the right.
historically, the left was female, the right was male.
there. Blood.
Hey.
so dark the con of man.
no. lt doesn't say that.
ls it another anagram? Can you break it?
professor, hurry. Hurry!
moon. Sermon. Charms.
demons. Omens. Codes. Monks. Ranks. Rocks.
Madonna of the Rocks.
da Vinci.
careful. Careful.
this can't be this. The fleur-de-lis.
lt was Sauniere's.
l remember finding it once when l was a girl.
he'd promised he'd give it to me one day.
have you ever heard those words before, Sophie?
so dark the con of man"?
no. Have you?
when you were a child, were you aware of any secret gatherings?
anything ritualistic in nature?
meetings your grandfather would've wanted kept secret?
was there ever any talk of something called the Priory of Sion?
the what? Why are you asking these things?
the Priory of Sion is a myth.
one of the world's oldest and most secret societies, with leaders like...
...Sir lsaac Newton, da Vinci himself.
the fleur-de-lis is their crest.
they're guardians of a secret they supposedly refer to...
...as "the dark con of man."
but what secret?
the Priory of Sion protects the source of god's power on earth.
l can't do this by myself.
l'm in enough trouble as it is. That's my embassy.
please.
even if we could get out of this
okay.
no, no, no. You're not gonna make it. You're not gonna make it!
well, that was...
we need to get out of sight.
Christ, give me strength.
you are a ghost.
Christ, give me strength.
stealing in a house of god!
you are an angel.
Christ, give me strength.
you have powerful friends.
Bishop Aringarosa has been kind to me.
a pity you couldn't wait for morning.
the light is not ideal.
tell me, Sister, please, of the Rose Line.
set into the streets of Paris, 1 35 brass markers...
...Mark the world's first prime meridian...
...which passed through this very church.
lt hides beneath the Rose.
l'm sorry?
sister.
l do not want to keep you. l will show myself out.
l insist.
may the peace of the Lord be with you.
and with you.
they found Neveu's car abandoned at the train station.
and two tickets to Brussels paid for with Langdon's credit card.
a decoy, l'm sure.
all the same, send an officer to the station.
question all the taxi drivers. l'll put this on the wire.
lnterpol? We're not sure he's guilty.
l know he's guilty. Beyond a doubt.
robert Langdon is guilty.
this is the Bois de Boulogne?
we should be safe in this park for a few minutes.
stay here.
police.
what do you want?
go and get something to eat.
did it occur to you that could be dangerous?
no. And now we have a place to think.
any ideas, professor?
what's the next step?
with him, it's always:
Sophie, what's the next step?
puzzles.
codes.
a treasure hunt.
to find his killer.
maybe there is something about this Priory of Sion.
l hope not.
any Priory story ends in bloodshed. They were butchered by the Church.
lt all started over a thousand years ago when a French king...
... Conquered the holy city of Jerusalem.
this crusade, one of the most massive and sweeping in history...
...was actually orchestrated by a secret brotherhood...
...the Priory of Sion...
...and their military arm, the Knights Templar.
but the Templars were created to protect the Holy Land.
that was a cover to hide their true goal, according to this myth.
supposedly the invasion was to find an artefact lost since the time of Christ.
an artefact, it was said, the Church would kill to possess.
did they find it, this buried treasure?
put it this way:
one day the Templars simply stopped searching.
they quit the Holy Land and travelled directly to Rome.
whether they blackmailed the papacy...
... Or the Church bought their silence, no one knows.
but it is a fact the papacy declared these Priory knights...
... These Knights Templar, of limitless power.
by the 1 300s, the Templars had grown too powerful.
too threatening.
so the Vatican issued secret orders to be opened simultaneously all across Europe.
the Pope had declared the Knights Templar Satan worshipers...
...and said god had charged him with cleansing the earth of these heretics.
the plan went off like clockwork.
the Templars were all but exterminated.
the date was October 1 3th, 1 30 7. A Friday.
friday the 1 3th.
the Pope sent troops to claim the Priory's treasure...
...but they found nothing.
the few surviving Knights of the Priory had vanished...
...and the search for their sacred artefact began again.
what artefact? l've never heard about any of this.
Yes, you have.
almost everyone on earth has.
you just know it as the Holy grail.
please, Sauniere thought he knew the location of the Holy grail?
maybe more than that.
this cross and the flower, this could be very old. But look.
this metal here underneath is much newer, and there's a modern lD stamp.
Haxo 24.
and these dots. These dots are read by a laser.
this is more than a pendant. This is a key your grandfather left you.
he left us, professor.
lt's a street address.
this is Jacques Sauniere.
please, Monsieur Sauniere, pick up the phone.
this is Sandrine Bieil.
l have called the list.
l fear the other guardians are dead.
the lie has been told.
the floor panel has been broken.
please, monsieur, pick up the phone. l beg you.
job 38, verse 1 1 .
do you know it, Sister?
job 38: 1 1 .
hitherto shalt thou come...
...but no further.
but no further.
do you mock me?
where is the keystone?
l do not know.
no.
you are a sister of the Church...
...and yet you serve them: the Priory.
Jesus had but one true message. That
come, you saints of god.
hasten, angels of the Lord.
to receive her soul.
and bring her to the sight of the Almighty.
welcome, bishop.
our words shall never pass these walls.
what business, say you?
as you know, my request for funds
Yes, 20 million euro in untraceable bearer bonds.
a tad more than petty cash. Wouldn't you say, bishop?
l only offer a route to the renewal of faith for all men.
how humble.
our saviour, Bishop Aringarosa.
how dare you presume to
l do not presume, l act!
the Vatican's unwillingness to support us...
...is both impious and cowardly.
blood is being spilled because true Christian values lie in ruins. No more!
this council has forgotten its very purpose.
tonight...
...the grail will be destroyed.
the Priory's few remaining members will be silenced.
l was contacted by a man who calls himself only "the Teacher."
two prostitutes identified Langdon and Neveu...
...Getting into a taxi in the Bois de Boulogne.
because of your expertise?
l'm sorry? -About the Priory.
do you think that's why Sauniere sought you out?
actually, l didn't think he liked me very much.
once made a joke at my expense. got a big laugh out of it.
what was it?
the door to the right, please.
Yes.
understood.
keys are often passed on and first-time users...
keys are essentially numbered Swiss accounts.
often willed through generations.
ls it yours, mademoiselle?

ready? You have your instructions. - Oui, monsieur.
everything all right, Mrs Ho?
dinner will be ready at 7. 30.
good evening. - I don't know if...
you are expected, Colonel. May I take your coat?
it is Colonel Mustard? - No, that's not my name...
tonight, you may well feel obliged to my employer for the use of an alias.
and who are you? - Wadsworth, sir. The butler.
Yvette, give the Colonel anything he requires.
within reason, that is.
Wadsworth, I was...
come in, madam. You are expected.
you know who I am? - You are to be known as Mrs White.
Yes, it said so in the letter. But why?
may I introduce you? Mrs White, this is Yvette, the maid.
as you know each other.
hello. - Hello.
want a lift? - Yes, please!
Thanks. I'm late for a dinner date. - Me too. Where are you going?
let's see... Hill House, off Route 41.
wait, let me look. That's where I'm going. I got a letter like this.
and this is Mrs Peacock. - How do you do?
Yvette, would you again check the dinner will be ready as soon as all the guests have arrived.
is this the address for Mr Boddy? - You must be Mr Green.
Sit!
no... Not you, sir.
it should be just over there.
that must be it.
why has the car stopped? - It's frightened.
what a God-forsaken place!
professor Plum! Miss Scarlet!
I didn't know you were acquainted. - We weren't.
may I present Professor Plum and Miss Scarlet?
of course since you've each been addressed by a pseudonym.
you realise nobody here is being addressed by their real name.
Ah, dinner.
I'm sorry. I'm a little accident-prone.
you'll find your names beside your places. Please be seated.
is this place for your? - No, sir. I'm a butler.
what exactly do you do? - I buttle, sir.
the butler is head of the kitchen and dining-room. I keep things tidy. That's all.
what's all this about, this dinner party?
die? - Merely quoting Tennyson, sir.
I prefer Kipling. "The female of the species is more deadly than the male.
you like Kipling, Mis Scarlet? - Sure, I'll eat anything.
soup.
for our host? - For the seventh guest, Mr Boddy.
I thought Mr Boddy was our host. - So did I.
so, who is our host, Mr Wadsworth?
I want to start. - No, should be wait for the other guests.
I'll keep something warm for him. - What did you have in mind?
well, someone's got to break the ice, so why not me?
I used to be an a hostess, as part of my husband's work.
it's always hard, when new friends meet together for the first time, to get acquainted, so I'm prepared to start the ball rolling.
I have no idea why we're here, why I'm here, what this place is about, but I am determined to enjoy myself. I'm very intrigued, and oh my the soup's delicious, isn't it?
you said you are used to be a hostess as part of your husband's work?
Yes, it's an integral part of your life when you are the wife of a...
I forgot, we mustn't say who we really are, though I don't know why.
don't you? - I know who you are.
will you tell? - How do you know?
I work in Washington, too.
so you're a politician's wife? - Yes, I am.
come on, then. Who's your husband?
so what does your husband do? - Nothing.
he lies around on his back all day. - Sounds like hard work to me.
I'm sorry!
I'm a little accident-prone. - Watch it.
this is one of my favourite recipes. - I know, madam.
what do you do in Washington DC, Mr Green?
come on! What do you do? How can we get acquainted if we say nothing about ourselves?
I don't think he want to get acquainted of you.
but I'm sure, I don't know, but if I wasn't keep the conversation going we'd just be sitting here in an embarrassed silence.
are you afraid of silence, Peacock? - Yes... No... Why?
you seem to suffer from what we call "pressure of speech."
who's "we"? Are you a shrink?
I do know a little about psychological medicine, yes.
are you a doctor? - I am but I don't practise.
practice makes perfect. I think most men need a little practice, don't you think?
so what do you do? - I work for the United Nations.
another politician!
I work for a branch of the UNO, WHO, the World Health Organisation.
what is your area of concern? - Family planning.
are you a real colonel? - I am, sir.
you're not going to mention you also live in Washington DC?
how did you know that? Did we met before?
I've certainly seen you before. Although you may not have seen me.
so Miss Scarlett, Do you live in Washington, too? - I sure do.
does anyone not live in Washington? - I don't.
but you work for the United Nations, a government job.
and also rent a government house. Anyone here not earn their living from the government? One by another?
Where's our host and why we are brought here?
good evening. You are eagerly awaited.
locking me in? I'll take the key. - Over my dead body, sir.
may I take your bag? - No. It's what I need it.
it contains evidence? - Surprises, my friend, that's what it contains.
ladies and gentlemen, may I present Mr Boddy?
what are they doing here? - Eating dinner.
do sit down, Mr Boddy. - Thanks.
no, you can take that away, honey.
I demand to know what's going on. Why have we been dragged here? This house place...
well, I believe we all received a letter.
my letter says, "It will be to your advantage to be present on this date, "because a Mr Boddy will end a certain long-standing, confidential, painful, and financial liability.
signed, "A friend." - I got a similar letter.
so did we, didn't we? - I also received a letter.
no, thanks Yvette. I just ate. - How did ou know her name?
we know each other, don't we, dear?
forgive my curiosity, Mr Boddy，but did your letter said the same thing?
no. - I see.
can I interest any of you in fruit, or dessert?
can I suggest we adjourn to study, for coffee and brandy,
at which point I believe our unknown host will reveal his intentions.
there's no one here. - Please help yourselves of brandy and be seated.
mind if I smoke?
I'm instructed to explain to you what you all have in common, unless you would care to do the honours, Mr Boddy?
Why? They know who I am? - I don't think so.
it's a hoax. I suggest we all leave. - You cannot leave this house!
no? Who's gonna stop me? - There's no way out.
all the windows are blocked, all the doors are locked.
outrageous! You can't imprison us! - Ladies and gentlemen!
please return to the study. Everything will be explained.
you too, Mr Boddy.
the other way!
you can't go that way. - It's only glass.
you all have one thing in common. You're all being blackmailed.
you have all been paying money to someone who threatens to expose you.
and none of you know who's blackmailing you.
please! That's ridiculous. Nobody could blackmail me.
my life is an open book. I've never done anything wrong.
anybody else wish to deny it?
as everyone's in the same boat, there's no harm in revealing details.
and my instructions are to do so. Thank you, Yvette.
can't you spare us this humiliation? - I'm sorry.
professor Plum. You were a psychiatry professor, helping paranoid, homicidal lunatics with delusions of grandeur.
now I work for the UN. - The same job.
you don't practise medicine.
his licence has been lifted. - Why? What did he do?
you know what doctors mustn't do with patients? He did.
how disgusting! - Are you making moral judgements?
can you justify taking bribes, for handing your husband's vote to lobbyists?
nothing wrong with paid consultancy. - Not if it's publicly declared.
but what if it's used greenbacks slipped under the door of the men's room?
it stinks. - Were you in the men's room?
it's true? - It's a vicious lie.
I'm sure we're glad to hear that.
but you've paid blackmail for over a year to keep it out of the papers.
I'm being blackmailed for something I didn't do.
me too.
not me. - No?
I'm being blackmailed, but I did what I'm being blackmailed for.
what did you do?
I run a service providing gentlemen with the company of a young lady.
Oh, yeah?
what's the phone number?
you knew the Colonel works in Washington. Is he a client?
No! - I asked Miss Scarlet.
say it's not true. - It's not.
true? - No.
it is true! - A double negative!
you have photos? - Sounds like a confession.
the double negative has led to proof positive.
trying to make me look stupid?
you don't need any help from me. - Right!
what's so terrible about the Colonel visiting a house of ill fame?
most soldiers do. - Please!
he holds a sensitive post in the Pentagon.
you drive a very expensive car for a colonel's pay.
I came into money during the war when I lost my momy and daddy.
Mrs White, you've been paying since your husband died under mysterious circumstances.
why is that funny? - That's why he's on his back. In a coffin.
I didn't kill him. - So why pay the blackmailer?
I don't want a scandal. We'd had a very humiliating confrontation.
he was deranged. He was a lunatic.
he didn't like me. He threatened to kill me in public.
why kill you in public? - He threatened, in public, to kill her.
was that his final word? - Being killed is pretty final.
yet he was the one who died, not you. - What did he do for a living?
a scientist. Nuclear physics.
what was he like?
a stupidly optimistic man. It came as a shock to him when he died.
he was found at home, his head had been cut off and his...
you know...
I'd been at the movies. - Miss him?
it's life after death. Now he's dead, I have a life.
your first husband also disappeared. - That was his job. An illusionist.
but he never reappeared. - He wasn't a very good illusionist.
I have something to say.
I'm not going to wait for Wadsworth to unmask me.
I work for the State Department. And I'm a homosexual.
I feel no personal shame or guilt about this.
but I must keep it a secret or I'll lose my job on security grounds.
thank you.
well...
that just leaves Mr Boddy. - What's your little secret?
his secret? Hadn't you guessed? He's your blackmailer.
you bastard! - Colonel!
gentlemen! - If you can't fight fairly, don't fight.
he called me a bastard!
was that necessary, Mrs White? - Wait! The police are coming.
Oh, no! - My career is very sensitive...
listen! Blackmail depends on secrecy.
you admit he's blackmailing you.
tell the police, convict him, and it will be over.
it's not so easy. You'll never tell the police.
I shall. I have evidence, and this conversation is being recorded.
recordings aren't admissible evidence. - Ladies and gentlemen!
the police will be here in about 45 minutes.
tell them the truth and Mr Boddy will be behind bars.
where are you going? - I can help them decide.
I'll get my bag.
who can guess what's in here? - The evidence against us, no doubt.
did you know you'd see us tonight? - Yes.
what were you told? - That you'd be discussing our little deal.
and if I didn't appear, Wadsworth would tell the police about it.
naturally, I could hardly resist putting in an appearance.
excuse me.
open 'em. - Why not?
I enjoy getting presents from strange men.
a candlestick? What's this for?
in your hands, you each have a lethal weapon.
if you denounce me to the police, you will also be exposed and humiliated.
I'll see to that in court.
but... if one of you kills Wadsworth now, no one but the seven of us will ever know.
he has the key to the front door which he said would only be opened over his dead body.
I suggest we take him up on that offer.
the only way to stay off the front pages is for one of you to kill Wadsworth...
now!
it's not Wadsworth! - Is he alive?
stand back! Give him air. Let me see...
he's dead.
who had the gun? - Me, but I didn't shoot.
you had the gun. If you didn't, who did?
nobody! No gunshot wound! Somebody grabbed the gun and it went off.
look, the bullet broke that vase on the mantle.
sorry. - Excuse me.
he's right. There's a bullet hole in the wall.
how did he die? - I don't know. I'm not a forensic expert.
one of us must have killed him. - I didn't.
I need a drink!
maybe he was poisoned!
Mrs Peacock, please. It's all right.
we don't know anything. Sit down. Sit down, Mrs...
I... had to stop her from screaming.
but was the brandy poisoned? - I don't...
looks like we'll never know. - Unless... Unless she dies too.
it's locked. - Open up!
it must be the murderer! - Screaming?
it must be Yvette. - Oh, my God!
you're alive! - No thanks to you.
what have you mean? - You locked me up with a murderer! - The murderer is in this room?
where? - Where? Here!
we are looking at him, or her. As Mrs White said, one of you is the killer.
how do you know? - I was listening.
but why were you screaming in here? - I am frightened.
I also drink the cogna. Mon Dieu, I can't stay in here by myself.
come with us. - With the murderer?
there is safety in numbers, my dear.
no clue how he died? - No.
this is absolutely terrible. It's not what I intended. Oh, my God!
not what you intended? - You're not the butler?
not the butler, but a butler. In fact, I was his butler.
if he invited us, why was he late?
I invited you. I wrote the letters. It was all my idea.
wait a minute. I don't understand.
why invite us? Were you helping him blackmail us?
certainly not! - You had better explain.
please sit down, everyone.
when I said I was Mr Boddy's butler, it was true but misleading.
I was once his butler. But it was not his death that ended my employment.
when did it end? - When my wife decided to end her life.
she too was being blackmailed by this odious man who lies dead.
he hated my wife for the same reason he hated you.
he believed you were all thoroughly un-American.
sorry. - He felt it was inappropriate for a senator to have a corrupt wife, a doctor to take advantage of patients, for a wife to emasculate her husband and... so forth...
it's ridiculous. Why didn't he report us to the authorities?
he decided to use his information to make some money - very American!
what was your role? - I was a victim, too.
at least, my wife was. She had friends who were...
socialists! - Oh, my God!
well, we all make mistakes.
he threatened to report her unless she named her friends.
she refused, so he blackmailed her. We had no money.
the price of his silence was that we work for nothing, like slaves.
to make a long story short... - Too late!
the suicide of my wife created a sense of injustice in me.
I resolved to put Mr Boddy in jail.
it seemed the best way to do it, and free you from blackmail too, was to get everyone face to face, confront Mr Boddy with his crimes, and turn him over to the police.
so, everything is explained. - We still don't know who killed him.
we have to find out before the police arrive.
we can't have the police now! - How can we know which of you did it?
why "which of you"? - I didn't.
all of us had the opportunity and a motive.
great! - Maybe it wasn't one of us.
who else? - Who else is here?
the cook... - The cook!
well, she's not here.
I didn't do it!
would somebody help me, please? Help me, please!
don't touch it, it's evidence. - We have to find out who did this.
you'd better explain yourself. - Me? Why?
why kill the cook? - Dinner was OK.
how can you make jokes? - It's my defence mechanism.
some defence! If I was the killer, I'd kill you next.
I said "if..."!
the only admitted killer here is her. - I've admitted nothing.
how many husbands have you had? - Mine?
yours. - Five, just five.
husbands are like Kleenex, soft, strong, disposable.
you lure them like a spider with flies.
flies are where men are vulnerable. - Right.
if it wasn't you, who was it? Who had the dagger? Mrs Peacock!
I put it down, in the study. - When?
I don't know... Before I fainted, after I fainted.
but any of you could have picked it up.
I suggest we take the cook's body into the study.
Why? - I'm the butler. I keep the kitchen tidy.
look! The body's gone!
what are you staring at? Who's there? - Nobody.
what do you mean? - No body. Mr Boddy's body has gone.
maybe he wasn't dead. We should have made sure.
by cutting his head off? - Really!
where is he? - We'd better look for him.
well...
he couldn't have been dead. - He was! At least, I thought he was.
what's the difference? - Quite a difference to him.
maybe there is life after death. - As improbable as sex after marriage.
maybe Mr Boddy killed the cook! - Yes!
how?
if you'll excuse me... Is there a little girl's room?
Oui, oui, madame. - No, I just want to powder my nose.
what's this?
the negatives the Colonel referred to. - My God!
planning to blackmail him? - Certainly not!
I was going to give them to the Colonel once Mr Boddy was unmasked.
very pretty! Want to see? They might shock you.
no, I am a lady. - So how d'you know what they're like?
what are they like? - I'd like them back.
something in them concerns me, too. - Let me see.
my! Nobody can get into that position. - Sure they can. Let me show you.
get off!
mr Boddy! He's attacking her.
no, he's dead. - Mr Boddy, dead? Again?!
Oh, my God! - She's fainting.
catch her! - I'll catch her. Fall into my arms.
sorry. - You've got blood on your hands.
I didn't do it!
he's got new injuries.
he's dead now. Why kill him twice?
unnecessary. - What we call "overkill."
psychotic. - Unless he wasn't dead.
so what? - That's what we want to find out!
who killed him, where, and with what. - No need to shout.
I'm not shouting!
all right, I am. I'm shouting, I'm shouting...
OK, put the corpses on the sofa.
ladies first.
don't get blood on the sofa. - The dagger will go further into her back.
tip her forward, over the arm.
now Mr Boddy.
ready...
a little higher. - There you go.
now... Who...
who had the candlestick? - It was given to you.
I dropped it. Anyone could've picked it up.
we have all these weapons, the gun, the rope, the wrench, the lead pipe.
let's lock them all in this cupboard. There's a homicidal maniac about.
that's wise. - Good idea.
why are you pocketing the key? - To keep it safe.
that means you can open it. What if you're the murderer?
I'm not. - What if you are?
it has to go somewhere. I know I'm safe.
we don't!
I have an idea. We'll throw it away. - Good idea.
brilliant. - That'll do it.
sorry...
sorry... Can we help?
I didn't mean to disturb the whole household.
my car broke down and I was wondering if I could use your phone.
just a moment.
very well, sir. Would you care to come in?
well, where is it? - The body?
the phone. What body? - No body. Nobody in the study.
No! - But there's a phone in the lounge.
thank you.
when you've finished, please wait here. - Certainly.
Where's the key? - The key to the weapons cupboard.
you still wish me to throw it away? - Yes!
well... What now?
Wadsworth, let me out. - No, we've got to know who did it.
if you go, I'll say you killed them both. - Me too.
I'll make you sorry you started this, one day when we're alone.
no sane man would be alone with you.
I could use a drink. - So could I.
just checking... Two corpses, everything's fine.
anybody else want a whisky? - Yeah.
all right, look. Pay attention, everybody.
am I right that there is nobody else here?
no. - There is someone else.
no, I said no meaning yes. - No meaning yes?
I want a straight answer. Is there someone else? Yes or no?
no. - No, there is, or no, there isn't?
Yes. - Please!
shouldn't we get rid of that man before he finds out what's going on?
we can't throw him out. - If he stays, he'll get suspicious.
if he goes, he'll be suspicious. - I'd be suspicious.
who cares? Let him stay locked up for another half an hour.
the police will be here by then, and there are two dead bodies in the study!
there's confusion as to whether there's anyone else here.
there isn't. - Confusion or anybody else?
either. Or both. - Gimme a clear answer.
certainly. The question? - Is anybody else here?
No! - So he says. But does he know?
I suggest we do this in military fashion. We split up and search the house.
split up?! - Yes.
we have very little time, so we'll split into pairs.
what if one of us is the murderer?
whoever is left with the killer might get killed.
then we'll discover the murderer. - But one of the pair will be dead!
this is war, Peacock! Casualties are inevitable.
making omelettes means breaking eggs, every cook knows.
look what happened to the cook!
will you take that chance? - What choice have we?
none. - You're right.
Bon, d'accord. But it is dark upstairs. Will anyone go with me?
I will. - No, thank you.
I suggest we all draw lots, for partners.
ready? The two shortest together, the next two shortest together. Agreed?
I suggest the two shortest search the cellar and so on, up.
it's you and me, honey-bunch.
the cellar.
we know what's in the study and the library.
the stranger's in the lounge. - Let's go with the billiard-room.
want to go in front? - Absolutely no.
I'm sure there's no one there. - Then you go.
all right.
well, ladies first. - No, you can go first.
I insist. - I insist.
afraid of a fate worse than death? - Just death.
are you going in there? - Yes.
right. - Right.
I see no light switches. - Nor do I. There must be some.
shall I come with you? - No!
I mean... No, thank you.
ladies first. - No, thanks.
go on, I'll be right behind you. - That's why I'm nervous.
then we go together.
stay there!
if there's anybody in here, just look out!
are you hiding? I'm coming!
what room's this? - Search me.
all right. - Get your mitts off me.
nobody here. - He's behind one of those curtains.
you look. I'll search the kitchen.
I'm a little nervous.
I'm in this big house, and I've been locked into the lounge.
yes...
the funny thing is, there's a group of people here having a sort of party.
and one of them is my old boss from...
looks like a secret passage.
shall we see where it leads? - What the hell?
I'll go first. I've had a good life.
Oh, God! - It's all right.
Oh, my God!
come on! We're locked in here!
help!
down here! Get us out of here!
Where's it coming from? - Where are we going?
where are they? - The lounge.
we're in here!
the door's locked! - I know!
Where's the key? - It's gone!
never mind, unlock the door! - I can't unlock it without the key!
let us in! - Let us out!
it's no good. Stand back.
there's no alternative. I guess I have to break it down.
I know, I have it! - Help!
will you shut up? We're doing our best!
they're shooting at us.
I've been shot! - Come out! The door is open!
why are you shooting at us? - To get you out.
you could have killed us. I could've been killed.
I can't take any more scares.
look!
which one of you did it? - We found him, together.
how did you get in? -The door was locked. -Great entrance. -There's a secret passage.
is that the same gun? The cupboard was locked!
no, it was unlocked. - Unlocked?
Oh yes, see for yourself.
how did you know that's unlocked? Hou did know you could get at the gun?
I didn't. I think I could break it open, but it was open already.
a likely story.
maybe they'll just go away.
I'm going to open it. - Why?
I have nothing to hide, I didn't do it! The key.
thank you.
good evening, sir.
yes? - I found an abandoned car at the gate of this house.
did the driver come in here for help? - No.
well, actually, yes. - No!
seems to be some disagreement. - No!
Yes.
can I come in and use your phone? - Of course, sir.
you may use the one in the... No...
you could use the one in the st... No...
would you be kind enough to wait in... in the library?
sure.
don't I know you from someplace?
you all seem very anxious about something.
I guess the chandelier fell and almost killed us. Would you come this way, sir?
frightfully draughty, these old houses.
please help yourself to a drink, if you'd like.
not the cognac, just in case. - In case of what?
what now?
we should've told. - You say that now.
I said it then. - Oh, shut up!
let's clean this up.
Hello?
the cop answered it. - And who shall I say is calling?
would you hold on, please?
let me outta here! You have no right to shut me in.
I'll book you for false arrest, wrongful imprisonment, and obstructing an officer in the course of his duty and murder.
what do you mean, "murder"?
I just said it so you'd open the door. What's going on?
why lock me in? Why are you getting calls from J Edgar Hoover?
J Edgar Hoover? - That's right. The head of the FBI!
why is he on your phone? - He's on everyone's. Why not mine?
excuse me.
what's going on here? - We're having a party.
mind if I look around? - Sure!
you can show him around, Mr Green. - Me?
Yes, you can show him the dining-room, the kitchen, the ballroom...
fine!
fine. Officer, come with me.
I'll show you the dining-room or the kitchen or the ballroom...
make it look convincing.
so, this is the dining-room. - No kidding!
come on!
what's going on in those two rooms? - Which two rooms?
those two rooms. - Oh, those two rooms!
Yes.
officer, you shouldn't go in there. - Why not?
because it's all too shocking.
it's not all that shocking. These folks are just having a good time.
my God!
excuse me.
this man's drunk. Dead drunk. - Dead right!
you're not going to drive home? - He won't drive, I promise you.
he'll get a lift? - We'll get him a car.
a long black car. - A limousine.
officer! - You are too late. I've seen it all.
I can explain everything. - You don't have to.
don't worry, it's nothing illegal. - Are you sure?
this is America. - I see.
it's a free country. - I didn't know it was that free.
may I use your phone now? - Certainly.
why did you lock him again?
we haven't finished searching the house yet!
only 15 minutes till the police come. - They already came!
shut up! - Let's get on with it.
look! I can't believe it. I wonder where this one goes?
let's find out.
let's try the ballroom again.
don't you touch me!
Hello?
shut the door. Did anyone recognise you?
they must have. And not just my face. They know every inch of my body.
and they're not the only ones.
it's you!
there's something funny going on around here, I don't know what it is.
no, I'm not on duty. But I have a feeling that I'm in danger.
you know that big, ugly house...
Hello?
Hello?
are you there?
I am Your singing telegram!
I'm coming! I'm just trying to find the door.
help me, please! - Coming.
what's this? Another door?
two murders.
neither was shot. I heard a gun. - So did I.
I heard the front door slam. - The murderer must have run out.
three murders. - Six altogether.
this is getting serious.
no gun. Yvette dropped it here.
very well. I know who did it. - You do?
furthermore, I'm going to tell you how it was done.
follow me.
to help you understand, I shall take you through the events step by step.
at the start, Yvette was here by herself, waiting to offer you champagne.
I was in the hall.
I know, I was there. Then I hurried across to the kitchen.
the cook was in here, alive, sharpening knives.
and then...
the doorbell rang...
it was you. I asked for your coat and stopped you from saying your name as I wanted you to use pseudonyms. I introduced myself as the butler, and I ran across the hall to the library.
then Yvette met you, and smiled, and poured you a drink.
the doorbell rang. It was Mrs White. I took her coat and hung it up.
I introduced Mrs White to Colonel Mustard, and I noticed that Mrs White and Yvette flinched.
there was a rumble of thunder and a crash of lightning.
in short... - Too late!
you all arrived.
then the gong was struck by the cook and we went into the dining-room.
Mrs Peacock sat here, Professor Plum here.
Mrs White, Mr Green, Miss Scarlet, Colonel Mustard.
this chair was vacant. Anyway, we all revealed we'd had a letter...
get on with it! - The point is, blackmail.
all this came out in the study. - You're right.
mr Green stood here, Mrs Peacock here, Miss Scarlet, Professor Plum, Colonel...
get on with it! - I'm getting there!
mr Boddy got packages from the hall, you opened your presents,
mr Boddy switched out the lights...
Oh, my God. - Grand!
mr Boddy lay apparently dead. - He was dead!
so why was he bashed with a candlestick?
OK, I made a mistake! - Right.
but why did Mr Boddy pretend he was dead?
because he realised his scheme had misfired.
the gunshot was intended to kill him, not me.
the bullet grazed him. He escaped death by pretending to be dead already.
whoever grabbed the gun was trying to kill him!
what happened next? Mrs Peacock took a drink.
you said, "Maybe it's poisoned." She screams.
we took her to the sofa...
mr Green...
well, I had to stop her screaming...
then more screaming. Yvette! We all rushed to the billiard-room.
but one of us wasn't here. No. - No?
no. Maybe one of us was murdering the cook.
who wasn't here with us? - Do you know?
I do. While we stood here, trying to stop Yvette from panicking, one of us could have taken the dagger, run down the hall, and stabbed the cook.
we'd have seen them run back. - Not if they used this secret passage.
and the murderer ran down the passage to the study.
is that where it comes out? - Yes, look.
how did you know? - This house belongs to a friend of mine. I know a long.
you could be the murderer. - Ridiculous!
if I was the murderer, why would I tell you how I did it?
who else knew of the passage? - Me and the Colonel found it.
you could've known all along. - Why should we believe you?
she was with us while Yvette was screaming, remember?
why was the cook murdered? She had nothing to do with Mr Boddy.
she did! I gathered you here because you were all implicated in his blackmail.
did none of you deduce that the others were involved, too?
who? - The cook and Yvette.
No! - That's how he got his information.
before blackmailing anyone, he had to discover their secret.
the cook and Yvette were accomplices.
I see. So, whoever knew that the cook was involved killed her? - Yes.
I know, as Mr Boddy's butler, that the cook worked for one of you.
who? - You recognised Yvette. Don't deny it.
what do you mean? I deny nothing. - Another denial.
OK, I knew Yvette. My husband had an affair with her. I didn't care.
you knew Yvette. - She worked for me.
you also knew her. You were one of Miss Scarlet's clients.
that's why you wanted those photos. You and Yvette in flagrante delicto.
mr Boddy threatened to send them to my mother. It would've killed her.
amazing, since you told us she's dead already. So, he had the motive.
you all did. - Where and when was Mr Boddy killed?
don't you see? We came back from the study. Mr Boddy was on the floor, pretending to be dead. One of us knows he's alive.
I said I'd invited you and we realised there was only one other person here.
the cook!
where is he?
she was dead. We laid her down, our backs to the freezer.
one of us went through the passage... - Again?
...Back to the study.
the murderer was in the passage. Mr Boddy had been on the floor.
he jumped up...
the murderer came out, picked up the candlestick...
mr Boddy followed us into the hall, the murderer crept up behind him...
and killed him! - Will you stop that?
no.
then he threw him into the toilet.
and joined us in the kitchen. It took half a minute.
so who wasn't in the kitchen? - That is the murderer.
we put the weapons in here, locked it, and ran to the door to throw away the key.
the motorist!
I put the key in my pocket. Someone could have swapped it for another.
it could have been any one of us. - Precisely.
wait a minute...
Colonel Mustard has a top secret job,
Mrs White's husband was a nuclear physicist, and...
Yvette is a link between them.
what is your job, Colonel? - I can tell you.
he's working on the next fusion bomb.
how did you know? - Keep a secret? Me too.
was this a plot? Or did Colonel Mustard do it alone?
we'll see. Let's look at the other murders.
bad luck the motorist arrived. - No luck. I invited him.
you did? - It's obvious.
everyone was Mr Boddy's victim or accomplice.
everyone who died gave him information about one of you.
I got them here to force him to confess.
what about that motorist? What information did he have?
he was my driver during the war. - What was he holding over you?
he knew that I was a war profiteer.
I stole essential Air Force radio parts and sold them on the black market.
that's how I made my money. It doesn't make me a murderer.
a lot of our airmen died because their radios didn't work.
was the policeman working for Mr Boddy, too?
the cop was from Washington, on my payroll.
I bribed him so I could carry on with business. Mr Boddy found out.
Oh, my God! - Oh, please!
and the singing telegram girl?
she was my patient once. I had an affair with her.
that's how I lost my licence. Mr Boddy found that out, too.
let's put her in the study with the others.
so, now you all know why they died.
whoever killed Mr Boddy wanted his accomplices dead.
how did the murderer know?
I guessed that the singer informed on me to Mr Boddy, but I knew nothing of you until now.
the murderer needed to get the weapons and stole the key from my pocket.
then Colonel Mustard suggested we search the house.
that's right! It was his suggestion.
one of us slipped away and hurried to the study.
on the desk was the envelope containing photos and letters, the evidence of Mr Boddy's informants.
Where's the envelope now? - Gone.
destroyed. Perhaps in the fire, the only possible place.
Aha...! Then the murderer went to the cupboard, unlocked it, took the wrench...
then we found the passage to the lounge and found the motorist dead.
that's right! We couldn't get in, so we went back, got the gun and shot the door open, bang! And then the doorbell rang.
whoever it is must go away or they'll be killed.
good evening! Have you ever get any thought of Kingdom of Heaven?
what? - The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.
you ain't kiddin'. - Armageddon is almost upon us.
it's already here! - Go away!
your souls are in danger. - Our lives are in danger, you beatnik!
the cop came, we put him in the library. We forgot the open cupboard, split up.
and the murderer switched off the electricity.
Oh, my God! - Turn on the lights!
didn't mean to frighten you. - Bit late for that... I hate that!
then came three more murders. None of us killed Mr Boddy or the cook.
so who did?! - The one person who wasn't with us.
Yvette. - Yvette!
she was listening to us. She heard the shot and thought he was dead.
while we examined the bullet-hole, she got the dagger, ran to the kitchen, and stabbed the cook. We heard nothing because Mrs Peacock was screaming.
Yvette returned, screamed and we ran to her.
when did she kill Mr Boddy? - When I said.
we ran to see the cook. Yvette checked that Mr Boddy was dead.
he followed into the hall, she hit him on the head and dragged him to the toilet.
Why? - To create confusion.
it worked. - Why did she do it?
was she obeying orders from the person who later killed her?
who? - Who?
who?
was it one of her clients?
or was it a jealous wife? Or an adulterous doctor?
no, it was her employer, Miss Scarlet. - That's a lie.
is it? You used her the way you always used her.
you killed the motorist.
how did I know about the passage? - Yvette told you.
when we split up again, you switched off the electricity.
you got the lead pipe and the rope, strangled Yvette, ran to the library, killed the cop, picked up the gun, opened the door, recognised the singer from her photo, and shot her.
you've no proof. - The gun is missing.
gentlemen, turn out your pockets. Ladies, empty your purses.
whoever has the gun is the murderer.
brilliant! I congratulate you.
me too! - Shut up!
one thing I don't understand. - One thing?
Why? Half of Washington knows your business.
you were in no danger. The whole town would be implicated with you.
they don't know that my real business is secrets.
and Yvette found them out for me.
the secrets of Senator Peacock's defence committee,
Colonel Mustard's fusion bomb, Professor Plum's UN contacts, and the work of your husband, the nuclear physicist.
so, it is political. You're a Communist!
no, Mr Green. Communism is just a red herring.
like all prostitutes, I'm a capitalist and I'm going to sell my secrets, your secrets, to the highest bidder.
what if we don't cooperate? - You will, or I'll expose you.
we could expose you. Six murders... - It won't help your reputation at the UN.
you're implicated not only in adultery with a patient but in her death.
and the deaths of five others. - You don't know the UN, it might help.
it's no good, I've no more money. - Neither do I.
I know. But you can pay me in government information, all of you.
except you, Wadsworth.
as a butler, you have no access to government secrets.
so, I'm afraid your moment has come.
not so fast! I do have a secret or two. - Such as?
game's up. There are no bullets in that gun.
I'm not falling for that trick. - It's no trick.
one for Boddy, two for the chandelier, two at the door and one for the singer.
that's not six. - One plus two plus two plus one.
one for the chandelier. One plus two plus one plus one.
that's one plus one plus two plus one. Not one plus two plus one plus one.
one plus two plus... Shut up!
the point is, there's one bullet, and guess who's gonna get it?
I'm only a guest!
Where's the Chief?
well done, Wadsworth.
I warned you. Mr Hoover is an expert on Armageddon.
don't hate me for trying to shoot you.
frankly, Scarlet, I don't give a damn. There are no bullets in this gun.
plus two, plus one... is...
in the dark, the murderer ran to the study, got the rope and lead pipe, ran to the billiard-room, strangled Yvette...
ran to the library, hit the cop. The doorbell, it was the singing telegram.
the murderer picked up the gun, ran to the door, recognised and shot the girl.
then ran back to the cellar. - The cellar!
Colonel Mustard wasn't in the cellar! - No... But you were!
so?
you were missing when the cook and Mr Boddy died.
the cook used to be your cook. Remember your fatal mistake?
you told us at dinner we were eating your favourite dish.
monkey's brains, though popular in Cantonese cuisine, are not often found in Washington DC.
is that what we ate?
why murder the others? - In case Mr Boddy'd told them of you.
it was nothing to do with a nuclear physicist and the fusion bomb?
no, Communism was a red herring. Mrs Peacock did it all.
there's no proof. - The gun is missing.
gentlemen, turn out your pockets. Ladies, empty your purses.
whoever has the gun is the murderer.
very well.
what do you propose to do about it?
nothing. - Nothing?
nothing. I don't approve of murder, but you've done the world a service by ridding it of a blackmailer and his informers.
the police will be here any minute. - Why? Nobody's called them.
you mean...? - That's right!
I suggest we stack the bodies in the cellar, lock it, leave quietly one at a time and pretend none of this ever happened.
great idea! I'll leave first, if you don't mind.
be my guest. In fact, I think we all owe you a vote of thanks.
for she's a jolly good fellow For she's a jolly good fellow
for she's a jolly good fellow
which nobody can deny
which nobody can deny Which nobody can deny
for she's a jolly good fellow For she's a jolly good fellow
for she's a jolly...
I said I didn't do it! - What if the authorities find out?
the FBI will take care of that. - You mean...
mr Hoover? I work for him, of course. How else could I know all about you?
one thing I don't understand. - One thing?
who was bribing Mrs Peacock?
a foreign power. Her husband handles defence contracts.
will there be a cover-up? - Yes, what's to be gained by exposure?
do the FBI clean up after multiple murder?
Yes. Why do you think it's run by a man called Hoover?
Mrs Peacock?
how did you know my name? - The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.
OK, take her away.
take your hands off me. I'm a Senator's wife!
Wadsworth, we got her.
see? Like the Mounties, we always get our man.
Mrs Peacock was a man?
would anyone care for fruit, or dessert?
didn't mean to frighten anyone. - Bit late for that!
then three more murders. - So who did it?!
let's consider each murder one by one.
professor Plum, you knew Mr Boddy was still alive.
even psychiatrists can tell if patients are alive or dead.
you fired the gun in the dark, missed, and pretended he was dead.
you were able to kill him later, unobserved.
he was missing in the kitchen when we found the cook.
he was with us when we found Yvette, so how did he kill the cook?
I didn't. - Expect us to believe that?
I expect you to believe it. You killed the cook.
she informed on you to Mr Boddy. You made one mistake.
sitting here, Mrs Peacock said she was eating one of her favourite recipes.
and monkeys' brains, though popular in Cantonese cuisine, are not often found in Washington DC.
Colonel, when we saw the motorist at the door, you took the key to the cupboard and suggested we split up.
you left Miss Scarlet, crossed the hall, opened the cupboard, took the wrench, entered the lounge, killed the motorist with a blow.
like that!
this is incredible! - Not compared to what happened next.
I went upstairs with you, Mrs White.
and, while I was in the master bedroom, you hurried downstairs, turned off the electricity, got the rope, and throttled Yvette.
you were jealous of your husband and Yvette so you killed him, too.
Yes.
Yes, I did it. I killed Yvette.
I hated her so much...
it, it... flames...flames on the side of my face...
breathing, breath, heaving breaths...
while we were in the billiard-room, Miss Scarlet crossed to the library, and hit the cop she'd been bribing with a lead pipe.
true or false? - True. Who are you? Perry Mason?
mr Green must have shot the singer. - I didn't!
there's nobody else left. - I didn't do it.
the gun is missing. Whoever's got the gun shot the girl.
I shot her. - You?!
I was going to expose you.
I choose to expose myself. - Please! Ladies present.
you thought Mr Boddy was dead. Why? None of you had met him before.
you're Mr Boddy!
wait!
who did I kill? - My butler.
Oh, shucks.
he was expendable, like you.
I'm grateful to you for disposing of my informers.
saved me the trouble of destroying the evidence.
this has nothing to do with my nuclear physicist husband or Colonel Mustard's work with the fusion bomb?
no, Communism was just a red herring.
the police are coming. You'll never get away with it.
why should the police come? Nobody's called them.
you mean... - Oh, my God! Of course!
why shouldn't we escape? Put the bodies in the cellar, leave quietly and forget any of this ever happened.
and you'll go on blackmailing us. - Of course, why not?
well, I'll tell you why not.
good shot, Green.
very good.
you a cop? - I'm a plant.
a plant? Men like you are called fruits. - Very funny.
FBI. That call from J Edgar Hoover was for me.
I told you I didn't do it.
all right. Who done it? - He did it.
that gentleman... - No!
they all did it.
but if you wanna know who killed Mr Boddy, I did.
in the hall, with the revolver.
OK, Chief. Take 'em away. I'm going home to sleep with my wife.
mom! Jethro's eating my underwear!
here, piggy, piggy, piggy. Jethro.
mom, before she starts, there isn't a shred of evidence - to support her allegations. - Gillian, your son is a psycho.
he booby-trapped my hair dryer. - Nice hypothesis, but you can't prove it.
Yeah, but I can hurt you. - Mom! Mom! She needs to be medicated.
come on, Jethro. - Come here.
I hate this family. Come here.
Jethro, you're getting a time out.
come on, guys. Backpack.
what? It's in style. - It's inappropriate. Go put on some jeans.
and spit out the gum.
so, what color do you want to wear today?
red? Blue? Purple?
pink, Momma, pink.
Farren. - What? You said jeans.
I meant in your size.
come on, guys. Come on. We don't want to be late. There you go.
come on, sweetie.
No! - Get out!
no fighting.
allow me.
are we still on for dinner? - I'll be there.
we have an audience.
Yuck. I'm going to vomit. - He is such a loser.
I like Bob. He's nice.
he's a boring pen importer. He does the same routine every day.
he's like a robot. - That's cause he is a robot.
a cyborg, sent from the future, to destroy humanity. Starting with us.
well, it's been three months. Happy anniversary.
what is it?
I have to tell you about my job.
this might shock you, but you should know everything before this relationship goes further.
don't, Bob. - What?
I'm very happy when I'm with you.
no one has ever made me laugh like you do, and if I were a single woman, I could see a real future for us.
but I'm a package deal.
what do you mean?
my kids are my priority and... How can I put this gently?
they hate me. - Yeah.
I can make them like me. - See?
you can't make kids like you, not mine or anyone's.
my kids have been through a lot, and...
I don't think we should take the next step until they warm up to you.
doesn't your happiness count?
excuse me.
sorry, I gotta go. Emergency at work.
no ink? - It's much bigger.
sorry, really. I will explain everything tomorrow.
okay. I'll see you tomorrow.
what took you so long to get here? - Six minutes.
you stop for a latte? - I get it. You're...
what's the expression? Chopping my bust. - Close enough.
Poldark and a couple other Russkys just went in the refinery.
then I was right. He's planning something.
maybe they just want to fill up their gas tanks for free.
I couldn't blame them. - No, that man's so crooked, he could eat nails and poop corkscrews.
you're the world's foremost authority on Poldark.
what do you think he's up to?
if his mission is to sabotage the world's oil reserves, why would he care about some two-bit refinery like this one?
I'll make sure you get a chance to ask him.
how the heck are you going to get in there? A jet pack?
it's in the shop.
wait for my signal.
Yuri.
what's this? - C-4.
when we are done here, I want you to blow this place to smithereens.
hurry up. I don't have all day. There is no overtime here.
Bob Ho.
I would love to chat, but I gotta go.
up there. Go, go, go, go. - Move it.
move. - Hold it. Stay where you are.
that was fun. A good aerobic workout.
we should do this again sometime.
okay, Poldark, let's go.
we have suspect in custody.
did you see the look on Poldark's face, man?
brilliant work, Bob. Unbelievable.
I really hate to see you go home. You're the best agent I've ever had.
Hey, you know I'm standing right here.
maybe I can get your government to loan you to me just a little bit longer.
no. This was my last assignment. I'm retiring.
don't tell me because of Gillian. - I want a normal life. I want to get married.
Oh, heck, man. Don't get married.
just find some woman that you're going to hate in five years and give her your house.
keep the watch. A memento, compliments of the CIA.
so, Gillian? Is that the woman that lives next door to your cover house?
Yeah, they've been stepping out. - I could never give up this life for a woman.
we're spies, man.
every little boy wants to be a spy. It's the life.
all the hours you spend sitting alone in a little room like this, eating cold take-out food in the back of a surveillance van, getting shot at all the time, learning how to pee in a bottle in a moving vehicle.
you're doing the right thing. - Only problem is that her kids hate me.
you the man.
really gonna miss you, Ho. Good luck with those kids.
I've brought down dictators. How tough can three kids be?
come on, Ringo, come on. - Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
Ringo! - Don't worry. Come on. Come on.
come on. Right here. - Come on, Ringo.
come on, Ringo. - Ringo.
Hi, kids.
I'm sorry about running out last night.
it's all right. It's your job. - No, it was rude.
I promise it will never happen again.
mom, what about Ringo?
we've tried everything, sweetheart. He'll come down when he's ready.
you want to see what I've been working on?
sure.
Ringo, Ringo! Come on, kitty. It's not that far.
please, please, please, Ringo.
there you go.
so, what do you think? - Well...
it's a work-in-progress.
sadly, I didn't have any time to work on it today.
cat was on the roof, satellite's broken again.
I spent two hours on hold trying to get a repairman out here, and I can't stop thinking about last night.
so, are we okay?
I understand.
if a man marries you, he marries all four of you.
don't forget the pig, the cat and the turtle.
so, do you really like it?
it frightens me.
sometimes I think I found the last honest man left in the world.
I brought you all cookies.
yes? - Is it true? You're going to marry Bob?
what? Whoa! Calm down. - You can't do this, Gillian.
you're, like, so far above him.
what she means is he's boring. He's a geek.
he's a very nice man who treats me very well.
he's a pen importer. - He's a cyborg.
you all don't know him like I do.
he's very passionate about the world and about my art.
he likes to talk about history, science and politics.
I see what you mean about him not being boring.
what you all call boring, I call dependable.
for once, I'd like a man who goes to work every day at the same time, and who comes home every single night.
a man who doesn't lie, or cheat, or leave his family the first time some...
my happiness counts, too.
I hate it when old people have feelings.
we gotta deep-six Bob.
what's the story here? - They hit Poldark's prison transport caravan - at the edge of town. - Tell me he didn't get away.
he's as gone as rum cake at an AA meeting.
I'm telling you, this whole thing was a setup.
they knew he was coming.
are you saying there's a mole in the agency?
I'm not saying anything except he got away.
welcome back.
Tatiana, you can't imagine what it's like in there.
the oppressive darkness and the torture of empty days stretching for years.
prison is hell. - You were in there for four hours.
enough tearful reunion.
I need a new batch of the formula as soon as possible.
we'll run another test in two days.
I need a change of clothes. Something current and fashionable.
and something to eat that does not come with a toy.
honey, we're getting ready to carve pumpkins downstairs.
you want to join us? - Absolutely!
cause I'm a loser and I have no life.
did I mention we're going to toast the pumpkin seeds?
come on. I want you to join the family.
and I want some privacy.
don't get fresh with me. - I'll use whatever tone of voice - I want to use with you. - Farren, I want you downstairs...
no, I'm not going to come downstairs right now. Get out.
Farren, this is my house. You will listen to me.
you don't own me. Get out. I said, get out, Gillian. Get out!
downstairs in five minutes.
I hate this house. I hate this family. Get out!
no, she won't hear me. I'm on the roof.
it's like the only place I can get any privacy in this loony bin.
I can't let Gillian marry this guy.
no, it's not that. I mean, you're right, he is a total drone, but that's not the issue.
what's going to happen when my dad comes back?
he won't just leave me here alone. He'll be back.
and if she's married, what happens then? I don't know.
mom, lan's feeding Jethro bacon.
okay, that's just wrong. - Why is it wrong?
ho, Bob Ho. - Hey. So, how's it going with those kids?
I'm taking Gillian and the children on a picnic.
I'm going to force those kids to like me.
force them? You know, you might as well try scratching your ear with your elbow.
guess what? Poldark escaped.
no longer my problem. - Yeah, I know, but we recovered a file.
it seems to be an entry portal to a website.
we can't crack it. I thought maybe you could take a look at it.
Hey, if you can figure it out, great. If you can't, no harm, no foul.
as a favor to you. Send it to my home computer.
already did.
while I'm thinking about it, they suspect there may be a mole at the agency.
they suspect me? - No.
you know Glaze thinks you're the sharpest barb on the wire.
I have no idea what that means.
Hey, listen, man, have fun on your picnic.
just shoot me back when you check out that file. Thanks.
puzzle encryption. Let's see what you've got.
is it noon already? - No. I have bad news.
my father is in the hospital. - That's terrible.
he plays senior softball and he slid into third.
now he's having his hip replaced. - That's terrible.
I have to leave the kids and fly to Denver to take care of Dad.
that's great. - What are you talking about?
let me watch the kids.
it would give us a chance to get to know each other.
no, Bob. You? Them? I don't know.
my aunt's flying in from San Antonio. She's very good with the kids.
she was in the military. - Gillian, this could be just what we need.
you really think you can handle that kind of pressure?
the driving, the schoolwork, and then there's Halloween.
getting their costumes, finishing decorating the house?
no problem. Halloween is my favorite.
you have nothing to worry about. They will be perfectly safe with me.
it's not them I'm worried about.
you can't be serious. - Isn't there any other option?
foster care? Juvenile hall?
okay. You'll be fine.
love you guys.
I'm going to miss you. - Yeah, as proven by this total abandonment.
you'll survive. I'll buy you something from the hospital gift shop.
Bye. - Bye. Love you.
see you later. - Bye.
so, is this exciting, or what?
well, I'll just pack a few things, and we'll go to your house, okay?
a Flowbee. I knew he cut his own hair.
nothing telling in his DVD collection.
standard action movies, mainstream comedies, no sci-fi, and nothing above PG-13.
Hey, his computer. Let's check it out.
good idea. There's got to be some dirt on there.
fashion Armageddon.
I haven't forgotten, Colton. I will look at the file.
but this is important. What is Halloween?
Farren, do you realize what this is?
it's got you all worked up. Let me guess, a Klingon dictionary?
you have me confused with an entirely different class of geek.
stockholm GBH.
grievous Bodily Harm, live in Stockholm.
this is one of the rarest bootleg concerts in the world.
why does Bob have it? - Who cares? I'm gonna download it.
this is my ticket to Coolsville.
this is what you bring me to wear?
you said you wanted current.
I look like the Fresh Prince of Belarus.
send someone out to get me something elegant.
what is this program you found?
I went on to download the formula and found the site being accessed by a third party.
if the United States or China has the formula, they can develop an antibody for it.
I'm tracing the ISP, but it's heavily encrypted.
it will take me a while to track it down.
find whoever downloaded my formula.
retrieve it. - And?
kill them. - Thank you.
what's up with you? - I'm gonna kill you.
what? I'm gonna kill you.
don't hurt me! Don't hurt me! She's hurting me!
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, stop!
what's going on here? - She threw a stink bomb in my room.
what? That's so not true.
so what, you're saying I threw a stink bomb in my own room just to get you in trouble? Sad. So sad.
Hey, hey, hey.
Farren, I'm very disappointed in you.
you two should be in bed by now.
well, if we finish our homework in time, Gillian lets us stay up till midnight.
she also likes us to watch Adult Swim. It's kind of a tradition.
I didn't really think this one through.
Nora, let's get ready for bed.
I don't want to go to bed.
only my mommy can dress me.
Nora.
here I come.
Hey! Come back. I'll get you.
come back!
I got you. No, come back!
Nora.
come on. Nora.
only my mommy can dress me. - Come on, Nora.
only my mommy can dress me!
only mommy can dress me!
you.
can your mommy do that? Sleep.
get out!
Hello? - You're alive. That's a good sign.
how are the kids? - We had a great night. Easy as pie.
Really? You're with my kids, right?
Bob, the other night at dinner, you were gonna say something about your job, and I cut you off.
you want to tell me now?
it can wait until you get back.
I really think this was a good idea. - I'm sure the worst is behind us.
just a second.
I got it.
fire!
big mistake.
everything will be fine. Oatmeal's ready.
shotgun. - It's not your day.
you sure your mother lets you go to school like that?
duh, Bob.
duh, Bob.
Bye. - Well, you guys have a nice day.
Hi. - That is so cute.
so what do you do all day?
nothing. I'm four.
you're full of it. - Yeah, full of it.
I'm telling you, I downloaded it yesterday.
Really? Cause if you really had, that'd be pretty cool.
Yeah, pretty cool. - Let's hear it then.
you trying to pop our ears? That's nothing but a bunch of static.
I don't get it. - I get it.
you're a pathetic little nerd and a liar. Let's get him.
wedgie!
put me down! Put me down! Put me down! Put me down!
okay, you asked for it.
No! You guys are gonna hear from me and my lawyer.
you'll pay for this, each and every one of you.
so, tell me more about Halloween.
it's the best. You get candy.
everyone pretends to be someone else, and nobody knows who you really are.
sounds familiar. Nora...
so, what do you want to be? A Frankenstein? A zombie?
sweetie, do you want to be a princess?
Yes.
okay, princess.
Nora?
not fairy. Princess. Princess.
princess.
pink.
pink.
princess. - It's too big.
too big? Okay.
Nora? Nora.
Nora.
Nora.
Nora.
Nora!
Nora. I'm sorry. Sorry. Sorry.
Nora!
Nora. Please don't wander off again.
I'm sorry, Bob.
let's go pay for your costume.
yo, it's Ho.
just hold him till I get there.
can I just say before we begin that only in the current distressed condition of the American public school system could I be deposited headfirst into a garbage can, and yet I'm the one who winds up receiving disciplinary action?
who exactly are you?
I'm his mother's...
neighbor. - Neighbor.
I'm watching them for a few days.
well, this is not the first time lan has been in trouble.
he gets in fights. He lies.
Hey, I don't lie.
you told everyone you invited Selena Gomez to the spring dance.
her appearance fee was an obstacle.
you said you spent New Year's Eve at the Playboy Mansion.
Hey, pay-per-view high-def. I felt like I was there.
I'm telling you, lying is a dangerous game.
Bob, you sell pens. What do you...
Oh, no. That's them. - Who?
the future felons who put me in the trash can.
Hey, geek-boy, we got detention because of you.
Yeah, because of you. - You're gonna pay for that.
gentlemen, we don't want trouble. - Who's this? Your mom?
you wish. He's my bodyguard. I hired him. You better watch out.
that true? - No. He's joking.
I'm their babysitter. - What are you gonna do?
ask you politely to allow us to pass.
how humiliating. Why didn't you do something?
why did you tell them I was your bodyguard?
you're right. I guess it was too big a stretch.
Hey. How you doing? I'm lan.
if I told you, you had a beautiful body, would you hold it against me?
at least you're not shy. - I wanted to talk to her in the worst way.
mission accomplished.
come here.
you look so pretty.
Farren, I didn't know you did gymnastics.
why would you? You don't know anything about me.
you come over to hang out with Gillian, and you never even talk to us.
come on, let's go.
the woman's got a point.
I don't know who you are sending out to buy my clothes, but I want them killed.
you could go yourself. - I'm the most wanted man in America.
I cannot exactly browse the racks of JCPenneys.
just give me something that will blend in. Something extremely American.
sir, we are ready to run the test.
magnificent.
she must have plastic in her shoes. It will eat any petroleum product.
we're working on that.
what happened to the bacteria?
they live as long as they feed. Once the oil is gone, they disappear.
just like my Jimmy Choos.
come in.
listen, about today...
you could have stood up for me, you know. I have to face those guys.
so face them.
unless you want to spend the rest of your life with your head in the trash can.
thanks for the advice, Bob. All my problems are solved.
they assign this in middle school?
no, that's my pleasure reading.
you're smart.
you have a lot going for you. Why do you make things up?
girls aren't exactly impressed by astrophysics.
given the resources, I could design, build and launch a rocket that would accurately circumscribe an orbit of the moon.
but other guys can, you know, throw a ball through a hoop.
I don't want you to get in trouble.
I'll make you a deal.
if you try to tell the truth from now on,
I won't tell your mother about today.
Really?
dude, that's almost cool.
you mean for a guy who sells pens?
come on, kids, time for bed.
come on, one more spoonful.
Nora.
this one I learned it in China when I was young.
it's me. I need your help.
I had to make up one heck of a yarn to get all this stuff.
what did you tell them?
well, let's just say if I don't find some weapons-grade uranium by dawn,
I'm in trouble. What do you need all this for?
to get the kids ready for school.
well, it's like my mom always used to say when she was stationed over in East Berlin.
she'd say, "Spying is easy. Parenting is hard." Good luck.
bring it on.
Farren, you've been in there all morning! Let me in!
Farren, let me in.
Farren, let me in.
Farren, you've been in there all morning! Let me in!
Farren.
Hey!
I guess it's my turn.
and, Farren, please put on a longer skirt.
this means war.
Nora?
Nora.
stay with Bob.
come on, Nora.
where is he? - Hiding.
he's probably going to trick us into opening the door.
help me put this away?
LAN. You know the rules.
no soda upstairs.
what? How did you...
breakfast is served.
Wow!
Nora, time for bed.
Night-night.
it's a school night. You should be asleep.
how'd you find me?
call it a hunch.
why do you call your mother Gillian instead of Mom?
she's not my mom.
what do you mean?
my father was married before, and my real mom died when I was little.
Gillian is just my stepmother.
and lan and Nora are just my half brother and sister.
I'm like the freak of the family.
it must have hurt your feelings when he left.
he'll be back for me.
I know he's not the greatest dad in the world, but he loves me, and he's not going to leave me here alone.
anyway, you should not climb the roof like this. It's not safe.
please don't tell me I can't come up here.
it's like the only place I can chill.
actually, I was going to offer to build you a railing.
are you trying to bribe me into liking you?
I just want you to be safe.
mind if I chill with you?
it's a free country.
look at the star.
good news. We got an address.
good. Take some men. Get that download back.
Tatiana.
no survivors.
Hey, boss. You like?
no like?
may I make a couple of fashion suggestions?
women don't like the shirt tucked in. Mess up your hair.
you know about fashion? - No, but I know women.
wear it like this. It's cool, I saw it in a movie.
what movie? Octopussy? This isn't 1985.
I almost forgot. - What's this?
iggy Pop and David Bowie in Shanghai. - What?
this is only about the hardest concert to find in the world.
I guarantee no one else in the school district has it.
you downloaded this for me? - Don't worry, I paid for it.
how'd you even know about it? - Easy. I was there.
Bob, you're getting too efficient. We're half an hour early.
you're welcome.
have a great day.
Hey, cool look, Aaron. - Thanks. It's lan.
whatever.
have a great day.
look, the talk on the roof the other night doesn't mean we're friends.
God forbid.
we're here. There is nobody around.
I found the computer, but the file was downloaded to an external storage device.
I can't find that.
I think I just figured out who lives here.
agent Ho.
hello. - You must stop shooting things, Antosha.
I said it would be bad if the CIA or Chinese had it.
but he's both. Find him, but keep him alive.
I need to know who else he's shown this to.
listen up. Now. Everyone in here.
we must locate Chinese Intelligence agent, Bob Ho.
he is very tricky. The best at what he does. He won't be easy to find.
ms. Creel. - Not now.
imagine you are Chinese, highly trained, and you want to disappear.
I see him climbing with a bunch of skulls on a rope.
okay, he's not Conan the Barbarian. Good try, though.
no, I see him. There.
go. Go!
don't kill him yet. We need information.
go, Bob, go! Go, Bob, go! Go, Bob, go!
come here, sweetheart. Get back here.
come here!
let go!
get the bad lady, Bob. - Let go!
can you hold my turtle? - Not now.
yay, Bob!
that's it.
you will pay for that, - little American princess. - Bob, help!
again, again, again.
okay.
why did you pull us out of school? - Who cares? We're out.
why are you in the front seat anyway? It's my day.
no, it isn't. It's my day. - No, it's not your day. You're the liar.
no, today is my day. - No, today is my day.
you're a liar. - No. No. No.
all right, quiet! - I'm still hungry.
it doesn't look like they have chicken tenders here.
wait inside. I have to make a call.
this is Firefly. - This is Bob Ho. I need help.
Yeah, so I get pretty good grades at this university.
I'm top of the class. I don't like to brag, but, you know.
Bob, this is Larry. - Pleased to meet you, sir.
let's get some food. - He goes to the university.
he's a poet. Isn't it cool?
it's rad. It's awesome. It's jiggy for shizzy. It's the bomb.
let's go. - Hey!
how embarrassing.
you know, most people don't like me when they first meet me.
but Larry did.
I have two words for you, Larry. Thirteen.
I have to go.
all right, Nora. Come on. You two stay at the table.
no, no, no.
I can't go in there.
boys are pigs.
careful.
and the lion jumped on me, and I killed him with my bare hands, and I saved the colonel's life.
you're brave. - Thanks.
how about this, Bob? The whole restaurant and the waitress sat Larry here.
isn't it great? - It's like it's fate or something.
really, sir, we're just goofing around.
Hey, Nora. Knock, knock. - Who's there?
irish stew. - Irish stew who?
irish stew in the name of the law.
Larry was telling me all about the university. It sounds great.
I'd be glad to give you a tour sometime. - When pigs fly.
it's not up to you. You're not my dad.
no, but I know that your mother hasn't completely lost her mind.
it's just a tour, Bob.
it's not like he's asking me out on a date or anything.
are you?
no, it's just a friendly offer.
even if it was a date, you still couldn't stop me.
what's your major, Larry? - English Lit.
would you pass the soy sauce?
that way I get a background in the classics.
you speak Russian, Larry? - What's going on?
this is going to be painful. - You're right about that.
go, go, go.
maybe you'll write a poem about this.
goodbye, Larry.
fine. He's too old for me.
Bob, I don't want to be a princess anymore. I want to be a cyborg.
how did he find us so fast? It doesn't make sense.
Bob, what's going on? - Please quiet, I'm trying to think.
what do you mean, you're trying to think?
you just threw a man out the window... - Who is he? What is...
all right, all right, fine. Fine.
I am international spy, on loan to the CIA from the Chinese Intelligence Service.
someone wants me dead, and "Larry" was a Russian operative, okay?
fine. Don't tell us.
cool.
why would he come alone?
stay here.
where are the kids? - Inside.
nothing else matters until these kids are safe. Nothing.
of course. Colton set up that safe house for them like you requested.
Hey, got that file on you? - What file?
the one Colton linked you to, from Poldark's computer, your download.
I didn't download it. I never even got it open.
don't BS me, Bob. It's classified material. I need all copies.
why would you think I downloaded it?
unless someone told you I had, someone who wanted it back.
let's not make this thing harder than it has to be, Bob.
give me the file.
you're a career officer. Why do this?
I want out. Same as you. We're both leaving for love.
only I love money and Anton Poldark is match. Com. The file.
wait. Take it easy.
good work.
no.
can I just say, you are by far the coolest guy my mom has ever dated.
at least now I know how that kid Larry found us so fast.
how? - The watch.
glaze told me to keep the watch. It must have a tracking device.
Wow. You really are a spy. - Gillian is totally going to freak.
what are you doing?
there's iron in these rocks. It will hide the signal. Watch, please.
you realize if I told anyone at school this story,
I'd get detention for a year for lying.
Yes. - Hey, partner. Where're you at?
why do you ask? - I needed to pick up that file I sent you.
you know, the one I wanted you to open for me.
Bob, you there?
Colton, I never thought you would have sold out to Poldark.
Hey, that's crazy, man. Something's wrong. We need to get together and talk.
nice try. - Bob? Bob?
we'll be safe here. I promise. - This is your plan? Hide out in a hotel?
doesn't look like they have chicken tenders here, either.
this is awesome. Can we order room service?
are you crazy? I'm going home. - No.
the only place you're safe is with me. - Safe with you?
everybody's trying to kill you. - I know. Isn't it cool?
Hey, Bob, if you want to marry my mom, I'll personally write the invitations.
love you, Bob.
be realistic, Bob.
hello. - Hi, Gillian.
Hi, sweetheart.
Yeah, Grandpa just fell asleep. I was gonna call you guys.
I have to tell you something.
I know this is going to hurt you, but I have to tell you.
are you all right? - I'm fine.
it's about Bob. - What about him?
he's not who you think he is. He's a spy, a Chinese spy.
and these terrorists are trying to kill him and now the CIA's after him, too, and they...
Farren, I know you don't like Bob, but come on.
I'd expect this from lan, but not from you.
what? No, it's true. He's going to get us all killed. Don't you even care?
Farren, this conversation is over. Put Bob on.
Hi, Gillian.
Bob, I am so sorry. I don't know what's gotten into her.
it's true. - What is?
everything she said is all true.
whatever this is, it isn't funny.
the kids are safe, I promise.
I'll give them to you as soon as you get back.
you're either telling me the truth or I've left my kids with a nut job.
either way, you should come and get them.
so, you got any other cool spy stuff, besides the watch?
don't touch. It's very sharp.
cool. What else?
cool.
sorry, mister.
airport. Step on it.
Bob? Are you awake? - Are you kidding?
does he always snore like that? - Can't you hear him next door?
I always thought it was the pig.
it's over with you and Gillian, isn't it?
Yes, Farren, it's over.
you win. - Then why don't I feel like I won?
if you really loved her, you wouldn't give up this easily.
it's because I love her and the three of you that I have to walk away.
it's more important that you're safe.
I thought I could put my other life behind me, but I can't.
be glad. You're lucky you're not joining this family.
you've no idea what it's like to live in a place where you totally don't belong.
don't be so sure. I was an orphan.
I was raised in a group home. I never knew my parents, but I had a family.
I had dozens of brothers and sisters there.
and I wasn't related to any of them, but I loved them all.
family isn't whose blood you carry.
it's who you love and who loves you.
Gillian! - Mom!
Gillian, I'm really sorry about everything.
tell me the truth. Are you really a spy?
Yes, I am. I was going to tell you at dinner, but you stopped me.
I don't care. You put my children in danger.
just go.
Bob, when are we going to see you again?
you're not.
please don't go away. Who's gonna sing me China songs?
you'll be safe. I promise. - Stay away from my children.
dear Mom, I am very sorry, but I cannot stay here.
my destiny is to be a spy, like Bob.
I am going with him. Best wishes, your son, lan.
ho's signal just popped back up. We got him.
let's roll.
Bob! Bob!
LAN. - You left your watch.
what are you doing here? Let's go.
what do you mean? We just got here.
Bob Ho. What a coincidence. Tie them up.
what are you doing here, lan? - I'm coming with you.
I want to be a spy, too.
is this the bad guy? I thought he'd be better dressed.
how did you find me? - I found one of your tracking devices and put it in your pocket when I hugged you goodbye.
I'm impressed. - Thanks.
can we go back to business? - Would it help to mention I'm retired?
retired men don't download secrets.
I never downloaded anything. - He's lying.
who are you going to believe? Me or the traitor?
someone has been a very naughty boy.
he's got cameras and microphones mounted all over the place.
good plan, filming us together.
how could you turn against your country? - It's simple.
I'm gonna be a billionaire.
that file that you didn't download? It's a formula for a Growth Bacteria Hybrid.
this stuff literally eats oil. Can you imagine?
overnight, all the world's oil supplies go poof.
all except for Russia's. It'll be priceless, right, comrade?
how did you get Colt to go along with you?
colt? That hillbilly's not part of this.
he doesn't know what goes on in the real world.
he still thinks wrestling is real.
let the boy go. He has nothing to do with this.
Mr. Chit-Chat just laid out our whole plan.
we cannot let him go.
he will tell. - Trust me, no one would believe him.
he's right about that.
Hey, boss. Look at what I found sneaking around outside.
Farren? - Hi, everybody.
please, have a seat.
this can't be happening.
Poldark, let the children go and I will find this GBH file for you.
GBH? Like, Stockholm GBH?
how do you know that? - No freaking way.
you're telling me all of this is because he downloaded a bootleg concert?
you did what?
you downloaded it?
wow, these companies take piracy way too seriously.
you were messing with my computer? That's private.
I just wanted to seem cool.
you don't need to. You are cool.
you're one of the coolest kids I know. - Really? Thanks.
Hey, over here. Man with a gun.
wait a minute. I am one of the only kids you know.
where is the file? - It's on my iPod, on my desk at home.
now, see, you want to be a spy. Never tell the truth to the bad guy.
sorry, I'm new at this.
Tatiana, take some men to the kid's house and find the iPod.
what if the family is home?
ever since you dyed your hair blonde... Kill them.
no, don't! - Go, bring me that iPod.
come on, go. Go.
now, as for you...
awesome!
Farren, let's go.
I call dibs on the front. - Then I pick the radio station.
okay. Ready?
okay, hold on.
Hello? - Gillian, listen to me.
goodbye, Bob.
Gillian, wait. Don't hang up.
hang on. We've got to get there before they do.
is there anyone at the agency you can still trust? Someone you can call?
sure, but they tore out my cameras. I have no proof of anything.
except that, as it happens, I recorded that entire conversation on my cell phone.
way to go, dork.
colt... Just listen. I'm going to play you something.
that file that you didn't download? It's a formula for a Growth Bacteria Hybrid.
this stuff literally eats oil.
what is this?
it's Halloween. - It's Halloween.
happy Halloween. - Bob!
what are you all doing? I thought you were upstairs.
everybody inside. - Bob, we need to talk.
mom, this isn't a joke. Do whatever he says.
okay. - Come on.
get your iPod. - His iPod?
I demand an explanation. - They're coming.
who? - The Russians.
Russians?
I saw them outside. They're coming.
Russians? - Yes, Gillian, Russians.
let's try and keep up.
it's too late. Everybody upstairs. Understand me?
stay there.
Where's my stuff?
here, take some of this stuff. - What is all this?
protection.
why do you have a lighter? I don't want you playing with fire.
okay, maybe just this once. Let's go.
trick or treat.
hurry. Close it. Close it quick. Okay.
I forgot Chuckle. - Nora! Nora!
what are you supposed to be?
a cyborg, sent from the future to blast you away.
mommy, that man can fly.
I can't believe you did this to my family, endangered my kids.
I didn't mean to. I love your kids.
I want to marry you, all four of you.
and I wanted to marry you.
but our wedding gifts would have to be opened by the bomb squad.
all right, Ho. Enough games.
I finally found a normal guy, I thought, someone who likes to...
can we talk about this later?
he switched belts. - Get him.
give me the iPod, kid.
come on, let's TP the little geek's house. - Yeah, TP.
Hey, guys.
gotta go.
maybe we should just stick to stealing candy from little kids.
Yeah, real little kids.
this is going to be fun. - Hey, Larry. Knock, knock.
Yes!
come on, guys, get in the room and lock the door. Hurry. Lock it.
irish stew in the name of the law.
sorry your retirement was so short, Bob.
you can kill me. Let the family go. - I can't. They've seen too much.
but I'll let you go first so you don't have to watch.
Hey, mister.
don't think this changes anything.
everybody freeze! - It's okay.
they're the good guys.
you stinking lowlife. Come on. Let's go.
mom!
Hey, loosen these things up.
I'm sorry. What's wrong? Got the handcuffs too tight?
I don't know how these things work. I'm just a dumb hillbilly.
everybody okay? - Bumps and bruises.
LAN, this really is the good guy.
Hey, what you got there, son?
nice work recording that conversation, partner.
this young man might make a heck of a spy someday.
how quickly can you give me orange jumpsuit?
I'm sorry I suspected you.
don't worry about it, old buddy.

magistrate, development, whatever.
I'm sorry. Really.

it's not because of you, nor anyone else.
I just don't want to be in this position.
I knew it was going to be bad, but not this bad.
Hey, you were showing off like that, and know you're backing off?
huh?
Hey, don't talk to me like that!
why does my mother have to suffer like that?
she's been living all her life, looking up at me, you know?

I'm the asshole.
so I want to set things right.
for you, and you mother.
that's what I feel right now.

it sucks to be outwitted from people like that!
you're nothing different, what have you got to say?
don't talk to me like that.
you're done like this, but what about me, huh?
I've accomplished nothing in my life.

let me deal with that. That's what friends are for.
let's go.

I'm the president, what will he do, beat me?
you steal things, and consider yourself the president?

when 3 thousand stood together to fight
we all stood together.
hello.
I risked my life till yesterday, to stop them from building a nuclear waste center.
I'm JO Choonsam, village chief of Sanchon.
the reason I stand before you,
Kangduk county, criticized for its arbitrary decision to build a nuclear waste center, has finally announced today that it will settled by vote.
lee Junghoon reports.
magistrate NOH's bribe case is clearly a conspiracy.
we wouldn't have to deal with this if we had gotten rid of him.
I hope that the magistrate doesn't torment himself for that...
get rid of him? What are we, crooks?
I told you that we shouldn't trust him.
now look what's happening?
we didn't squeeze him hard enough.
when the bluff's weak, someone will still call with a one pair.
we need to raise the stake.
do you realize how much we put in already?
Hey! - Yes, sir.
you! - Yes, sir.
ask for another loan tomorrow.
how much?
as much as possible.
now they're bringing the barmaids into play.
bribing like crazy.
sick bastards.
there are things that we can't overcome, you know.
Yeah, but I recently saw a research survey...
don't use that expression when you're with others.
you sound dumb.
what do you mean?
what's a survey? You do it for research.
it's unnecessary repetition of words with similar meanings.
Hey, everyone knows what I mean when I say research survey, it's like that Gallop poll thing...
it's like saying, 'completely eliminate'.
Yeah, yeah. And you're so smart.
small in size.
okay, okay. So I was saying...
dash quickly.
okay, dammit!
Why're you shouting at me for? I was only trying to help you.
you're still the mighty stubborn ass that you were a long time ago.
only trying to be resourceful...
let's just do our best, okay?
sorry, sir. We've been talking to ourselves.
Oh, you shouldn't call me sir...
he's the same age, man.
college alumni.
what alumni? He looks old enough...

must've taken the wrong medicine when you were young.
okay, here's to our victory. - Victory!
we will now start counting the ballots.
you may unseal the boxes.
why did you call?
what's the rush? Let's have a drink.
right. - Come sit over here.
it's because I know. - Know what?

I was going to fire back
Tommy, you're still standing and most important is I'm still standing too
that's the way it goes, don't worry about that
thank you, Sir
officer Li, it's bad they raided our distribution point
sir
I think I've got something here
open it up for me
now we got a case
trafficking in dangerous drugs
this is piggybacking
what is piggyback?
this is all about, you see, the VCDs shipment got their destination
they just piggy back the drug along with it, and they get a 2 for 1 deal
now we've got some exciting things to work on, gentlemen
let's go to work
let's go
officer Li
now just make sure they blue tag everything and look after here
Yes, Sir
officer Li
what brings you here?
heard you had some kind of trouble so what's happening?
well, just a VCD raid with the boss dead some guys come out and shoot
so I double tapped
so why gun plays with the VCDs?
well, it wasn't just VCDs we found 20 blocks of heroin in there
heroin?
yeah
OK, who tipped you here?
come on, CK, you know I can't tell you about my connections
not everyone is that honest, you'd better be careful in future
Hey, look, we've just found a suitcase with heroin in there and I want to know where it comes from
now I am doing my job
he, I've lost much money again
I know what I am doing
I know, you're working but I repeat

seems like he has one of the files help up
he had his probationary inspector signed if off
he did? - Yes
you knew?
we got a file before it was destroyed
so what's it used to?
we're not sure
it seems like he's working with the triad in Mongkok
yeah? I don't think so, not with CK
miles, I'm sorry
sorry for what?
we have to look into your background as well
Why? What for?
because you just transferred to Mongkok and you and CK were friends
so what do I check out? Am I clean?
why didn't you tell me this before?
you know I couldn't
so you and they check up my record of service and look behind my back and all this?
I'm not quite sure what's going on here
why are we here tonight? For your work?
or for relationship? What's going on?
are we here because you're trying to find some more information or we're
no, of course not
look, I don't appreciate that
now make up your mind what you're doing?
don't forget to check my records and do all that stuff and do that, make sure it's business
and don't get me involved in anything else
Miles...listen to me
who is it?
Hello, Officer Ma, Officer Chin says his phone runs out of battery
he wants you to find him at a bar in TST for something urgent
did he leave any details?
no, he didn't
I'm on my way
officer Li, that girl is waiting for you in the room
you know what you are to do?
yes
you'll free me after I do this?
but you must never show up in my district

what about the nails?
OK

I'll do a body check for you
just relax, let me ask you a few questions
have you had oral sex with him?
no . no
have you taken a bath afterwards?
no . no
OK, I'll examine your nails

then we'll check your Virginia see if he has left any hair
we'll also check wounds on your body
take a rest now
I need some blood and urine samples
OK . OK
have you got all your clothes?
all are here
OK
officer Cheung . what is it?
a girl reports, saying she's been raped and assaulted
she's a prostitute, severely wounded when she came here
what else?
she said our guy did it
what do you mean our guy?
a policeman did it
where is she now?
the doctor is doing a body check for her and getting the physical evidence
we may go in soon
is she our rape specialist?
Yeah, come with me, you stay here
Yes, Sir
I'm Chief Inspector Cheung of Mongkok
sorry but I must ask you some questions
do you remember the whole thing?
I think I can
do you recognize him?
Yes, I do
have you seen him before?
yes
where?
in Mongkok Police Station
you were arrested once with him?
he works there
what do you mean?
he's a policeman
a CID
you know his name?
I call him Miles
he's very tall
miss, this is a serious charge
are you sure?
I'm sure
I'm sure he beat me up and raped me
he says he loves beating women and SM
he's also a policeman, so you'll help him
miss, we're police
if there's enough evidence we will arrest just anyone
take a rest
has she been raped?
I can only say she's been beaten up and had sexual intercourse
the bruises on her neck show she's been strangled
I think 15 to 20 seconds more and she'd have died
thanks
ask that girl again when she wakes up get details
Yes, sir
I must call up my boss, when she learns this, she'll surely black out
is it News Division?
right, New Division
I have news for you
what is it?
tomorrow a senior police officer will be arrested
who?
miles Ma, Chief Inspector of Mongkok
where?
at his home in Causeway Bay
what time?
in about an hour
what did he commit?
rape and attempted murder
who is it?
dicky Cheung, CIP of Mongkok
I have something to ask you
mind if we come in?
Yeah, sure come on in
officer Ma, where were you last night?
in here
last night a girl reported that she had been raped and assaulted
you want me to be in charge of this case
she said you raped her
she said I did it?
she knows your name your position and your figure
officer Ma, where exactly did you go last night?
I went out with my girlfriend
what time did you return home?
at around 11 pm
did anyone see you?
the doorman downstairs? I don't know
you're also policeman, you know the procedures
you must come to the station with me
give me five minutes
miles, it's me, Lian Miles
you want to arrest me?
right, you needn't speak anything but anything you say will be taken as testimony to court
So...handcuff me
there they come
is this officer Ma?
he's the officer of Mongkok Police Station
why the hell are the press?
this is Hong Kong, Get in the car
you need a lawyer
look, I'm innocent, I don't need a lawyer
where were you from 11pm to 1 am
well, I was having a stroll with my friend
what friend?
I'd rather not say
were you with a prostitute last night?
of course not
we all know you're dating with Janis Chan
you'd better admit it
Jesus Christ, come on, what is this? You know all my business?
officer Ma you may face serious charge
the preliminary evidence doesn't seem good to you
such as what?
I'll tell you later, now tell me
were you with Janis Chan last night?
Yeah, I was with her
and then?
then I received a call from Tommy Chin
he asked me to meet him at a bar
then what?
I don't know
how did you get the bruises on your hand?
I forget to tell you
when I got to the bar, two guys were there
they picked a fight with me
the guys pushed me and I hit them back that's it
you're policeman, did you report the fight?
and what about the wounds
and what about the wounds
look, that's how it happened
OK, it's that simple
I'm telling you the truth, we got a fight and that's all I remember
officer Ma, heard about the guy we found yesterday afternoon?
what guy?
someone found a guy, with your name card on him
the boy who sells VCDs
right, he got chopped up
did he die?
no, but in critical condition
officer Ma, it's not your day
Tommy, did you give me a call last night?
no, I was busy working all night
what happened?
some girl says I raped her
did you do it?
of course not
look, they took DNA samples
once they do the test, they'll realise that I didn't do it
cheung found the boy we talked to on the street the other day
the VCD boy?
they found the boy chopped up had my card taped to his forehead
the guys working for Kwok?
right
you got to get up and find out what's going on, start digging around
when you find out something, come back, let me know
OK, yes, sir
take care
miles, how are you doing?
Hello, Charles, good to see you
good to see you
thanks for coming, so what you think?
well, I took a look at the preliminary report and the evidence they've gathered so far
got to tell you, doesn't look good
just give it to me straight, Charles would you?
OK, looks to me like you're scooped
that's bullshit, you know I didn't rape anybody, come on
the OC case, the SIP named Cheung doesn't believe a word you said during your interview
I bet the guy wants to see you swing
he's put on a request to deny all ball and got to tell you, Miles they're going to charge you with attempted murder
attempted murder?
Yeah, the girl was strangled
the pathologist's report states another 15 to 20 seconds, she'd have been dead
what about the DNA evidence?
that would help us with the rape case seems it won't do anything for attempted murder
madam, OK, no problem, yes
Hello, yes...he's in, thanks
I shouldn't be here but I want to see you and I needed to know, did you do it?
of course not
you think I'll rape and beat some girl?
I have to ask
why are you still being held?
because the OC case Cheung is a real asshole
he won't approve bail on any ground
what do you think happened?
I was set up obviously
you must have offended someone
Yeah, to say the least
whoever set me up sure knows a lot of DNA cause he's covered everything
I'll use my contacts at the Government
lab to speed up the DNA testing
I know the chemist, she owes me a favor
thanks
I didn't do it
the DNA should prove, right?
is there anything I can do?
just help me get out of here
come in
I've done what I should
much better than I expected
much more than you expected
since you say so, those cops won't bother me again?
right
good, anything else?
I want to cooperate with you
what benefits will I have?
the more I am involved, the more protection you'll get
then there'll be no more trouble
good
long time no see, how are you?
not bad, thanks
how is it
I want to ask a favour from you
OK, just tell me
can you speed up the testing of the DNA samples sent from Mongkok this morning?
the rape case of CIP Ma?
right
no problem
thanks
you're welcome, I still owe you a favour
you mustn't say so
come with me
thanks
is this the fastest already?
Yes, it's the fastest
we'll get the result in 2 to 3 hours
you know what to do? Be smart
Hey, tell Officer Ma, that guy is called Tung
sir, someone wants to see you inside
who is it? I don't know
you know him? No, I don't
OK, thanks
who are you?
what do you want?
is the result out yet?
sorry, Janis, positive, the two patterns coincide
I have the results
I know
how can it be true?
did you check the samples? Were they tampered with?
it was signed and sealed when they were opened
I double checked them myself at the lab once I knew the results
they set me up but Tommy Chin called, he said Tung
tung was the guy who had the young boy chopped up
he could have set me up, Janis
you believe me, don't you?
I don't know what to believe
Tommy Chin is dead
what?
we found him early this morning in an alley, shot to dead
Oh no, Not Tommy
your Worship, this is a serious case as be seen from the facts
the defendant has been charged with rape
the Police request that the defendant to be returned to police custody for further action
your Worship, the defendant has maintained his innocence throughout the proceedings stating that he's been set up
he is a serving police officer with the HK Police Department and has an impeccable record
he lives in Government housing and has strong ties to Hong Kong
the prosecution's case is primarily circumstantial and with that I apply for and expect to be granted an immediate bail
I agree with the prosecution
bail is denied this time
the defendant is remained into police custody for a further 72 hours
I want this case bring back in front of me next Monday
that will be all
now local news
a Chief Inspector of Mongkok has been arrested
he is charged with rape and attempted murder
he was taken to court this morning
the defendant need not answer
the magistrate denied bail as of the seriousness of the case
he's been put under Police's custody waiting for next Monday
miles, how are you doing?
how do you think I'm doing, Charles?
I went to the Court of First Instance and I applied of bail on your behalf
And?
they upheld the Magistrate's decision and turned it down
so what's next?
we'll wait, we're going to the trial in about 3 days
let's see what happens then
that's crazy, I did nothing wrong and I'm stuck in this shit hole
Charles, this is Janis Chan
this is my lawyer, Charles
nice to meet you, Miss Chan
nice to meet you too
what is it that you do?
I work for internal Investigation Office
that's right
we're dating
I see
let's get back to it
you hear about Tommy?
Yes, I did, I'm sorry
Tommy Chin, one of my inspector was shot and killed
I'm sorry, Miles
miles, the evidence is overwhelmingly against you
I agree with her
is there anything you can tell us, Miles, that can help?
look, I went through it all, it's all I got, I've told you everything
is there anything else you can remember? Anything at all
Janis and I were together, right
I got a call from Tommy
well, it wasn't Tommy, it was somebody else on his behalf told me to meet him at the bar
just before I got there, I got a fight with a couple of guys
I never seen them before, the guys pope in and got me with a big fight
I got in the bar, and that's the last thing I remember
next morning I waked up, guys were calling on my door and arrested me for rape and attempted murder
now I don't know what happened that night, just like whole period was blacked out
so I think somebody drugged me
Yeah, that's about to explain it all
wait, that's pretty hard to believe
Yeah, I agree
alright, you said Tung, a triad
how would they know how to plan DNA?
yeah
you said it yourself, you said CK was working with some triad of Mongkok
if anyone who knows how to do DNA stuff, it's CK Li
he's been trained for, he knows the whole procedure
now, I'm telling you, CK set me up
sorry for bothering you again
I must treat you to dinner
anything new findings?
we can eat dinner later, come and take a look
how come?
what is it?
nothing, but seldom does a rapist wear a condom
what?
I said the rapist seldom wore a condom
how come you know?
look, the two slides show different patterns
this reveals the blood sample collect from the victim contains a spermicide found in condom
I need a copy of this testing result
OK, I'll make it for you at once
we've found something
what's that?
there was a spermicide in your semen sample spermicide that comes only in condoms
it could be evidence that the semen was planted in the girl
you doubted me, didn't you?
I don't think it's enough to reverse the charge but I think it may be enough evidence to question to the result
thanks for believing in me
like I told you, I care about you
Hey, Bill
there're still some more, take your time
Thanks, I want these
what a stance
we did a complete element scan on the semen sample and that's where we find the spermicide
your Worship, we believe there's new evidence is testimate to my client's contingent that the semen as well as the other physical evidence is part of a conspiracy to frame a good and respected senior officer of HK Police Department
Oh, you do?
your Worship, may I remind all of you that girl is no ordinary young girl
of course she isn't
she's in fact a prostitute
that has no relevance to this
well, I disagree, this case is relevant to it
so what do you say?
because this girl is a prostitute, she can be raped?
I'm not saying that at all
this girl is a prostitute, a quite busy one
she had sex with seven men the day that she was raped by CI Ma
that has nothing to do with this
each time she had sex she used a condom with spermicide
I would say that at anytime she should have enough spermicide in her body
that could easily be found in a scientific examination, would you all agree?
prosecution, this is a strong case
so how did it go?
they shot it down
they shot it down, why?
they said the girl had sex with 7 people before she had sex with you
I tell you, I never had sex with her
alright, Miles, take it easy, alright, I'm sorry
so you're saying she had the spermicide in her already?
that's exactly what they are saying
so?
so now we'll wait for trial
trial?
I did nothing wrong
now, you're supposed to be watching for corruption
you're supposed to be watching people like CK
so what is wrong if I do the job
Janis, what's the result?
nothing special
he's still in custody with charge of rape and attempted murder
no evidence to prove of his innocent, that's all
so you believe he did that?
I don't
but I can't do anything of help
madam, there's some findings in the video tape
I'll take a look later
madam, you must want to see it
Hey, any findings?
madam, just then Paparazzi of ICAC sent this tape around and I've found something in it
what is it?
I want three copies at once, the sooner the better
Yes, Madam
Hello, Charles, this is Janis Chan
I need to meet you at the Magistrate's
court in an hour, can you do that?
I have something to show you
all right, see you then
miss Chan
yes
I suggest you pick up Mr. Li as soon as possible
Yes, Your Worship
and I suggest, no, I insist you research more formal professional in the future
I expect a higher evidence called, is that clear?
Yes, Your Worship
thank you, Your worship
they asked me to do this
who asked you to do this?
which Boss Tung
who is Boss Tung?
I don't know, I saw that officer go into the alley and there was a shot
I didn't know they would kill him
I only did what they told me to
who do you work for?
I've just said, the triad bosses
OK
tell me from the beginning again
I've repeated lots of times already
they wanted me to make it as if Inspector Ma raped me and I don't know anything else
I've to you everything already
officer Ma
welcome back
thank you
they find out the guy's name is Tung, he's the one who killed Tommy
Joe, I want you to find them keep a track on, let's know where he is
Yes, sir
the rest of you, I want you to stand by here
what about CK?
I want to take care of CK, don't worry about that
you guys carry on
Yes, Sir
Hey, Miles, what took you so long?
what do you mean what took me so long?
I've just got out the fucking jail for Christ sake
want a cup of tea?
no, I don't want some tea
I want you to tell me why I've got out jail
all right, I had to do what I did or Kwok would send somebody to chop you up, just like the boy or I wouldn't have got close to him
I spend 2 nights in jail, I was convinced for rape
I am a police officer for Christ sake
why you frame me rape?
look, I've been following them for weeks
I know all their movements, I know where the drugs are
but Tung is a mistake, there's nothing to do with me, it's Tung who killed Tommy
OK, so where's the drugs are?
if you still trust me, we can move on
I know exactly where they are, I'm just waiting for you
you'd better not be lying to me?
you're supposed to be my friend
I'm still your friend, with me or not?
relax, Dicky, I got it under control
take it easy, Miles, I called him
you knew about this?
I just fond out
well, shall we?
did you know about the video tape in the massage parlour?
Hey, you are not supposed to tell
miles, let's go
come on
shit, Jesus Christ
we'll split into 3 teams and arrest them
remember, our target man is cunning
you'd better be careful
officer Ma has something to supplement
I just keep a brief, everyone know t there's been some interesting events some folding in the last month and we know now we realize they're all connected
ask CK points out, the gentleman here known to us as Tung
we know and have confirmed have evidence that this guy killed Tommy Chin, one of our people
and that is unacceptable, nobody kills a HK Police Officer
this guy is going to trash, that's where he belongs
let's move out
Yes, Sir
you're 20 minutes late

assistant?
he's with me, don't worry

OK, take the boss for a ride
OK, enjoy yourselves
Thanks, Man. Welcome
Bye. OK, see you
alright
that is a special tour for you today
Mayday, mayday. This is Hesper 2-9-9, heavy in distress.
dad!
engines 1 and 2 are offiline. We're losing her.
go! Go!
I've heard stories of Earth.
a paradise...
until we destroyed it.
the founding of the Uniting Ranger Corps, One thousand years ago was a global military effort, in evacuation of earth.
the rangers would lead the settlement of mankind in its new home.
Nova Prime.
but we were not alone.
the aliens released the Ursas.
monsters. Bred to kill humans.
technically blind.
the Ursas see humans based on the pheromones secrete when frightened
they literally smell our fear.
humankind was again in danger of extinction, and again turned to the rangers for the answer.
and that answer came in the form of the prime commander Cypher Raige.
the original GhosL
he's believed to be soul completely free of fear, that to an Ursa...
he's invisible.
this phenomena is known as "Ghosting."
this isn't a race, cadet.
Raige.
your test scores are very impressive.
ln the classroom you are an outstanding ranger, but in the field you collapse.
l'm not advancing you.
you may try again next year.
sir, l am dedicated, l've Studied and consistently displayed conduct becoming a ranger, sir.
l request that the commander reconsider his assessment sir.
cadet... - Sir, my father is returning home tonight.
l haven't seen him in...
lt's a very special day for our family.
and l've gotta be able to tell him that l'm a ranger, sir.
you tell your father...
that I said welcome home.
dismissed.
Faia.
Hi.
how were finals?
how were finals? - I wasn't advanced to ranger.
where do we look when we speak?
l was not advanced to ranger.
you were not advanced to rangerm
I was not advanced to ranger, sir.
that's all right, you're young...
l ran the canyons 11 seconds faster than you did.
you weren't ready.
Velan is a good man, he knows his stuff.
lf you were, he would've promoted you. You weren't ready.
l'm not hungry. I'm going to my room.
are you asking me or telling me?
may l go to my room, sir?
denied! Sit down!
our last visit to Iphitos...
flying tomorrow.
supervising training...
and after it's completed,
I'm announcing my retirement.
retirement?
maybe l'll work with you...
in Turbine division.
together.
l want my family back.
I want you back.
that boy in there...
is trying to find you.
he's a feeling boy.
he's an intuitive boy.
he watched you read that book with Senshi his entire Iife.
he's reading that book now.
he's reaching for you.
don't get me wrong,
I respect everything you've done.
but you have a son in the other room that...
who do not know.
he blames himself on what happened to Senshi.
he thinks it's his fault.
he's drowning.
and he does not need a commanding officer.
he need a father.
pack your bags. You're coming with me to Iphitos.
this was a rea‖y good decision.
now go and make some good memories together.
you take it easy on your father. He's a little rusty.
okay.
general Raige.
l was on the plateau.
you saved me and four others.
l just came from seeing my baby girl's face for the first time.
stand me up. - That won't be necessary, ranger.
damn it, stand me up!
watch left.
pull.
looks good.
l'm reading "Moby-Dick."
your mother told me.
that's great.
our military transporter will arrive training base on Iphitos in seven hours.
l'm gonna grab some rack time. l recommend you do the same.
Hey! Can you read?
I Said, can you read?
Yes, sir.
well, there's a sign back there:
authorized Personnel Only.
why didn't you read that?
what's in the cage?
might wanna go easy on him, Serge.
that's the Prime Commander son right there.
you're Raige's kid? - What's in there?
you wanna see?
kit, we have to go. Right now.
ls that... - They surprised us.
Senshi, abstract those things.
an Ursa? -Taking it to Iphitos.
for ghost training.
you wanna see if you can ghost?
ghosting is when you don't have a trace of fear in you.
most guys freeze.
that's your cerebral cortex looking for an answer it doesn't have.
see, even your brain knows you're screwed.
your blood is filling with adrenaline right now...
whether you know it or not.
your heart's beating fast.
lt's getting a little harder to breath.
your neurobiological system is telling you to run, but your knees are too weak to move.
and it's... too late anyway.
the pores in your skin have already opened up.
lt's secrete an imperceptible amount of pheromones into the air.
and all you can think about is when it gonna kill you.
Senshi!
she sees you, kid.
attention on deck!
Kitai, back to your seat now.
Rangers, go red-con one.
secure all cargo!
behind your seat there's a life-suit.
put it on now. Strap in, full harness. - Yes, sir.
good evening, General. - Captain.
what's the last known position of the closest asteroid storm?
Category-4 asteroid formation.
2, 000km to starboard and plus 4-5 declination.
I detected graviton-vibrations in the hull.
which you detected, how?
graviton build-up could be a precursor to mass-expansion.
that storm could be on us in minutes.
but, sir, mass-expansion is one in a million.
if we try to navigate out...
the pull of our own graviton wake could set the thing off.
let's just hold course and hope l'm wrong.
just out of interest, sir,
how often are you wrong?
my wife would give a very interesting answer to that question.
graviton count's decreasing.
800 pants per million.
well, sir, there's a first time for everything.
turn into it. Match bearing.
dad!
she's a dead stick!
engines 1 and 2 are offline. we losing her!
can you travel us out of here? - Where?!
the anchorage on Lycia. lt's the closest.
negative, sir. We cannot worm-hole travel in the middle of this.
do it.
coordinates for anchorage at Lycia locked in.
n0 confirmation signal, sir.
travel us now.
sir, without confirmationm - That's an order.
go. Gol
cabin pressure dropping.
heavy damage to outer hall.
there's a breach possible to middle cabin.
find me something I can land on. Now!
I got something.
bearing 340 by 95.
range, 86, 000.
warning: this planet has been declared unfit for human habitation.
placed under class-1 quarantine by the interplanetary authority.
under penalty of law, Do not attempt to land.
repeat: do not attempt to land.
lt's not possible.
the computer might have defaulted back to a known demarcation point.
no. Not yet.
travel us again. - Negative, sir.
this ship is gonna tear apan at any moment.
set her down.
Mayday, mayday. This is Hesper 2-9-9 heavy in distress.
we took heavy damage from an asteroid storm and are going down with bingo power.
you all right?
evaluate.
good to go.
you confirm the Ursa's contained.
the back of the ship is gone.
Rangers, count off.
Rangers, count off.
damn.
the cockpit is directly above us.
go.
left rear. There's a utility compartment.
lnside, there's an emergency beacon.
silver. Like a saucer. Bring it to me.
consolidate inventory up.
general Cypher Raige.
crash landed.
two confirmed survivors.
Kitai, the emergency beacon you brought me will fire a distress signal deep into space.
but it's damaged.
there's another one in the tail section of our ship.
this is us here.
that, is the tail.
somewhere in this area.
lt's approximately 100km from here.
we need that beacon.
you understand? - Yeah.
both my legs are broken. One very badly.
you are going to retrieve that beacon, or we are going to die.
do you understand? - Yeah.
repeat what I just said.
l have to go retrieve the beacon, or we going to die.
you have air-filtration inhalers.
you need to take one now.
the fluid will coat your lungs, increase your oxygen extraction allowing you to breath more comfortably in the environment
you have six vials.
ln your weight, that should be 20-24 hours each. That's more than enough.
your life-suit and backpack are equipped with digital and virtual imaging.
so l'll be able to see everything that you See...
and what you do not see.
l will guide you.
lt'll be like I'm right there with you.
take my cutlass.
lt's the C-40.
full, 22 configurations.
Kitai, every single decision you make will be life or death.
this is a class-1 quarantined planet.
everything in this planet has evolved to kill humans.
d0 you know where we are?
no, sir.
this is Earth.
and... the Ursa?
there are three possibilities.
first and most likeliest, it died in the crash.
the second and less likely, is that it is iniured very badly and Still contained.
the third and least likely, is that it is out.
we will proceed, however in anticipation of the worst case scenario.
every movement will be under protocol "escape and evade."
lf he's out there,
I will see him long before he gets anywhere near you.
do you understand?
Yes, sir.
do exactly as l tell you, and we will survive.
Kitai, calm down.
take a knee.
root yourself in this present moment, now.
sight, sound. Smell.
what do you feel?
my body feels heavier.
very good.
earth gravitational pull is different than at home.
very good.
now, let's go.
what happened?
you didn't see that? - Kitai, what happened?
I'm fine.
no change, I just slipped.
there's condensation on the stones.
I'm good to go.
general Cypher Raige.
initiating remote probe recon.
primary target:
Ursa.
I want to reiterate that your navi-band is our sole means of communication.
Roger.
temperatures in this planet fluctuate dangerously, Kitai.
and most of the planet freezes over completely at nighL
but there are hot spots.
geothermal nodes between here and the tail that will keep you warm during the freeze-over.
you must reach one of these hot spots each evening before nightfall.
ls that understood? - Copy.
standard operating procedure till l give you further instructions.
stand by.
dad, are you there?
Hey, dad, are you there?
dad?
are you there?
Hello?
l'm here.
a boy l know had this.
lt's a real book. For a museum.
lt's "Moby-Dick."
he said l can even hold on to it.
hold on, to what?
the book, dad.
do they really kill these whales?
we, Senshi, for their oils and they almost disappeared.
just before the age of carbon fuels.
Where's your brother?
kit.
Hi.
dad, are you there?
l'm here.
where are you?
my suit turned to black.
l like it, but l think it's something bad.
your suit is made of smart-fabric.
I'm tracking a life-form moving towards you from the west.
lt's closing rapidly.
50m.
lt is right there, Kitai.
do not... move.
recognize your power.
this will be your creation.
stand down, cadet - Kitai! - Go awayl
control yourself, cadet.
Kitai! Stand down!
get awayl - Get the hell away! - Kitai!
to your rear. Out to your rear.
okay, l'm going.
there's a river, 250m straight ahead, go.
they are no longer in pursuit.
cadet, you are not being followed.
l repeat, you are not being followed.
Kitai, you are running from nothingl
Kitai!
Kitai, put my damn cutlass away.
you are not being followed. Take a knee.
take a knee, cadet
you want to die today, that's fine, but you are not going to kill me.
Kitai, I need you to do a physical assessment
you are showing rapid blood contamination. Are you cut?
l'm dizzy.
Kitai, self-eval.
good, god!
dad, I can't stand.
open your med-kit.
you are going to have to administer the antitoxin in sequence.
inject yourself the clear Iiquid firsL
do it now.
l can't see.
the poison is affecting your nervous system. Stay even.
dad, please come help me. l can't see.
l can't do this without my sight, dad. Please, come and get me.
Kitai, iniect yourself directly into your heart with the first stage. Do it now.
now the second. ASAP.
to your left, Kitai.
left!
l can't feel my hand.
dad, I can't feel my hands.
press it into the ground.
roll over on it and press it into the ground, Kitai.
great work, cadet
but you are going to lie there for a moment.
the parasite that stung you...
has a paralyzing agent in its venom.
so you are going to have to lie there for a litlle bit.
while the antitoxin does its job.
it's time to wake up.
son, the temperature is dropping five degrees every ten minutes.
you have got to wake up.
can you blink your eyes?
son, l need you to, please, blink your eyes.
blink your eyes.
Hey, dad.
Hey.
that sucked. -That is correcL
you got 9. 7 km to the hot spoL
how about you show me that 10km in 50 minutes, cadet?
sir, yes, sir.
two mikes out. All good.
who wants to be a ranger? Who wants it?
watch him go. Watch him go.
five miniute out.
come on. Lights out.
happy 19th birthday, Senshi.
dad, you help me.
no, Senshi. You go ahead. You blow.
come on, dad. Blow.
Nah. You know there's no way I can actually do that from here.
no. I think you can.
Faia, you're right there. Help the girl.
you can do it.
I love you, dad.
hot spot one arrival:
H. plus 54 minutes.
equipment check and consolidate.
take your next inhaler.
your... oxygen extraction is bottoming.
take your next breathing fluid.
second dose 0f breathing ﬂuid complete.
count off remaining.
four vials remain, Sir.
repeat.
four vials remain, Sir.
dad.
dad.
l'm here.
how'd you do it?
how'd you first ghost?
out for a run.
alone.
something that l wasn't supposed to do.
Ursa de-camos,
right in front of me.
I go for my cutlassm lt Shoots its pincer.
hight to my shoulder.
next thing l know, we're 0ver the cliff.
falling.
30m. Straight down.
into the river.
we settle onto the bottom.
lt's on top of me.
but it's stopped moving.
and I realize...
he's trying to drown me.
l'm thinking, l'm gonna die.
l'm gonna die.
you cannot believe this is how you gonna die.
I could see my blood bubbling up,
mixing with the sunlight,
shining through the water.
and l'm thinking, "wow...
that's really pretty.
everything slows down.
I see his pincer through my shoulder.
and l decide:
l don't want that in there anymore.
so I pull it out.
and it lets me go.
and more than that I can tell...
lt can't find me.
it doesn't even know where to look.
and it dawned on me...
fear is not real.
the only place that fear can exist is in our thoughts of a future.
it is a product of our imagination.
causing us to fear things that do not at present and may not ever exist.
hat is near insanity, Kitai.
now, do not misunderstand me:
danger, is very real.
but fear is a choice.
we are all telling ourselves a story.
and that day, mine changed.
14 km to the falls.
that's our midway checkpoint.
l'm reading you.
Kitai, get to the falls. ASAP.
l hear something. I think it's water.
a lot of it.
lnventory up.
food rations, half available.
flares, full.
Med-kit, half-available.
breathing ﬂuid...
breathing fluid, four vials available.
why you're not showing me the case?
what?
show it to me now.
I thought that I could make it, sir.
Abon mission.
return to the ship.
that is an order.
don't come out.
no matter what.
that's an order.
help!
help!
no, dad.
we... I can do it. l can...
l don't need many. l can get across with just two.
you need a minimum of three inhalers to make it to the tail.
you have exhausted your resources.
l can get across. I can... l can do it with iust two, dad.
this mission has reached abort criteria.
I'll take full responsibility.
you did your best.
you have nothing more to prove.
now, return to the ship.
what was your mistake?
trusting me?!
depending on me? Thinking that l can do this?
now I'm giving you an order...
to turn around and return to this ship.
you wouldn't give any other ranger that order.
you are not a ranger, and l'm giving you that order.
what was l supposed to do?
what did you want me to do?
she gave me an order.
she said, "no matter what, don't come out of that box.
was l supposed to iust come out and die?
what do you think, cadet?
what do you think you should have done?
because, really, that is all that matters.
what do you think you should have done?
and where were you?!
she called out for you. She called your name.
and you weren't there, cause you never there.
and you think I'm a coward?!
you're wrong! I'm not a coward!
you're the coward!
I'm not a coward!
Kitai!
Kitai, you've got incoming.
do you copy? You've got incoming.
don't...
Kitai, dive!
dive!
Kitai!
No!
leave them alonel
get awayl
dad, I'm sorry, it's just...
where is my Son?
general Cypher Raige.
this is a message for my wife.
Faia, l have lost contact with our son.
end message.
you have six vials. ln your weight, that should be 20-24 hours each. That's more than enough.
l estimate four days to reach the tail.
we'll break it to sections.
you have six hours to reach the first geothermal site.
first leg is 20 km. to the mouth of the north foresL - I'm right here. - Five minutes out.
keep moving. - That's about one hour.
take your next inhaler.
H. plus 54 minutes.
there's an escarpment
looks like it could be a waterfall
we will call that our midway point.
l can get across. l can do it with just two, dad.
14 km to the forest. This is us here.
that, is the tail.
you are going to retrieve that beacon...
or we are going to die.
leave me alone!
wake up.
it's time for you to wake up.
Hey.
Hey.
l was iust about to come out that day.
no, you weren't.
but you did the right thing.
dad says l Should have tried.
he's just mad at himself, that's all.
why couldn't you ghost?
you're close right now.
I am?
are you scared?
no. I'm tired.
that's good.
you filled your heart with something else.
now you gotta get up.
I memorized some "Moby-Dick."
Kitai, get up.
all that most maddens and torments... - Kitai, wake up!
all that stirs up the lees of things. - Wake up!
lt's time to wake up. - All truth with malice in it.
Kitai! - AIl that cracks the sinews and cakes the brain.
wake up!
hey... thanks.
no.
dad!
dad, it's Kitai.
l made it to...
Kitai? - Dad, l made it to the tail, do you copy?
Kitai, I'm here.
are you okay? - Dad, do you read me?
l copy.
dad, I made it to the tail, do you copy?
Kitai, we have electrical interference.
you're in a black Zone.
l repeat, you are in a black...
dad, the Ursa is not contained. Please, copy.
dad? - I'm here.
l swearto you, l'm here.
take a knee.
lt is the ionic layer.
and the atmosphere above your current position, it is causing electrical interference.
that is why the beacon is not firing.
to your north.
the peak.
you must find the beacon from the peak of that mountain.
see it, Kitai.
please.
see it.
good boy.
good boy.
good boy.
it is a pheromone trigger.
he set it to scare you...
so he can track you. Keep moving.
lt has found you.
run.
just run, Kitai.
just run.
climb in there, okay? It won't be able to smell you.
dad!
root yourself in this present moment, now.
sight, sound. Smell.
what do you feel?
you're still in that box.
it's time to come out.
stand me up.
general.
l said... Stand me up.
watch his back.
dad!
Yeah.
I wanna work with mom.
Yep.
me too.
Attaboy! Keep him busy!

tonight's light heavyweight winner...
from the great state of New Jersey...
you're gonna be the next champ, Jimmy!
Hey, how you doing?
just give them a few. Leave them wanting.
you want to sign my name for me, too?
at least then they can read it.
you gave him a cold meat party.
sign this for me, Mr. Braddock.
you've been getting stronger with every fight.
l've been seeing it.
you may favor the right, sure, but you got no stage fright or nerves.
and you have never been knocked out.
you're in line. That's all l'm saying, Jimmy.
you're gonna get your shot.
all right, let me see what we got here.
$886 for Jeanette...
$772 for Lou and Whitey...
$1, 000 for the ring fees, my $2, 658 and your $3, 544...
makes $8, 860. Stick that in your mattress, lrishman.
when we get there, you gonna come in and see the kids?
lt's been a while. Come on. They miss their Uncle Joey.
Yeah, that's very sweet. You still married to the same girl?
l was this morning.
well, congratulations. Maybe l'll take a rain check.
and would you tell her...
will you tell her l undercharged on the gym fees...
and no load on the towel? Would you do that for me, please?
l will be sure to point it out. l appreciate it.
you stop up at the corner here somewhere, Frank.
home to Jersey for Mr. Adventure over here.
all right, see you, Frank.
l could kill you!
l like the sound of that.
Yeah, l like the sound of that a lot.
Jimmy. Yeah?
my sister.
daddy, did we win?
Yeah, we won.
how are you, Alice?
good. That's wonderful, Jimmy.
Hey, Howard.
thank you.
so tell me about him.
was he a real slugger?
you know, you could come and watch.
no. You get hit...
every time, it feels like l'm getting hit, too.
and l'm not half as tough as you are.
so, tell me about the girls.
girls?
l was at the Garden, it was a fight night
come on. There was one.
there must've been one. No.
blond? Brunette.
[exclaiming]
tall?
like a gazelle.
l don't know how it is she breathed up there.
Mr. Braddock!
you're so strong!
and your hands, they're so big.
you're so powerful!
Jimmy, l'm so proud of you.
l'm so proud of you.

good night, Mom.
good night, sweetheart.
l can't find my socks. [shushing]
Jim! l'm sorry.

don't you remember? No.
well, you were out like a light.
how do l keep them this warm?
mama, l want to eat, too.
mommy will get you some, honey.
Hey, Rosy-Rosy. Good morning, good morning.
got a notice yesterday. Gas and electric.
come on.
Okey-dokey, there we go. l'll get the milk.
well, l think there's some left over.
Yep.
you know, l got that fight tonight at the armory.
Yeah, one guy, Abe Feldman.
that's $50, win or lose.
that's good.
lf l beat him, maybe l can get my purses back up to $75.
that would be great.
rosy, use your fork, please.
who needs a cow, huh?
mama, l want some more.
l'm sorry, sweetheart. We need to save some for the boys.
here you go.
you know, Mae, l dreamed last night...
that l was having dinner at The Ritz.
with Mickey Rooney and George Raft.
really! Yeah.
and l dreamed l had a steak. A thick, juicy steak.
like this, Rosy.
and then l had a mountain of mashed potatoes...
and l went back for ice cream three times.
l'm stuffed.
l'm absolutely full. l cannot eat another thing.
want to give me a hand?
boys, hurry up. Don't dawdle.
let's try and sleep a little more.
l need nine men and only nine.
seven. Eight. Nine. That's it!
all right, let's get a move on!
go on, get going! Got a lot of work today!
Hey, Dad. Hey.
no shifts today, Dad? What're you doing, son?
l'm being good. l'm being quiet. l'm being 'hayve.
great.
daddy!
Hey, Rosy-cheeks. How you doing?
daddy, Jay stole!
what? Jay stole.
what's all this about? See? lt's a salami.
young lady, your brother's in enough trouble...
without you telling on him. You understand?
lt's from the butcher's.
and he won't say a word about it, will you, Jay?
will you, Jay?
okay, pick it up. Let's go.
do not test me, boy. Right now.
Howard, stay here.
okay, let's go! Come on, give me a hand here!
great, then you don't get paid!
Bye.
don't forget to pick it up easy!
Marty Johnson had to go away to Delaware to live with his uncle.
Why?
his parents didn't have enough money for them to eat.
Yeah, well, things ain't easy at the moment, Jay, you're right.
but there's a lot of people worse off than what we are.
and just 'cause things ain't easy...
that don't give you the excuse to take what's not yours, does it?
that's stealing, right? And we don't steal.
no matter what happens, we don't steal.
not ever. You got me?
are you giving me your word? Yes.
go on. l promise.
and l promise you...
we will never send you away.
lt's okay, kid.
you got a little scared. l understand.
lt's okay.
Jim, he's a very slow guy.
just plants himself there.
so you just keep him steady.
keep him trapped in the middle. Keep dancing around him, okay?
you know what to do. You know this type.
that guy's a bum.
two bits will get a guy a seat.
and that guy gets to watch you bleed and call you a bum.
and l know l gotta take it from him, 'cause he's a paying customer.
l see.
well, well, well.
pardon me, miss. Allow me to restate my position.
Mr. Abraham Feldman is a novice fighter...
whose ass you should gently kick...
until it is humped up between his shoulder blades.
that is, if it doesn't offend your overly sensitive nature.
God knows.
now, you see, that break's still a few weeks away.
l know. Yeah.
and you were gonna tell me about this when?
lt's gonna be fine. lt's not fine. No, it's not.
what the hell? You don't tell me?
what the hell kinda crap is that? l owe everybody money, Joe.
l can't get any shifts.
we ain't got any cash.
l got it.
screw them. l'll tape it double.
Thanks.
keep up. Stay up.
keep moving. Keep your legs moving.
and here comes Braddock with his long-time manager, Joe Gould.
you're washed up, Braddock.
and now for our main event.
Hey, which one's us, pal?
Jersey veteran James J. Braddock...
is up against Hymie Caplin's latest charge...
young Abe Feldman from Schenectady, New York.
six rounder.
some might recall that Braddock was once...
a light heavyweight title challenger.
his golden-boy peak ended when Tommy Loughran...
handled Jim over 15 rounds back in '29.
since then, the oft-injured Braddock...
has shown only a glimmer of his early promise.
and the losses have started to pile up.
but Braddock continues to battle.
and here comes the popular Abe Feldman.
Feldman looks to be the real thing...
and showed some real moxie in his recent win over Hans Birkie.
Hey, who whipped Latzo?
l did. Goddamn right.
who KO'ed Slattery in the ninth...
when everybody said he didn't have a rainmaker's chance in hell?
that'd have to be me, too. Right.
and we're supposed to pucker our assholes over this Abe Feldman?
the guy couldn't break wind. No.
Hey, Jimmy.
anyplace else you'd rather be?
no. Good.
now, what are you gonna do about it?
here we are halfway through the fifth [men screaming] and it's more of the same.
the boys clinch again.
break it up.
he's crushing my guy. Get him off!
[Crowd booing] Break!
the boo-birds have started flying here.
they want action from these fighters.
Feldman sticks a left in Braddock's face.
Braddock's right hand is his best and only weapon.
he'll show the left, but it lacks snap and Feldman knows it.
come on, give these yokels a shot in the ass!
Feldman ducks a haymaker but fails to follow up.
and another big right by Braddock.
now, there's the Braddock we all recall.
but it's one at a time. It may not be enough.
come on!
the referee pulls the boys apart.
and there's the bell to end the fifth.
easy now. Easy.
l saw that. You bust it again?
l'm calling it, Jim.
you gonna use the left? Okay, good.
you get in there but you don't let him crowd you.
you work his belly, you hammer his belly with the left.
last round. Come on, you got to show me something.
give me a good one. You're giving me an ulcer, Harry!
shut up.
work his belly with the left. You got it?
give him the flapdoodle with the right because he don't know.
right? 'Cause he's kind of stupid.
okay? Last round.
last round! Go get him!
the left!
damn it, l wish he could find his goddamn left.
that's it! Change it up!
southpaw, that's it!
Feldman prancing around, looking for an opening...
but still few clean punches by the fighters.
Braddock still pawing away with the left.
another ineffectual left from Feldman.
Braddock can hardly lift his arms. He's slow on his feet.
at least Gould in his corner is still throwing punches...
trying to urge his man on.
[Yelling] Go home!
go home, Braddock!
no holding, Braddock!
Cavanaugh's working harder than the fighters.
dry up!
another clinch.
it's as if 80 tough fights have finally jumped on Braddock's back.
you're a bum!
that's it!
Cavanaugh pulls them apart, and he's called the fight.
he's called the fight.
it's a " no contest. "
and the popcorn and the peanuts are raining down.
and I'm afraid to say that's all these fighters deserve...
for the show they put on tonight.
I'm telling you, it's sad to see a fighter that was once...
the caliber of James Braddock reduced to this.
lt's all right, Jimmy.
an embarrassment, that's what it was.
an embarrassment!
where the hell's the purse?
you wouldn't have to be asking that...
if you gave a shit about your fighter.
okay. He's fighting hurt.
maybe you got a bunch of fat and happy fighters at home...
can afford to rest a month between bouts. l don't know. Lucky you!
Christ, he hardly gets a punch in anymore!
fights being stopped by referees? He's pathetic!
fights like that keep people away.
we're revoking his license, Joe.
whatever Braddock was gonna do in boxing, l guess he's done it.
wait a minute. That's all.
[Whispering] Oh, boy.
Mr. Johnston!
what's going on?
you didn't tell him? Yeah, of course l told him.
he wanted to hear it from you.
come on, Mr. Johnston, no contest?
l broke my hand. Okay? lt's legit.
you don't see me crying about it.
l don't see what you got to complain about.
l still went out there, l still put on a show. l did what l could do.
you know, we did that boondock circuit for you...
me and Joe. Remember?
l didn't quit on you. And l didn't quit tonight.
l didn't always lose.
l won't always lose again.
l can still fight. Go home.
l can still fight. Go home to Mae and the kids, Jim.
go home? Go home with what?
go home with what? A broken hand from Mount Vernon?
Mr. Johnston!
baby?
what happened?
l didn't get the dough.
they didn't pay up.
they called it a " no contest, " said the fight was an embarrassment.
they decommissioned me.
Jimmy, what happened to your hand?
lt's broke again in three places.
they said l'm through, Mae.
they said l can't be a boxer no more.
mercy.
okay.
Jimmy, if you can't work...
we're not gonna be able to pay the electric, or the heat.
and we're out of credit at the grocery.
so l think we need to pack the kids.
they could stay at my sister's for a little while...
and l'll take in more sewing.
that way we could make two, three breadlines a day.
l'll get doubles, triples, whatever l can find.
Jimmy, you can't work. Mae, l can still work.
Jimmy, you can't work. Your hand's broken.
they see me lugging this around, you're right, they won't pick me.
not down the docks, not anywhere.
so we're gonna cover it up...
with the shoe polish.
okay?
l'm sorry. No.
no.
no.
l need five and only five!
come on, Jake!
five. That's it!
what the hell happened to your face?
l got in a fight. Yeah?
What'd you go do that for?
that's a good question.
l used to follow a pretty good fighter with that name.
and there's some other guy going around using that name now.
can't fight for shit.
gambling man will lose a lot of money on him. Twice.
that hand ain't gonna work.
you can't slow me down. l need this job.
l need the job, too.
what's wrong with the goddamn hand?
you see us falling behind, Jake?
he's all right.
appreciate it.
l'll get a cold beer.
just a water for me, Quincy.
all l got today are big spenders.
beer for him, too. l'm buying.
don't hurt my feelings.
lt's been a while, but... You don't have to twist my arm.
Yeah, l used to be a broker. Still lost it all in '29.
Yeah, me, too.
l had just about everything l ever earned in stocks.
even had a little taxi company.
l mean, who loses their dough on cabs in New York City, right?
well, l thought that one was gold for the grandkiddies.
you know, there's people living in shacks in Central Park.
call it the Hooverville.
this government's dropped us flat.
we need to organize, you know? Unionize. Fight back.
fight? Fight what?
bad luck? Greed? Drought?
no point punching things you can't see.
no, we'll work a way through this.
FDR, he's gonna handle it. Screw FDR.
FDR, Hoover, they're all the same.
you know, l come home one day. l stand in my living room.
and between the mortgage and the market and the goddamn lawyer...
that was supposed to be working for me...
it stopped being mine.
lt all stopped being mine.
FDR ain't given me my house back yet.
mama, why can't l go to school?
ls it because l'm a girl?
maybe. Hadn't thought of that.
who's that man at our house?
excuse me!
can l help you?
l'm sorry, lady, you're past due.
[Panting] No, you can't.
you can't. There's kids.
lf l don't, they let me go.
they already let two guys go. Please.
this apartment, it's what we got left that keeps us hanging on.
lady, l got kids, too.
$6. 7 4.
how much to turn it back on?
four months. $44. 1 2.
lf l work 26 hours out of every 24, it still won't add up.
we ain't got nothing. Nothing left to sell.
all the guys you could've married, huh?
Yeah. What happened to those guys?
lt's Howard.
since this afternoon.
'Bless us, O Lord...
'and these thy gifts which we are about to receive...
from thy bounty. "
l'm all prayed out.
here's more firewood.
where are you going? l said where are you going?
go to hell, you no-good bastard!
go on, then! We don't need you!
all right. Help me, pick up some of that wood.
l got it, Mama. All right, let's go, sweetheart.
all right, honey.
nice and warm, huh?
baby?
baby?
look at Mommy.
sweetheart.
mommy?
what's wrong?
nothing, sweetheart.
mommy will be right back, okay?
Howard's fever was getting worse and then Rosy started to sneeze.
where are they, Mae? Jim, we can't even keep 'em warm.
where are the kids?
the boys will sleep on the sofa at my father's in Brooklyn.
and Rosy'll stay at my sister's.
Jimmy, we can't keep 'em!
you don't make decisions about our children without me.
what if they get really sick? We already owe Dr. McDonald
lf you send them away, then all this has been for nothing!
lt's just until we get back-- What else was it for?
lf we can't stay together, that means we lost!
that means we've given up! l am not giving up!
l'm trying to protect our children. Mae, l promised him.
outside the butcher's.
l looked him in the eyes...
and l promised him with all of my heart...
l would never ever send him away.
you can't do this.
you weren't here.
you can't break my promise.
Jim, you didn't see. You weren't here.
l'm sorry.
l'm sorry, Jimmy.
what are you doing?
Jimmy! Where you going?
where you going, Jimmy?
that doesn't qualify you, sir. What else can you tell me?
the problem is my wife is losing all of her teeth.
l got a relief order for her.
the doctor says it's due to insufficient diet.
she's still nursing the baby on account of...
we can't afford milk for the family.
okay.
l never thought l'd see you here, Jim.
he jumped up...
kicked his stool out of the ring...
and he was just, he was furious.
l grabbed the mike...
the thing is, l can't afford to...
l can't afford to pay the heat.
l've had to farm out my kids.
you know, they keep cutting shifts down at the docks...
and you just don't get picked every day.
l sold everything l've got that anybody would buy.
l went on public assistance. l signed on at the relief office.
they gave me $19. l need another $18. 38...
so l can pay the bill and get the kids back.
you know me well enough to know if l had anywhere else to go...
l wouldn't be here.
lf you could help me through this time, l sure would be grateful.
sure, Jim. Sure.
good luck.
Hey, Jimmy.
here you go, Jim.
good luck, Jim.
l'm sorry, Joe, l didn't... l'm sorry.
what in the hell do you have to be sorry about?
Jesus Christ, Jimmy.
how short are you?
about $1 . 50.
okay.
we're home! Hooray, we're home!
we're glad to be home!
good.
okay. All right.
Howard, don't jump on the bed. Sorry, Mama.
read to me, Jay.
'on his way up and down the stairs... "
do you like being home? l like being home, too.
my little doll.
make a wish, kids.
blow!
Hey, Howard, come on. They're gonna cut the cake up.
you wanna line up, huh?
you looking forward to some chocolate cake?
l liked it better when we had our own.
l can understand that.
Hiya, Howard. Hi.
Hey, your dad ever tell you that l used to spar with him?
you hit the Father? As often as l possibly could.
he was kinda tricky, though. Hard to catch.
go and get some cake. Go on.
missed you at mass, Jimmy.
l can get an extra shift on a Sunday, you know?
don't you walk away from me! James.
Mike, you hear me?
excuse me.
every day, " fix the world. " How about fixing your family?
what kind of father are you?
too proud to cross the street because she can't have her own cake?
and now you're drunk at church, for Christ's sake.
that a joke, Sara? Making a joke? l'm just saying it's enough!
guys, where's the ref? Why don't you stay out of this?
lt's between man and wife. How do you even call yourself that?
What'd you say to me? Come on.
get your hands off me!
you've had a couple drinks. lt's Sunday.
no harm in that. Day of rest. All washed up. Can't get a fight.
what, you want to fight me?
Mike, you don't have to do this.
l ain't got no beef with you.
come on! Can't make it in the ring, huh?
come on, Braddock, l'll take your head off!
Jim, no! Mike, you okay, baby?
[Panting] Why don't you get off me?
go to hell! The both of you!
Jesus, Jim, he wasn't gonna hit me.
Mike, wait!
now, what it's all about is rotating your body behind your fist.
bang. That's right. Right in the kisser, yeah.
there you go.
good girl. You got a better jab than your dad.
boy, you are a brave man. Not really. Mae's at the store.
that's a good one, kiddo!
you want to go play with the other kids while l talk to Uncle Joe?
Joe Gould, still looking dapper, l see.
certainly. Gotta keep up appearances, right?
good to see you, Jimmy. Nice to see you, Joe.
nice day, huh?
Yeah.
you drove all the way out here to talk about the weather?
maybe l was in the neighborhood. Did you ever think of that?
little fresh air.
Joe, this is Jersey.
Yeah. Good point.
l got you a fight.
go to hell. Come on. You want it, don't you?
what, we gonna bring this up with the Boxing Commission, or not?
Yes, and they'll sanction it. This one fight, and one fight only.
lt's not a comeback, right? lt's just one fight.
Why? 'Cause of who you're fighting.
how much?
just once, ask me who it is you're fighting.
how much? $250.
you're on at the big show at the Garden, tomorrow night.
you fight Corn Griffin, Jimmy.
number two heavyweight contender in the world.
prelim before the championship bout.
you know, Joe, this ain't funny. No, it's not.
and it ain't no favor, either.
Griffin's opponent got cut, and he couldn't fight.
so they had to find somebody they could throw in at a day's notice.
nobody legit would...
nobody would take a fight with Griffin without training.
so l told them use the angle Griffin's gonna knock out a guy...
never been knocked out.
you're meat, Jimmy.
are you on the level, Joe?
come on. Always.
for $250, l would fight your wife.
now you're dreaming.
and your grandmother. At the same time.
teeth in or teeth out? Take them out.
then you're dead. You're down, you're gone.
no chance. $250?
250 bananas. Come here.
Where's my blue bag?
I don't care. No.
Pim, do you have him? - I got him.
he's leaving the house.
he's late today.
where are you? Are you right there? - No, I'm across the street.
get closer than that. - I'm not gonna lose him.
I'm not gonna lose him. - Pay attention, guys.
9: 01, down Granville Park. Again.
okay, switch to channel seven.
Sarah!
Hi.
control the flow of traffic.
come on! Come here, Rusty!
rusty. Rusty, come here.
come... Rusty!
come on, boy.
come on. We're gonna be late.
Hello, Jack.
Sarah, could you turn it down, please? - What?
the music, if that's what it is. Turn it down.
Why? - Has anyone let the dog out yet?
it's Sarah's turn! I did it last time! - It takes, what, two seconds?
rusty, no! Leave it alone!
come on!
Andy, stop it.
Andy! Mom, tell Andy to get that thing out of here. It's screwing up the TV.
idiot.
Andy, a little help here, okay?
moron. - Idiot moron.
moron idiot. - Nobody's an idiot.
except for her. - Nobody's a moron.
except for her. - Andy, stop it!
I'm trying to watch this.
those two home together all week?
there's no school till Monday. - Oh, boy. What's your day like?
finish the details on the Morgan house. They're pouring the footings today.
then I have to find a guitar teacher for Sarah, pay some bills...
...and schlepping the kids.
you should get yourself a hobby, keep yourself busy.
I already have a hobby. - Yeah?
and it's taking care of you.
I don't deserve you.
no, you don't.
we owe Arlin and Vee a dinner. Wanna do it this week?
well, they're home this week. I just wanna be with the kids.
mom! Tell Andy to get that thing out! - Really?
you should have Marci drop my blue suit off at the cleaners.
Marci's in Manila till the 26th.
here, sport, give me this for a second.
mom! Excuse me, does anybody care? - This is what's doing it.
put this in my office. I'll show you how we can fix it.
okay? And, yes, I do care.
goodbye. - Bye, Jack.
Bye, Dad. - Bye, Andy.
don't torture your sister.
Sarah, this dog needs to go out. Don't forget his new collar.
Sarah. - Bye, Jack.
getting a welcome break in the weather before getting hit by a couple of storms.
that'll make the drive more difficult.
looks like smooth sailing this morning heading into downtown Seattle.
we've been seeing slowdowns and heavy traffic just about everywhere else...
morning. - Morning, Richard.
morning, cindy. How are you? - Morning, Jack. Great, thanks.
how do I say this, Bobby?
no. - Come on, Janet. I don't see why not.
look, Bobby, here's how this works. You ask me out, which you did.
I say no, which I did.
you say, "okay," and ask somebody else. You don't keep asking me.
at what point does it become sexual harassment?
right about now, Bobby.
Mr. Stanfield. - Morning, boss.
kid's persistent. - I don't know why.
the usual reason, I suppose. - Have you seen Ravi yet?
no, I'm on my way now, though.
don't forget, merger meeting.
nice flowers. - Born-again Bobby.
maybe he's trying to save your soul. - He'd need bigger blossoms than that.
good morning, Betty. - Morning.
how we doing? - Pike Street system's running slow.
I'll tell carol when she gets in. We'll get after it.
merger goes through, we'll go in and replace the whole thing.
Yeah.
morning, sir. - Good morning, Rick.
Hey, Ravi. What have we got?
brute-force login. The interesting thing is...
...he's coming in through Hong Kong, Korea and Malaysia...
...but he's trying sequential account numbers. He's hacking all over.
move over for me.
let's try a rule change on him, see what he does.
put in an IPS signature that black-holes the pattern.
see if that slows him down. - That'd slow me down.
that'd be resistant to false positives too. - Yep.
Thanks.
loss is higher than one would expect, considering your level of security.
just write it off?
that depends on how you view the statistics.
they're not particularly high, given the fact that...
...we're pushing the business into some new and uncharted areas.
online banking is where the business is heading.
where we have our branches...
...We'll provide our customers with more ways to control their money.
as you can see by the chart, after the merger...
...Accuwest will have 1100 branches in 13 states...
...with over 100 billion in assets. So to answer you, Harry, yes...
...we do see a reasonable level of fraud loss as a cost of doing business.
how many branches do you have? - Twenty-seven.
as head of network security, Jack...
...you've never really had to think in terms of economies of scale.
but your philosophy of risk is... - wait a second, Gary.
make this clear for me, will you? What exactly is my philosophy of risk?
no need to take this personally. - I take it personally, goddamn it.
I've spent 20 years protecting this bank, its customers and shareholders...
...from unnecessary risk.
Jack, I don't think you're hearing what I'm saying.
I hear what you're saying. Fraud loss is inevitable...
...pass it on to the customers as the cost of doing business.
we don't wanna do that, do we?
we're all here to serve the customers. Let's try and get along.
we can have the best of both worlds. - Doesn't exist, Arlin.
look, I'm sorry. This went on a little longer than I anticipated.
there's stuff I really have to get to.
okay, let's get on with it. - Network attacks...
...network activity.
where is this guy? - He's in reception.
he said it's personal. Should I get him?
no, I'll walk over there.
Mr. Stanfield, Mr. Hughes.
Jack Stanfield, Mr. Hughes.
do I know you? - I know you.
do you have a card? - Oh, yeah.
DHD Financial. What can I do for you?
you can give me the $95, 000 you owe me.
I don't know what you're talking about. - No?
I'm collecting for GambleNet U. S.A. Does that ring a bell?
no, it doesn't. - You racked up 95 grand in online wagers.
and I got the paperwork to prove it.
you got the wrong Jack Stanfield. I don't gamble.
I don't have any debt. Check your facts. - You're a deadbeat. See you in court.
Laurie, call security. - Don't bother, sweetheart.
gambling's an addiction, Mr. Stanfield. Get some help.
well, I thought the idea was to match it to the curtains.
Yes, but if you do that... - Nice flowers.
Bobby?
that would be the wrong thing to do, don't you think?
what's up, partner? - Take a look at this.
who were you betting on?
I wasn't betting. I don't gamble.
I don't even know how. - Well, that's obvious.
you think somebody got my information off the bank's internal network or what?
are you doubting yourself in your old age?
no. More likely a dumpster diver...
...somebody sifting through your trash. - Maybe.
a debt collector showed up this morning about it.
don't worry. I'll clean it up.
it's just a pain in the ass.
bill cox? Guy from Atlanta.
supposed to have a drink. - I can do 5: 30.
I wanna get home early, pizza night.
good. I'll let him know. - Okay.
Hey, you. - Hi, hon.
Harry and I need to see a guy for a few minutes after work.
okay if I'm late? - What are you thinking?
I don't know, 45 minutes, tops.
we'll see you when we see you. Love you.
love you too. Bye.
I see him. My question is this:
do we really wanna work for those Accuwest morons?
I'll listen to what he has to say. - This guy could be our future.
okay, okay.
bill. - Good to see you, Harry.
bill cox, Jack Stanfield. - How are you?
I've been looking forward to meeting you. Please, sit.
thank you.
Sarah, the pizza's here. My wallet's by the door.
is somebody gonna get that?
here you go. - So listen...
...I don't know how much Harry's told you about what I do.
not a lot. Just that you're in banking.
I have a company that provides banking-support services...
...mainly in the South, but, really, I'm an old-fashioned entrepreneur.
if that's a scary movie, turn it off. Your brother won't sleep for a week.
I'm so sorry to make you... - Hello.
Sarah! - Mom.
call 911!
there's over 200 regional banks in the U. S. Alone...
...that have nothing like the sophistication of the system you developed for Landrock.
Sarah! Leave her alone!
with your system's software...
...Harry's expertise in law enforcement and the physical security...
...you're an unbeatable team.
Hey! Come here!
No!
what are you doing to me? Get away! - Shut up!
you'd be your own bosses.
I'd just supply the money.
don't hurt my children. - Shut up!
Oh, my God, what do you want?
I have to think about a couple of other options...
...but this sounds very attractive.
okay, good.
I hate to break this up.
I gotta get home. - Family man.
No! Daddy!
so how many kids do you have?
two. Boy, 8. Girl, 14.
sure you don't need a ride? - No, thanks, Harry. I'm fine.
going back tonight?
no, I've got some business here in town. - Well, great meeting you. Take care.
she has beautiful eyes, your daughter.
what?
Jesus, what...?
Oh, my God. What do you want?
I wanna get you home. It's pizza night.
drive.
drive.
Liam, we're on our way. Everything all right?
fine, the house is secure. And we're setting up now.
I wanna talk to my wife.
you hear that, Liam? He wants to talk to his wife.
they can't talk right now.
she's busy.
who are you?
what's this about?
what do you want from me?
this is your exit, Jack.
three defenders had the chance to put him on the ground.
they're here.
as good as he's been down the years. Tremendous effort to stay alive.
where are they? - Through here.
Jesus.
what is this? - Daddy.
why have you done this, for God's sake?
it's okay. They're children!
I said, "If they were trouble." Were they trouble?
they were noisy. - Yes, we made an executive decision.
but you're a criminal, willy, not an executive.
but I thought you said... - Shut up.
daddy. - I wanna know what you want...
...and I wanna know now.
Beth...
...l'm sorry about all of this. I am, but, well...
there we are.
I need you to talk to your husband. He listens to you.
I need you to make him understand that if he doesn't do exactly as I ask...
...I will kill you and your two children.
but if you can make him listen, Beth...
...if you can make him do what I want...
...you'll all walk away from this unpleasantness unscathed.
not because I'm a nice man...
...simply because there'll be no reason for me to hurt you.
make sense?
can I rely on your cooperation?
just tell him yes. - Yes.
Sarah?
fine.
and you, big fella?
maybe.
Andy. - No, it's all right. It's honest.
do you keep a gun in the house, Jack?
no.
daddy! - I'm okay.
it's okay. - Don't worry.
it's okay. - I'm all right. I'm okay.
pass me the gun.
it's empty.
you lied to me, Jack.
don't let it happen again.
you have an excellent alarm system.
what are alarms for, Andy?
to keep people out. - That's right.
and they also keep people in.
I'll need the password, Jack.
lark.
lark. It's the name of our boat.
all right.
untie them.
take it easy.
daddy.
I'll be fine.
Hi, this is Jack Stanfield, account number 51216.
I need to change our alarm code and give you a new password.
I know it's difficult for you, but try and get some sleep.
mom, what's going on?
what do they want? - I don't know, sweetheart.
do you want something to eat, Jack?
I'm not hungry. - No?
do you have any wine?
there's some in the bar.
Pim, go and get me a nice bottle of red.
I don't know shit about wine, man. How do I know if it's nice?
lt'll be dusty.
I didn't know he had a gun.
they hit him so hard.
he'll be fine.
it's just a little lump on the head.
let's think about something nice, okay? - Okay.
I know.
we're onboard the Lark.
and the sail's up.
and the sun is shining.
and it's warm.
and, Andy, you're at the wheel with your dad.
vel.
get Jack a blanket.
he's got a busy day tomorrow.
she's asleep. Get some yourself.
I'll wake you in an hour. - Okay.
let's take a look, show you what's going on.
Yeah, we do have a big storm, big section of the country.
it's gonna bring a variety of weather...
morning, Jack.
time to get ready for work.
you can look for some snow by tomorrow through the upper Great Lakes.
you have to do whatever they want. I don't care what it is.
it may not be that easy. We've seen their faces.
but he said if we just cooperate... - I know what they said, Beth.
did you ever notice how big squirrels' teeth are?
Where's Andy?
breakfast.
count to three. - One, two, three.
Andy!
Andy.
this man is not our friend. Stay away.
but I want a pancake. - Go see your mom.
want some cheerios? - No.
you're worried I'll give him peanut oil, Jack.
I know about his allergy.
don't imagine for one second...
...that I just blundered in here out of the rain.
don't touch him.
don't talk to him.
and don't feed him anything.
I'm fitting you with two separate systems.
audio transmitter.
we hear everything you do.
what do I do when I get to the office? - You do your work, Jack.
chase that American dream.
the video camera, with a wide-angle lens.
we see what you see.
I've cloned your cell phone.
any call that you make or receive, we can monitor.
what about my family? - Oh, they'll be safe...
...Here with us.
now, tuck your shirt in and go to work.
Bye, pal. - Bye, Dad.
you're a young man.
you don't need to be doing this.
the longer it goes on...
...the deeper in you are.
let's stop it right now, before it gets worse.
same to you, kid.
you're gonna love me.
those tickets I couldn't get? I got them. - I need five minutes.
the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 16 points to 10, 255...
...on a volume of 22 million shares.
the NASDAQ Composite is up 11 points...
...to 2, 061 on a volume of 1. 6 million shares.
can you hear me?
can you hear me?
if you can hear me, tell your boss I wanna speak to him.
tell him to quit dicking me around and tell me what he wants me to do.
can you hear me? - Jack? Are you okay?
Yes, I'm just talking to myself. What's up?
Arlin wants to see you.
Yeah.
so you're an architect.
Yes.
and you designed this house.
I did.
it's nice.
Thanks.
how old is it?
seven years.
how much does a house like this go for? - This is about robbing the bank, isn't it?
you're using Jack to help you rob the bank.
open a few doors and press a few buttons.
just look after the kids, Beth.
and, Vel, stick to your work.
I need you to try and get along.
arlin, I'm tired of him patronizing me. Gary is an idiot.
be that as it may, he's a fact of life...
...on top of which, you may be working for him in a couple of weeks.
okay. I'll take care of it.
Jack. Are you okay?
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.
and Beth and the kids?
they're fine, Arlin.
listen, Jack, Gary doesn't like you very much...
...and based on your performance yesterday, it's not hard to understand.
also, we had a debt collector here yesterday asking questions.
what was that all about? - Somebody compromised my identity...
...and ran up $95, 000 worth of online gambling debt.
Harry's taking care of it.
you know me, l...
I don't gamble. I don't have any debt.
talk to Gary now.
I want this merger to go smoothly. - I can't today, I'm...
today, Jack.
okay. I'll take care of it. Thanks.
are we on for dinner next week?
Yeah, let me check with Beth.
looks good. Get it out there.
Gary?
Oh, yeah, Jack. Need something?
Yeah, I just wanted to have a word.
lf...
if I seemed like I was a little abrupt...
...or difficult yesterday, I wanna apologize.
I want you to know I am committed to this process.
just having a bad day, that's all. - Seem a little stressed. Everything okay?
Yeah. I'm just fine, Gary. Thank you. - You sure?
Yeah. - We can make this merger work...
...for everyone's benefit.
I'm here to help. If you ever do have a problem, my door is always open.
thank you, Gary.
Janet? Come in here for a second, will you?
we'll do some letters.
Janet, if I've been difficult or distant...
...for the last couple of days, I hope you'll understand.
I wanna apologize. - That's okay.
we're a team, you and me.
and I want you to understand how much I appreciate what you do for me.
Thanks, Jack. - It means the world to me.
sometimes I think I just need to...
...relax.
okay.
take a minute. - Okay.
take five minutes out of the day...
...and just sit quietly and take a break.
you know, just... - Sure. Jack...?
he's lost it. Completely lost it.
letter to Scott Smith.
dear Scott, pursuant to your request...
...for further information regarding the security-interface issues...
...unfortunately, the information that you requested is not available.
sorry for the inconvenience.
until the merger...
shit. Strike that.
Harry's in L. A. For a convention. - Thanks for coming to tell me that.
I can refer you to my associate, Gary Mitchell...
...who may be able to provide you with the information.
regards to the family, usual close. - Jack?
Jack, I've been looking for you.
shit.
there's a Bill Redmond here to see you. - Shit!
who? - Redmond, from the Federal Banking Board?
what are you talking about, Federal...? - Jack Stanfield?
bill Redmond. Pleased to meet you.
Janet, close the door, please.
look... - oh, Jack, Jack, Jack.
Liam, take the boy downstairs and break his knee.
don't do that.
it's my fault, not his. It's my mistake.
don't take it out on the boy.
please.
please don't. - Liam?
let him go!
leave him be for now.
I'd like a tour of the bank now, Jack.
I'm sorry, I have a terrible memory.
what was your name? - Janet Stone.
Janet, can I borrow a pen? - Sure.
that one'll do. I just need to write them down once, and then they stick.
I didn't know about your meeting. Who set it up?
it was a last-minute thing, Janet. I forgot to tell you.
now, I'm gonna give Mr. Redmond a tour of the bank.
Thanks. - I'll find you if I need you.
good morning, Mr. Stanfield. - Good morning.
I have a guest, Mr. Redmond. - Hi.
Hi.
open sesame.
Mr. Stanfield.
you'd think with so much plastic, there wouldn't be any need for this real money.
how long do they keep the images from those cameras?
fifteen days.
thank you.
how do you expect to get in and out of here?
I don't.
this is the real vault, isn't it, Jack?
binary code.
virtual money.
tell me, how can it be stealing if you can't even touch it?
that's it, huh? This is your plan?
you think your schoolboy techie friend can hack into these servers?
this is what you kidnapped my family for?
I don't need to hack into anything.
we're already inside.
all we need to do is plug in.
you're gonna log on to a maintenance terminal...
...and run a prioritized search selecting the accounts of your 10, 000 richest customers.
and then with the program on this, you'll withdraw $ 10, 000 from each...
...and transfer the money to my offshore accounts.
a hundred million dollars. Wow, that's a lot of money.
that's a good plan. - Thanks, we like it.
at least it was last week.
look around. Do you see any maintenance terminals to plug into, huh?
the bank that took us over had them removed.
there's nothing accessible from this room anymore. Not from this building.
you're in the wrong town. You should be in wichita, Kansas, Bill.
you designed the software...
...you find me a way in.
I wouldn't know where to start.
well, then you have a big fucking problem.
looks like it's almost done. - Yeah.
Andy!
let him go.
come on... - okay, okay.
answer the goddamn phone.
hello. - It's Tom.
Hi, Tom. - Something wrong?
no, everything's okay. I just dropped a bottle of milk...
...and it's just made a big mess everywhere.
listen, I thought we'd stop by... - Thanks, but we're all down with the flu.
all right, well... - okay. I gotta get back.
Thanks, Tom. - Okay.
mom. - Come on.
are you all right? Okay, you're okay.
don't you ever touch my children again, do you hear me?
shut your goddamn mouth.
from now on, you do as you're told!
roll down the window! - What?
how much is he paying you? - Get back in!
five million dollars to get my family out. - Get in the car or I call Bill.
there are traps in the system. He's gonna get caught.
you're all gonna get caught, willy.
five million dollars, right now. - In the car, I mean it!
get back in the car.
what the hell happened, man? - Nothing.
exactly. So, what's the plan? How do we get the money?
you are really beginning to bore me.
I want you and your wife downstairs now.
how was your day, Beth?
am I supposed to believe you care?
Willy! Come down here!
Jack has broken our agreement and decided not to cooperate.
Willy!
what's he talking about?
it's just a game, honey. - No, it's not a game.
listen to your wife, Jack.
Hey. - Sit down, willy.
so, willy...
...what happened today? How did Jack manage to hand over the pen?
I'm not exactly sure.
I mean, everything seemed to be fine. - Willy, I told you to watch him.
everything was cool. And then all of a sudden...
listen, willy...
...how can I expect Jack to do as he's told if you don't?
Yeah, I don't know.
I made a mistake. Sorry. - We all make mistakes, willy.
just not as many as you. - Yeah, yeah, I said I was sorry.
all right.
okay, you're sorry.
watch them.
God Almighty.
get out.
Oh, my God.
what happened? - Clean this mess up.
shit! Liam, come here.
what? - He shot him.
go through the basement. Get the kids out of here.
shut up, Vel. - Don't tell me to shut up.
pretend to be watching television, falling asleep.
nine o'clock, I'll divert them. - Sit down now!
Beth, go to the bedroom.
Jack, over there.
okay, honey.
don't really go to sleep, okay? - Okay.
just pretend to be asleep.
okay. - Okay.
this is all gonna be over really soon.
what are you planning?
how are you gonna get me my money?
I don't know yet.
I'm working on it.
you've got 12 hours till the bank opens, Jack.
shit.
go. Get Daddy's flashlight.
okay, go.
what's going on, Vel? - It's fine. It's just some local interference.
go check on Jack.
it's back.
Yeah, he's just sitting there.
Pim!
Vel, you stay here and watch.
okay, go, honey, go.
wait, honey.
mom. - Let me go first, honey.
Pim, check the bedroom! Vel, get these lights on now!
fast as you can. Fast as you can. Andy, go.
they're gone!
Liam, we need him.
they're not here!
Hello!
Yes, this is Jack Stanfield.
you okay? - Yeah.
I'm sorry. My son opened a door, and...
Yeah, I know.
come on, honey, help me. Ready? One, two...
they're in the garage!
come here. Okay, go, go, honey.
get out of...!
mom!
open the goddamn door now!
stop!
mom!
Andy! - Get them in!
leave them alone. - Get up!
mom!
Beth. Beth.
Jack. Jack! - All right! Move!
okay... - Move!
...let's do this a different way.
you'll find a way in, Jack.
that's why we chose you.
Hey, you mind if I watch TV?
Where's my mom?
she's upstairs, asleep.
no, she's not.
Where's my dad? - He's in his office, working.
well, can I see him?
no.
I know, I'm sorry.
I made a rule.
I'll let you see him in a bit, okay?
okay. - Good.
why have I got no sound?
is it broken?
no. Give it to me.
Fred, why don't you give up.
so you're a genius.
thank you.
you want a cookie? - Have they got nuts?
Why? - I'm allergic.
I'm sorry, Andy. I didn't know. Let me check.
no.
no, no, no.
not a peanut in sight. You're fine.
I promise.
Jack! Jack!
Andy? Andy! - Come on.
come on, baby.
breathe for Mommy. Come on, angel.
Andy, breathe for Mommy.
he's going into shock. - Is he breathing?
is he breathing? - Barely. He's just barely breathing.
it's not here. - Come on, honey.
get his backpack. Come on.
stay with me, Andy. Stay with me.
it's not here. - Mom, it's not here!
stay here. Stay here, Andy.
Oh, God. Come on, honey. Do something, he's dying.
breathe for Mommy. - Andy.
give it to me, please.
I'll do whatever you want. Give it to me, please.
Cayahuari Yacu, the jungle lndians call this country, "the land where God did not finish Creation."
they believe only after man has disappeared will He return to finish His work.
for God's sake. . .
if we're gonna do this. . .
if we're gonna do this. . .
. . . Iet's do it in style.
we're going to miss Caruso if you don't put some fire under it.
Oh, you've wiped oil all over your face.
isn't that better?
Oh, Molly, please.
come on, for God's sake!
champagne for the horses! The best!
we're gonna make it.
sir, Madam. This is a gala performance.
we come from lquitos, one thousand two hundred miles down the Amazon.
I had to row because our motor broke down.
look at his hands.
for two days and two nights I've been rowing to see Caruso once in my life.
you have no tickets.
this man needs to go in there. He has no ticket but he has a right.
sir, Madam, you can't go in there.
I'm going to build an opera house in lquitos and Caruso'll open it.
it'll be the greatest opera of the jungle. Please, let us in.
you'll work with us. Let us in, please.
I'd like to be in there myself, believe me. . .
follow me!
make sure to be quiet and press yourselves right up against the wall.
he pointed to you.
he pointed to me. You see him. . . he means me.
Fitzcarraldo? How do you spell it?
what an interesting name!
my father was lrish. My real name is Fitzgerald.
Brian Sweeney Fitzgerald.
they had trouble saying it in Peru.
Fitzgerald? lquitos? You're not the man with the railway are you?
Yeah, that's me.
well. . . the Trans-Andean Railway, but. . .
. . . the project fell through.
but the idea was a bold one.
at the moment I'm trying my luck as as ice producer, to make money.
here, all people want. . .
. . . for their money are the big names from Europe.
Sarah Bernhardt, an actress who can't even sing.
but her wooden leg is the talk of the town.
the ice, ah, I mean. . .
I'm doing all this because I have one dream. . .
. . . the opera.
the Great Opera in the Jungle!
Fitzcarraldo will build it and Caruso will sing at the premiere.
it's only the dreamers who ever move mountains.
for five years now we've been the richest town in the whole world.
it's like gold fever.
may I show you the house?
when this opera was built there were only a few huts here.
the building was practically in the jungle.
prices are ten times higher here than in New York.
there are palaces being built with tiles from Delft and Florentine marble.
and lquitos is catching up. It's still a filthy frontier town. . .
. . . but the rubber business is growing by leaps and bounds.
the better-off citizens in Manaus, if I may put it like that. . .
. . . send their laundry to Lisbon. . .
. . . because the water in the Amazon is felt to be impure.
aren't you going to stay?
I don't know.
I don't mind you're running a brothel.
but there are too many of your clients around.
come on. I train the girls for the best households.
much better than sending them out on the streets.
I've nothing against the girls, Molly.
I just can't stand the sight of dandies who think money can buy everything.
and the opera. . . I've got to work on this ice production.
you could take a crack at respectability, you know. Wouldn't kill you.
respectability just made me bankrupt.
I'm better off down there by the river.
got my real audience down there now. . .
the kids?
Yeah, that's my public. And a pig.
one of those lean racing pigs loves me.
how could she help it.
when I build my opera house. . .
. . . I'll see to it you have your own box and a red velvet armchair.
it works through a chemical reaction of two different salts.
just imagine the possibilities ice has, but people don't see it.
the children love it.
Yeah, they eat it.
imagine, one day. . .
. . . ice in every warehouse, on every ship.
Yes, make your bet.
what do you think of it?
I'll tell you what I think. You can read up about ice in any school book.
it's out of the question to apply for a patent.
but I have the experience, and it's experience that counts.
what good is ice here? To cool the rubber?
maybe we should magically create some glaciers in the jungle.
and then we'll build the Trans-Andean Railroad on sled skids. . .
. . . ioosen the brakes, give her a push. . .
. . . and adios! Off she goes, sledding down into the valley?
come on, come on.
don't take it to heart.
here, this is for you.
use this, play a hand with us.
the precious feeling of losing money!
nothing like it! Ecstasy!
the church remains closed 'til this town has its opera house.
I want the opera house!
I want my opera house!
I want to have an opera!
this church remains closed 'til this town has an opera!
I will build my opera!
I want to have my opera.
I could have let you cool your heels in there for two weeks.
Thanks. Two days were more than enough.
I'm sure Molly is behind this.
you're mistaken. But come with me.
I'll show you the real reason I'm letting you out so soon.
they won't budge. I felt moved. Even a horse would be touched.
that shouldn't be too hard to arrange.
all of them together, at the same time?
don Aquilino, The Borja brothers. . .
I have my ways. Don't worry. I'll bring all my girls with me.
we'll have all the rubber barons gathered together like flies.
and I guarantee you, they'll be feeling good.
I'll bring my phonograph.
you need some sprucing up first.
I'm not letting you out of my house like that.
a steam bath for Mr. Fitzcarraldo! Full treatment.
and then deliver him to my bedroom.
this is serious. . . help. . . hey Molly, tell them. . . help!
everyone wants money from me. The hospital, the fire brigade. . .
. . . and now you keep talking my ear off about your opera.
it gives expression to our deepest feelings.
what is he talking about?
our deepest feelings!
just take a look at this.
come a bit closer.
take a good look.
a little demonstration.
1 000 dollar bills seem to taste best.
see how fast our money goes down the drain?
you must have experienced this.
a railway is sure to swallow up a lot of money.
how thrilling it must be to go bankrupt.
let's return to our friends.
Yes, such a chance to meet all one's friends and rivals in one place. . .
. . . does not present itself very often.
rosita, over there!
take the champagne over there!
please, may we have your attention?
please, come a bit closer.
servant! Hold him!
he can't get away with this.
one moment! Please, please, please!
ladies and gentlemen, don't worry.
this man is harmless, he's just had a soul-stirring experience.
my servants will escort you to the kitchen.
my dogs' cook will prepare you a meal.
thank you very much, sir, you were superb.
to your dogs' cook.
to Verdi.
to Rossini.
to Caruso.
to Fitzcarraldo, the Conquistador of the Useless!
Cheers!
as true as I am standing here, one day I shall bring grand opera to lquitos.
I will outnumber you.
I will outbillion you.
I am the spectacle in the forest.
I am the inventor of rubber.
I will outrubber you.
sir, the reality of your world is nothing more. . .
. . . than a rotten caricature of great opera.
Fitz, Fitz, let's go.
he's as dead as a doornail. He is no opponent for you.
madam, I'm still standing firm on both my legs.
you're a big game hunter, aren't you?
what's that got to do with it?
then you should know: When you shoot an elephant. . .
. . . he sometimes stays on his legs for ten days before he topples over.
come on, girls, we're leaving. This way!
rubber. That's the way to do it. Forget about the ice.
you need a big steam-boat. And most of all you need land.
and hundreds of workers.
the rubber barons have divided up the land. But there's still some left.
how do you know?
through Don Aquilino. Why don't you pay him a visit?
forget about it.
why don't you try him out?
my territory begins right here where the Pongo ends. . .
. . . and reaches downstream for 80 miles.
and above the Pongo?
I'd like to have that myself.
we've thought about building a road across the mountains. . .
. . . but it would be an impossible venture, and there still wouldn't be. . .
a ship. . . and nobody has made it upstream?
want to see for yourself? We can go a little further by foot.
what's he saying?
we must be quiet.
he says, whoever talks. . .
. . . will be swallowed up by the evil spirits of the rapids.
the lndians call the rapids Chirimagua, "the angry spirits."
anyone who falls in there is lost.
the native bare-asses also say, "The water has no hair to hold on to."
is this a rubber tree?
right. Hevea brasiliensis.
they call the rubber tree caoutchou. . .
. . ."the tree that weeps."
these bare-asses love flowery language.
gold, they call "sweat of the sun.
bees, "father of honey.
you know, it's no easy job to civilize them, believe me.
how much do you think this stinky stuff weighs?
1 32 pounds! And I presume you're familiar with the market price.
how long does it take to make one of them?
three men one week.
presently I have a staff of 8, 500.
but I am thinking of increasing to 1 0, 000.
you're a strange bird, but I must say I like you.
that's my area. From the Pongo to the mouth of the Ucayali.
up there you see the Peruvian Amazon Company, a joint stock company. . .
. . . and there, the Borja brothers.
what does that square mean?
that's the rubber region of the Ucayali, about 1 4 million trees.
it's the only area still unclaimed.
because of the rapids of the Pongo das Mortes. . .
. . . you'd have to have wings to fly into this area.
what about up on the Pachitea?
no rubber trees, maybe a few, but not enough to make it worthwhile.
the only thing you'll find there are savage lndians.
no gold, no rubber, no nothing.
only head hunters. . .
the two rivers almost touch each other.
what?
how exact is this map? ls there anything more precise?
Oh, it's a pretty good map.
in 1 896 a group of surveyors and soldiers got to the Upper Pachitea. . .
. . . but most of them were murdered.
then some missionaries got as far as Saramiriza, their farthest settlement.
from there on you'll find only savage Jivaros and Campas.
two padres ended up as shrunken heads.
have you ever seen a shrunken head?
Yes. . . I mean. . .
no. . . sort of. . .
have you made your choice?
I can't decide -- I guess I'll take both.
Molly, listen! - What is it?
I need your money, every red cent you can spare.
Oh Fitz, not again. . . - I have an idea.
an amazing idea!
here, look at this.
I've bought some maps, I can explain everything to you.
first I have to contact a lawyer, then get a ship.
but my money is not gonna buy you a ship, Fitz.
you're squeezing me to death!
I can't breathe.
the document, please. Thank you.
the act of territorial acquisition is done step by step.
you and your partner sign, you pay the money. . .
. . . and I will complete the document with my signature.
before you sign, I'd like to direct your attention to the option clause.
what option clause?
through its executive organs, the Peruvian government is insistent. . .
. . . with no exceptions, that a region of this size be taken into possession. . .
. . . by deed and by proof within nine months.
you will have to prove that real operational steps. . .
. . . have been taken to exploit the region.
otherwise your right of exploitation will be terminated.
the point is that the state is concerned that areas such as this. . .
. . . are productively used by competent men of business. . .
. . . so that they
come on, we are wasting time.
may I ask you a question of a personal nature?
do you really know what you're doing?
we're gonna do what nobody's ever done.
we're going to be very, very rich.
well?
please, sir, sign on the dotted line.
that's it.
that's it.
isn't it marvelous?
we should be able to fix it up.
it's wonderful.
you haven't seen the whole thing.
I like it already.
watch out here.
everything's rotted.
the engine room.
up the stairs.
wait a moment.
wait. Let me go first.
to our contract! Please come in, gentlemen.
now that the purchase of my ship is settled, let me be quite frank.
you bet.
I forced you to take Cholo as mechanic or you wouldn't have gotten the ship.
I realize that.
very good. Good.
he's a first-rate mechanic, I'll tell you that much.
now, what else is he?
the reason behind it all, excuse my bluntness. . .
. . . is that I wish to be kept informed about the activities of my competitors.
I don't want my territory contested.
don't worry.
every steamship owner is a potential enemy. . .
. . . but those with just a canoe can't hurt us.
the two of us have a bet going. . .
. . . how long it will take until you go bankrupt.
Oh, don't take it personally, please.
we're all sportsmen, aren't we?
no, only one of us.
I shall move a mountain.
when is she gonna be ready?
tomorrow. For days he's been telling me tomorrow.
I hope she'll be ready for launching.
I wonder what this character's really up to.
what's your name?
paul Resenbrink. I'm Dutch.
they call me Orinoco Paul. . .
. . . because I know every goddamn bend in this river.
you haven't sailed for some time.
that's right. My last ship was the Adolfo.
my eyesight isn't so good, but I cannot be fooled.
what do you mean?
the jungle plays tricks on your senses.
it's full of lies, demons, illusions.
I have learned to tell the difference between reality and hallucinations.
I see that you took part in the Pachitea expedition in 1 886.
Yes, as helmsman.
on the return trip I was the captain.
the captain died. There were only five survivors.
paul Resenbrink, you have captain's authority.
help me choose the crew.
we need strong, fearless men.
I'm afraid we'll find few good men here.
first of all we need a pilot.
does anyone have experience as a pilot?
scram, you puny runt! I'm Huerequeque.
brethren! I am Huerequeque!
I am the best cook in all of el Amazonas.
I have been on every ship.
and amigo, I'm not stupid. I know what your plans are.
huerequeque may tip the bottle now and then. . .
. . . but up here. . . electric, electrico!
also, I am the best gunman on the entire Amazon.
what do you think of him? - Upstream and downstream.
is he really a good gunman? - I would have to say, yes.
what was your name? Huere. . .
Huerequeque.
Huerequeque, you are our cook.
Cheers, then.
please understand.
who bought the ship? Who paid for the crew?
it's my right to come with you.
Molly, you can't leave the girls. What are they gonna do without you?
and what will I do without you?
I'll be back.
Fitz. . . do you still love me?
we are partners, you and me.
Oh Fitz, you're crazy!
Oh Fitz, it's wonderful!
this is your day, Molly!
you've given the ship my name!
that's more than my poor heart can stand.
now comes the official part.
here. Throw it -- hard!
these are my assistants. I can't cook without them.
come on, kids, come on.
why isn't he going down to the Ucayali?
why is he heading upstream?
I thought he was going to the Pongo das Mortes.
you saw right.
Brian Sweeney Fitzgerald is going up the Amazon.
we're going upstream! What's the idea?
we're going up the river. That's the idea.
and, from now on, you only leave the engine room if I say so.
what do you think you're doing? Getting around my girls!
get lost!
don Fitzcarraldo! Don Fitzcarraldo!
you're back at last. I'd almost given up hope.
look here, Amazon Terminal ready for action.
I see you've become a father.
I knew you'd come back.
I thought you'd forgotten about me when the railroad construction ceased.
every year I repaint the first class booking office.
it looks a little weather-beaten. . .
. . . but wait until your trains cross the mountains from the Amazon. . .
. . . to the Pacific, then everything will change.
I've been here six years now, without payment.
therefore. . .
the engine is in good working order.
all the levers work, but. . .
but I must confess. . .
. . . I was forced to sell a few iron parts to the lndians.
they need it for their machetes and things.
they used to come at night to steal parts.
so I thought. . .
. . . it was better to sell than to have things stolen at night.
I had to do it. I was left alone and deserted on this post.
I thought you'd been sent home like everybody else.
let me show you outside.
the tracks reach 200 meters deep into the jungle.
come with me. I made an invention to scare off the lndians.
they've become more cautious. I do the same thing with the snakes.
I connect an electric line to the tracks.
the lndians get their fingers singed. They won't touch them again.
I chase the snakes onto the rails with a stick.
on the first rail they get fried, on the second they turn to ash.
every year, I cut back the bushes. . .
when will you resume construction?
the thing is. . . we've come here on a different project.
our whole financial situation will change overnight, if it works.
what I'm trying to say is. . .
. . . we need the tracks for another purpose.
no, not those from under the engine, not those. . .
don Fitzcarraldo.
the men are removing the tracks under the locomotive.
I'm begging you, leave me just a few yards to roll it back and forth.
Hey, leave those under there! There's more out in the forest.
thank you, thank you.
we should have reached the Pachitea a long time ago.
no, we haven't.
but according to the map. . .
I don't rely on maps.
how can you be so sure about that?
no river tastes like the Pachitea. It's just ahead of us.
isn't that something. . .
brimming over!
Oh, these women!
that's what I need.
what's going on here?
we're going up the Pachitea.
is that so?
where are we going?
amigos, welcome to the Pachitea!
known for it's native hospitality. . .
something is going on down below.
they don't seem to agree with our course.
what?
I told you in lquitos I needed men, not cowards who shit in their pants.
so. . .
whoever wants to leave, step forward.
welcome to Saramiriza!
Brian Sweeney Fitzgerald.
we thought you were a government commission.
welcome to our place, here.
welcome.
happy to have you.
I am Huerequeque. - Welcome.
thank you, thanks.
how can anyone learn patriotism from a school book?
the Government requires it.
the natives get used to it like vaccination.
the children already feel like Peruvians.
the other day I asked them. . .
. . ."Are you lndians?"
no," they said, "not us, the ones up the river are."
then I asked, "What are lndians?"
they said, "Indians are people." . .
. . . who can't read and who don't know how to wash their clothes.
and what do the older people say?
well.
we can't seem to cure them of the idea. . .
. . . that our everyday life is only an illusion. . .
. . . behind which lies the reality of dreams.
I am very interested in these ideas.
I specialize in opera myself.
what do you know about the Jivaros on the upper Pachitea?
I was there during the disaster in '96.
have you had any contact since then?
some years ago, two of our brothers set off with some natives.
one of them came back a few days later. . .
. . . and said the Jivaros had withdrawn deep into the forest.
the expedition vanished without a trace.
a few weeks later, one of our brothers was washed up.
they'd filled his stomach with heavy stones and his head was gone.
anyway, what do you want up there?
I'm planning something geographical.
Paul.
the crew.
quiet down, you drunken idiots! Stop it!
you have to crack down on the men, or you can find yourself a new captain.
who's causing trouble?
Evaristo Chavez and Fabiano, the Brazilian. And the two women.
they must go ashore immediately, they're the main ones.
and Huerequeque, he's smart but not to be trusted.
your services are no longer required. I give you two minutes to get ashore.
you'll see, we're the lucky ones.
and the women.
come on, move!
see to the rest!
and all of you, back to work. Go on!
reduce speed! Half speed ahead!
what are the men doing?
they've armed themselves.
under no circumstances are they to shoot.
that was our mistake on the first expedition.
go down and tell them that, or there'll be a disaster.
what the hell are you doing?
just trying to have a little conversation with our invisible friends.
idiot, this will cost us our lives. Yours first.
there are silences and silences.
and this one, I don't like at all.
there's something on the water.
where?
something black, floating towards us.
what's an umbrella doing here?
it must have belonged to one of the missionaries that the Jivaros killed.
strange.
seems to be a last warning. The bare-asses love flowery gestures.
I wish they would show themselves.
now it's Caruso's turn.
do you see the lndians in the canoe?
could that be a trap?
it doesn't look like one. No, I don't think so.
they would attack at night. And in bigger groups.
shall we stop and try to make contact?
no, don't stop. They wouldn't talk to us anyway.
something's moving over there.
those bare-asses have never seen the likes of this. Teach 'em some respect.
everything depends on how we behave.
tell me everything you know about them.
these Jivaro probably left the interior of Brazil about 300 years ago.
for ten generations they've been criss-crossing the jungle. . .
. . . in search of a white God in a divine vessel.
at the end of their pilgrimage he would show them. . .
. . . a land without sorrow and death.
we're gonna take advantage of this myth.
what the hell has that got to do with us?
if a bare-ass comes too close, I'll put a bullet right between his eyes.
but this God doesn't come with canons.
he comes with the voice of Caruso.
your loyal crew has deserted you.
that finishes this journey.
why didn't you go with them?
because I want this whole damned ship to turn back.
don't mess with me. I'll do what I like around here.
just keep the engine running.
those bastards!
suddenly they were all there with their rifles.
I told you all along they were no good. They'll never make it out of here.
start tomorrow. Clerk to the board of directors.
tamales! Tamales!
magic inks.
very light blow.
invisible ink for your secret letter.
sir?
I-I...
I would like... -You don't have to say anything.
does she know you love her?
Yes.
Yes, and of course, she loves you.
Yes.
do her parents know?
no, they don't.
what do you call her?
my flower.
my flower.
all right, this is what you could say.
my beautiful and beloved flower.
nobody can cut the stem of our love.
my life, my soul, be strong.
don't give up.
I baptize you in the name of the Father...
don't give up.
I can't read or write.
don't worry, I can. -I got this.
would you read it to me and maybe write an answer?
Yeah.
my beautiful and beloved flower.
no one can cut the stem of our love.
my soul, my life, be strong.
don't give up because our love is deeper than the deepest ocean. Emilio.
that's...that's a wonderful letter.
that's a wonderful letter.
I know just what your answer should be.
this must stop.
this must stop. -What must stop?
our coffee comes in strong brown sacks.
load well, but never tire your backs.
unload in Miami, these coffee beans and keep them dry...
...By any means." - What do you call this?
a-a bill of lading. -A bill of lading?
Yes. -In rhyme?
Yes.
and this..."To James Robinson and Company, Lombard Street,
I write with all the ardor I can muster to thank you for your exquisite letter of 16th Aug.
my heart beat faster as I read each word.
Oh, sirs, with all tenderness at my disposal,
I kiss and embrace you and sign myself, dare I say...
...Adoringly.
this is not a business letter.
this is a love letter.
love is the only thing that interests me.
well, the trouble is without the river navigation, there is no love.
it must stop.
if you can't write a straightforward business letter, you will be put to picking up trash on the dock.
but I need love.
don Leo, I need love.
I need love.
dona Blanca.
good afternoon. -Dona Blanca, so nice to see you.
you look wonderful, Dona Blanca. -You know my daughter-in-law?
Yes, of course, Dona Blanca.
Oh, my daughter was at school with her.
Yes, we paint at the park.
we met in Paris.
I thought her charming.
she has, alas, a scandal in her family.
mother, please. -Apparently, there is no law, human or divine, her father has not ignored.
and now he's run away.
it's only to be expected from mules.
she does not eat eggplant...
and does not play the piano.
but she is learning the harp.
Oh, do play for us. -Yes.
Oh, do, please, yes. -I think not.
serve the tea.
well, what news from the great world?
don Leo XII of the River Company says he's going to retire!
Oh, he's been saying that for years.
and if he does, who will succeed him?
Oh, he has a nephew. -An illegitimate nephew.
florentino Ariza.
do we know him?
I've seen him many times, but I can't remember what he looks like.
Yes, such an odd person.
impossible to describe.
he's...
he's not a person.
he's a shadow.
Oh. You know him?
I have my period.
how odd.
just yesterday, I told my anatomy class that married women have their periods as often as three times a week.
when can we move into our own house?
not yet. -When?
not until your mother dies.
I married a weakling.
would you have been better off with Florentino Ariza?
you don't see him...
but I do.
how joyless I am now.
would I have been happier with him?
poor man.
Ah, I am Dr. Juvenal Urbino.
I would like to see Don Leo.
he is having his siesta. Please, wait.
should be awake in five minutes.
and you are?
his nephew and chief clerk, Florentino Ariza.
still asleep.
please.
would you like a coffee?
do you like music?
I like the music of Carlos Gardel.
I see. Popular music.
Yes, but...
we must keep performing the best music in our city.
we must import the greatest artists from Europe.
I am working on it.
and of course the Poetic Festival.
that was my idea. I... I started it some years ago.
Yes, I know, I know.
Ah, well, I hope you will attend.
I mean to. I may even enter a poem.
Really? How amusing.
of course, one needs to...
raise money for these things.
that is why I am here to see your uncle.
my wife supports me in this.
I will say more.
my wife is the very soul of my endeavors.
without her I... I would be nothing.
I adore my wife.
thank God he's awake now.
ladies and gentlemen, damas y caballeros,
I welcome you to the Poetic Festival.
as in years past, this year's Golden Orchid will be presented by none other than...
my wife.
just in time.
and the winner of this year's Golden Orchid is...
What?!
it's a scandal!
what was the name?
it sounded Chinese. It's impossible.
read his poem. -Yes.
your body is a holy garden..." -Believe me, my heart goes out to you.
I know you must have entered a poem because of how the flower trembled in your lapel.
that's why I took mine off.
your body is a holy garden...
would you like me to see you home?
I'm sorry to have been so silent, but...
I'm still very angry.
I understand.
but we should at least tell each other our names.
I am Florentino Ariza.
Sara Noriega.
thank you. Good health.
would you like to see my albums?
your what? -Albums...
photographs of public events.
I'm a teacher of civics, you see.
Really? Of course I would like to...
to see them.
what is it?
may I sit beside you...
and cry? -Of course.
of course.
I'm so...
disappointed.
I can't stop.
maybe you should loosen your bodice.
it will help you to feel more...
may I help?
tomorrow we do it in bed.
you are quite wonderful.
tell me, how would you define love?
love?
love is...
love is everything we do naked.
spiritual love from the waist up, physical love from the waist down.
Mm-hmm, yes, divided love.
that could be a poem...
divided Love.
Yes, it could be.
let's write it together, a poem on divided love.
we can enter it in next year's Poetic Festival.
we'd be certain to win.
tell me, tell me! -Yeah.
that's a good idea.
divided love!
divided love!
divided love!
calm down! Calm down!
stop it, calm down, horse!
miss? -Calm down.
miss?
please, allow me to give you a lift.
please.
thank you.
by the way, I am Florentino Ariza.
olimpia Zuleta.
am I taking you out of your way?
not at all. Not at all.
I would have been in terrible trouble if I had lost my parasol.
why so? -My husband gave it to me.
married long?
just over a year.
just a bride.
he's a very jealous man, my husband.
what does he do?
he sells trinkets in the market.
Oh. -And pigeons.
excuse me, sir? We're here.
Yes, senora. Ho, ho!
how do I thank you?
you could sell me a pigeon.
they're not for sale.
then what must I do to get one?
well, you find her in a storm.
you drive her back to the coop.
this is how I say thank you.
go away! Leave me alone!
go away! Go away!
I don't know who are you!
I don't know! -Help me!
who am I? Who am I?
and whose son are you?
I'm yours. -Whose son are you?
wake up. Look after her! -Ay! I fell asleep.
where am I now?
uh, Rosy...Rosy Martinez.
Oh. -Who is this Rosy Martinez?
from a children's story long ago...
give her the breakfast.
at last you are here.
Oh! Where have you been?
you're never coming to see me.
Oh, you little boy! Such a wonderful boy!
and his name is...
his name...
go on! Go! Go!
go back to your whores!
you took advantage!
the only disease you ever had was cholera.
no, Mama. You confused cholera with love.
didn't you like the nice gentleman?
huh?
I must see you again.
and for only one reason.
not such a nice gentleman.
senor Ariza? -Yes.
the pigeon lady sends you this and says please keep the cage locked.
um, if it flies again, she will not send it back.
in many ways it was sinful.
and I am a saint.
because you see, Ricardo, I persisted.
I broke down her defenses and stormed the citadel.
olimpia Zuleta never refused the meetings I arranged.
but then, I got tangled in my own net.
I thought it would be the same as it was with the others.
just another escape route from Fermina.
but then, I found myself falling for her.
and I became a lover in pursuit.
I hunted her.
I was the lover who never showed his face.
I will never be able to smell turpentine again...
without thinking of this blessed afternoon.
no, wait, wait.
what?
what are you doing?
you will see.
this is mine
No!
No! No!
he told the police why he did it.
doesn't mention you.
there's no more life, there's not There's no more life, there's not There's no more rain, there's not There's no more breeze, there's not...
the sky is crying for Olimpia.
and so am I.
there's no more crying, there's not There's no more fear, there's not...
what have I done? What have I done?
take me there To where you are Take me there Take me there To where you are Take me there.
what's the...
what's she going to the market for at this time of the night?
so whose son am I, Mama?
eh, whose son am I?
I hoped your mother would have liked my singing.
I know she would. I know.
the only regret I have in dying is that I can't sing at my own funeral.
good people!
good people.
fellow citizens, we are gathered here at the dawn of a new century.
the 20th century will see the end of man's suffering.
the 20th century will bring us harmony, peace, and it will bring us light!
474...
Peruvian spinster, Luisa...
Sunday school teacher.
my destiny in life is to love Fermina.
senor?
senor.
over there please.
come on, come on!
try it.
tell me what you think.
delicious. Absolutely delicious.
what is it?
eggplant.
more, please.
perhaps, as an act of remembrance, we should name our next child
I love you above all else.
more than anyone else in the world.
the important thing in marriage is not happiness but stability.
and love.
nothing is more difficult than love.
senora, buy my parakeets. Look, they're very pretty.
senor Ariza, we wanted to thank you.
sorry?
you wrote letters for us.
Ah, yes. I remember, yes.
it was the only time I wrote letters for...
for both lovers. It was like writing to myself.
we're married now.
good.
we wanted to ask you, will you be godfather?
Yes, of course.
he's our first son.
Yes, I will be honored.
I'll be damned. You screw just like your father.
well, I just dropped in to tell you
I've decided to retire and I'm appointing you president of the company.
and you, senorita, please feel free to continue.
I swear on my word of honor that I have not seen your face.
so, please.
Shh. Stop it.
you'll wake Fermina. It's Sunday.
it's Sunday today. You've... you've missed mass.
you haven't taken your communion for at least three weeks.
have you lost your faith?
doctor. -Yes.
look at me.
what? What is it?
her smell is in my nostrils.
I have the right to know who she is.
her name is Barbara Lynch.
how long has it been going on?
three months, nearly four.
where did you meet her? -She's a patient.
what is...
what is she, this... this patient?
a doctor of theology, a Protestant.
she has a mission by the harbor.
I thought at least you...
you'd be a man and deny the whole thing.
I thought at least you'd...
you'd lie to me.
I f... I feel as though a great weight has lifted from my shoulders.
I... I will put an end to it.
and I'll go to my confessor and ask for absolution.
come on, let's go, it's going to rain.
I have been waking in the early hours of the morning and then unable to go back to sleep.
and I have sudden stabbing pains in my chest.
worst of all, in the afternoons I...
I simply want to weep uncontrollably.
I think I am going to die.
that would be best.
then we could both have some peace.
bedtime, kids. Go.
we're going to eat our dinner, Aunt Fermina.
thank you. Thank you.
do you still recognize me...
the fat old thing that I have become?
it's been over a year and not a whisper, not a hint.
nobody knows where she is.
I have made myself believe that if she were dead
I would have heard.
all I can do to keep myself sane is to follow my routine:
472, Maria Florida...
sells flowers in the market.
499, Josephine Triola...
I-I don't exactly know who she was.
544, Galetia Fernandez...
nothing memorable to report.
routine is like rust.
I could stay here forever.
you should have come sooner.
you did the right thing...
teach him a lesson.
and what happened to the man who sent you all those telegrams?
Oh, he's very grand now.
president of the River Company of the Caribbean.
hmm. Do you still see him?
of course not.
and anyway...
he's not a man. He's a ghost.
it was all an illusion.
and you, Hildebranda, what happened to your married man?
he stayed married.
can I take care of your horse?
it is better to arrive in time than...
than to be invited, no?
Hildebranda. -Juvenal.
are your boots still killing you? -Thank you, God.
how good you are.
I must get the children ready for supper.
come on, kids. -I'll go first.
no, I'll go first. -I'll go first.
I'll go first.
what are you doing here?
well, I know you would be too proud to return on your own, so I have...
I have come to fetch you.
I... I thought we might have a second honeymoon.
but the following night, while the old man slept...
Oh, dear God, now what? -Shh, please.
shh, Fermina.
thank you, God. Thank you.
excuse me.
it's been a long time since I've seen her.
good evening.
and she has changed, Ricardo.
but, what was worst, is that her husband seemed younger than ever.
and I had this...
heaven forbid.
heaven forbid. And it made me realize that I have grown older too.
those stairs...
up and down those stairs will kill me.
uh, I'm not afraid of death, I'm afraid of old age.
so...
I doubt I will be coming here so often.
why are you so successful with women?
because they see in me someone...
guilty.
in need of love. Someone who will not...
my heart has more rooms than a whore house, Ricardo.
what number are you on now?
prepare yourself for a shock.
I'm on number 622.
impossible.
I speak the truth...622.
some time ago...
I forget exactly when...
uncle Leo asked me to keep an eye on the daughter of some distant relation of ours from Puerto Padre.
she was being sent here to college to become a teacher.
and then, little by little,
I won her confidence and affection.
and in due course, the doors of heaven opened to her.
her name is America Vicuna.
we see each other on Sundays.
we are quite open about our, what shall I say?
friendship.
for one thing, the difference in our ages places us above suspicion.
someone has died.
Huh-uh.
it's Pentecost.
no. No, it must be a...
a very big fish if they are ringing the cathedral bells.
america.
you must go back to college.
my driver will take you. There is something I have to do.
Fermina...
I have waited for this opportunity for 51 years, nine months and four days.
that is...
how long I have loved you from the first moment I cast eyes on you un... until now.
florentino Ariza...
get out of here!
get out!
florentino Ariza, you are a dreadful, insensitive human being.
how dare you enter my house on the day my beloved husband died and utter such monstrous, ridiculous sentiments?
you have put me in a mortal rage, which has caused me to think about you without wanting to.
do you understand?
I do not want to think about you. Stay out of my life.
go, donkey, go!
Hi, dear. Let's not waste time.
I don't want to see a movie.
do you know what I want to do?
before you go home, I have something to tell you.
pull over. Pull over, please.
I'm going to get married.
it's a lie. Old men don't get married.
who is she?
do you want to cry? -No!
I don't know who she is.
but whoever she is, she has ruined my life.
america, you must...
I don't want to hear it, Florentino.
I'm warning you.
please allow me to wipe the slate clean.
age has no reality except in the physical world.
the essence of a human being is resistant to the passage of time.
our inner lives are eternal, which is to say that our spirits remain as youthful and vigorous as when we were in full bloom.
think of love as a state of grace...
not the means to anything, but the alpha and omega.
an end in itself.
think of love as a state of grace...
not the means to anything, but the alpha and omega.
an end in itself.
the messenger is waiting for a reply.
mother, what is it?
someone wants to call on me.
who?
don Florentino Ariza.
the man who owns the riverboats?
you know what they say about him?
no.
they say he has never had a woman.
in fact, they say his tastes are quite the opposite.
they say he has a secret office where he takes boys he picks up on the docks at night.
I simply don't believe that.
I've known him since he was a boy.
he's an honorable man.
everything in the world has changed.
I haven't. Have you?
what does it matter now?
I've just turned 72.
Yes, we are two old people about to be ambushed by death.
do you believe in God?
no.
but I am afraid of Him.
some of your letters were a great comfort.
I'm glad to know you received them.
what... what I most admired about them was their simplicity.
they helped me a great deal.
in what way?
they helped me regain some kind of peace.
you cannot imagine how happy
I am to know that.
but I don't agree with everything you say.
we have nothing in common except memories.
the young people we were are banished...
that was all an illusion.
not for me.
I thought this might amuse you.
that must be 50 years ago.
at least.
I have something to say.
in my experience, when anyone says that, it's bound to be unpleasant.
these frequent visits from the man you are seeing are unseemly.
ofelia, it's none of your business.
he is company for Mama.
he consoles her. -Consoles her?
all he needs to do to complete his consolation is to climb into her widow's bed.
ofelia.
but don't you believe that love justifies anything and everything?
love is ridiculous at our age.
but at theirs, it's revolting.
the only thing that hurts me is that I don't have enough strength to give you the beating that you deserve for being so insolent and evil-minded.
but you will leave this house right now and I swear to you on my mother's grave that you will not set foot in it again as long as I live.
ofelia, Mama, let's not...
life crippled that poor man 50 years ago because he was too young and now you want to do it because we are too old.
what I'd like most is to walk out of my house and keep going, going, going, and never come back.
well, you...you could take a boat.
I might.
I might just do that.
I have one.
the New Fidelity.
it's...it's leaving soon.
it's eight days up-river, and five days on the return.
travel is good for the troubled spirit.
splendid vision of the Earth, passing, changing...
as we travel by.
come in.
are your quarters to your liking?
it is the Presidential Suite.
it was my idea to install it.
I wanted to call it the Honeymoon Suite.
do you want to be alone?
if I did, I wouldn't have told you to come in.
Juvenal is a good man. Is a good husband.
I can't imagine a better one.
but when I look back,
I suppose there...
were more difficulties than pleasure.
too many useless arguments.
too much anger.
maybe it's time...
to ask ourselves, with our strong desire to live, what to do with the love that has been left behind without a master?
it's incredible how one can be happy for so many years in the midst of so many problems, so many squabbles.
damn it.
and not really know if it was love or not.
go now.
not now.
I smell like an old woman.
I have never been happier in all my life.
Oh, my love What wouldn't I do for you Just to take you for a second Away from the world And close to me Oh, my love Like the Magdalena River That it melts into sands from the sea I want to melt into you There are love affairs That wait until winter to blossom And get greener at night in the fall Just like this love that I feel for you.
tomorrow we reach our last port-of-call...
la Dorada.
la Dorada.
and then...
turn back for home.
don't look.
why not?
because you won't like it.
I have waited for this moment for 54 years.
Yes. Yes, you...
you've told me before.
I have remained a virgin for you.
you're a liar.
captain, Captain. -Thank you, sir.
captain?
um, speaking hypothetically... -Hi, how are you?
hello.
speaking hypothetically, would it be possible to make the...
captain. -...return trip without stopping?
thank you. -Without cargo or passengers, without coming into any port...
thank you.
...without...without anything?
it's possible.
but only hypothetically.
as you know better than I, the company has contracts to fulfill.
but there is one thing that could be done.
what is that?
if we had a case of cholera onboard.
we'd hoist the yellow flag and be quarantined.
well then, let's do that.
I command this ship, but you command me.
if you're serious, just give me the order in writing and we will leave right now.
I love you, my crowned goddess.
we're going to stay like this.
you can't mean it.
from the moment I was born,
I have never said anything I did not mean.
and how long do you...you think we can...
stay like this?
forever.
forever?
after 54 years, seven months and 11 days and nights, my heart was at last fulfilled.
and I discovered, to my joy, that it is life and not death that has no limits.
I think of you every day I think of you a little bit more I tear my reason apart And I keep thinking of you And I keep thinking...
down the Magdalena Down the Magdalena I'm going to Cartagena I'm going to Cartagena I'm going, I'm going I'm going, I'm going I'm always sailing away I'm always sailing away Along with my woman Along with my woman Singing and singing Singing and singing Down the Magdalena Down the Magdalena I'm always sailing away I'm always sailing away Along with my woman Along with my woman Singing and singing Singing and singing Down the Magdalena Down the Magdalena Already many women Already many women Have crossed the river Have crossed the river Already in my memories Already in my memories Down the river Down the river Down the Magdalena Down the Magdalena I'm going to Cartagena I'm going to Cartagena Down the Magdalena Down the Magdalena I'm going to Cartagena I'm going to Cartagena Down the Magdalena Down the Magdalena I'm going to Cartagena.

many things had to happen,
I had to suffer, you had to suffer so much.
I existed because you existed.
now that I am at peace, tied to my roots,
I feel I no longer exist.
before THE REVOLUTION "Those who have not lived the years before the revolution cannot understand the sweetness of life." -- Talleyrand
a Sunday in April 1962, just before Easter, in Parma.
and yet I came to you, Church.
pascal and the Greek Cantos I held tight in my hand.
with new dreams the Resistance brushed away "the dream of the regions federated in Christ...
and its burning sweet nightingale...
damn those who do not know that this Christian faith is bourgeois, "in its every privilege, "every surrender, every subjugation.
that sin is nothing more than the crime of disturbing daily certainties, hated for fear and aridity.
that the Church is the ruthless heart of the State.
as if in a dream I find myself before the city's gates, the bastions, the toll gates, the bell towers like minarets, domes like hills of stone, the grey roofs, the open terraces, and below the streets, neighborhoods, the squares, the Square, and through the middle the river, the Parma, which divides the two cities, the rich from the poor.
and again the Square, so much in the city's center, and yet so close to the fields, that on some nights you can smell the hay.
the square, which feels like a walled arena when we're inside.
there, I move amid figures who are out of step, remote.
figures for whom only the Church existed before, in whom Catholicism has suffocated all desire for freedom.
these are my equals, the bourgeois of Parma, those of the midday Mass.
I wonder if they were ever born, if the present echoes inside them, as it does in me and cannot be consumed.
Clelia.
we had always gone steady, we were meant for each other.
but Clelia is the city.
Clelia is that part of the city which I have rejected.
Clelia is that sweetness of life which I do not want to accept.
Fabrizio!
I found her, she's here with her mother.
that's why, for a desperate and final act of love,
I searched all the churches, looking for Clelia.
I found her and I wanted to look at her for the last time.
what time is it?
three o'clock.
you must get a Party card.
because...
...it can come in handy for everything, politics, even poetry.
then whatever you do or say has a meaning.
if you make a mistake, your mistakes then have a meaning.
before I was in constant anguish, a kind of guilt feeling.
Cesare helped me overcome this cowardice. I'd like to help you.
don't leave home only to go back.
it's worse. Cesare's been waiting for me. See you tomorrow.
agostino!
go to the movies, they're showing "Red River"!
don't miss it!
people who run away from home make me laugh, the ones who want to escape.
Why?
because it's childish. What you're doing is too easy.
you reject yourself, complain, run away.
you have to struggle from within.
they want to gag you and you run. But there's another way!
which one?
I just can't do it.
leaving home is already a lot for me.
and don't laugh at me!
if you think your father is a thief, an opportunist, a hypocrite, - That your mother is stupid. - I never said that!
I understand. My father may even be a thief, and my mother stupid, poor woman, so dumb that she can't understand anything or anybody,
but you just shut up, understand, shut up!
what right do you have to judge others?
and you, what would you do?
what do you think you're doing?
the revolution?
stay there. This is for my father!
and this is for my mother.
and this is for me!
what's the matter? - Ah, wine is good!
come on, let's go to the movies and see "Red River."
no, you have to go see Cesare.
go, you can't be late!
go, he's waiting for you, go!
shit...
you look well.
so do you.
I like your hair that way.
look who's here! - Hi, Domenico.
welcome. How are you?
just fine.
did you have a nice trip?
how's the weather in Milan?
Antonio!
he fell asleep doing his homework.
how are you? - Fine.
I have to go out, I've got an appointment.
with your comrades!
comrades and cake too!
Yes, that's right!
see you tomorrow. Bye, Aunt.
don't be late!
right, bye!
it's useless, it won't fit.
you take it home.
we have to go.
who drowned? - Bertoli's son.
did you see it?
does it seem right?
he must have spoken to someone!
over here!
who are you calling? - My older brother.
William! I found a job.
where?
down there, as a bricklayer.
I'm soaked.
were you here before, too? - Yeah, I was.
then you saw everything. - Yeah, I saw it all.
there, where the water's deep.
we were here talking.
he was standing where you are.
he asked me: "Is the water cold?
at first yes, then you get used to it.
are you a relative? - No, a friend.
he said: "I just ate.""
just after you eat is alright, it's later that's bad.
coming!
those kids always swim after eating.
nothing has ever happened.
it seems that gentlemen are more delicate.
he stood there in his briefs...
and I laughed because his feet were freezing.
he went over there, by the pylon.
then he spoke to you.
did he tell you anything?
he said: "This is my first swim of the year."
what's your name? - William.
Enore? How old are you?
seventeen.
where do you live? - At the shacks.
Agostino was blond, with tousled hair.
it didn't look like hair.
it seemed more like the feathers of a canary.
he had a little blond goatee and fine features.
like a Norwegian, but with the eyes of a madman.
like one of those hitchhikers.
I'm still here, you know.
Agostino changes colleges every year.
even twice a year when he gets expelled.
his parents say all boarding schools are the same.
they're all good, as long as they're in Switzerland.
he's only twenty, but he's a living legend.
people said all kinds of things about him, he was like a myth.
even Agostino believed in his myth.
sometimes I use Cesare's words, in vain...
......in the hope that they are clearer than mine.
to think that not even I, with my pretense of being his teacher, have ever understood anything about Agostino.
he kept running away so often. Where did he go?
it was already a lot if he got to Bologna or Milan!
when he came back I lent him my books.
all wrong for him.
poor guy!
how he would suffer...if he saw all these people who've come to see him dead.
these acquaintances dressed in black.
let's go.
come, Fabrizio.
I'm not coming.
don't act this way!
go, I'll stay with him.
what are you doing?
nothing...
looking for a way out of here because you don't notice me.
what do you do all day in Milan?
nothing...
I transmit thoughts.
I never miss!
I play the triangle.
I take three baths a day.
I always cry...
...I always laugh.
the last time we saw each other was at another funeral.
we didn't talk, I left without saying goodbye to you.
you helped me with my coat, remember?
I've been in Milan all these years, where did you think I was?
sometimes they talked about you.
you were small and I was growing up.
I don't think I'll grow any more!
I don't like grown'ups, adults...
...they're never attractive.
I don't even like myself.
not even a bit.
neither do you! You don't listen, but you could at least look at me!
can you ride a bike?
of course, I used to race!
did you ever run away from home? - No need to.
it's enough to stay home when the others go out.
and if the others stay home...
...then one has to run away!
I was famous for such things.
but they no longer impress, everyone is used to them.
I'm sorry...
Agostino was blond.
his hair was like the feathers of a canary.
is that what you said?
I'd like someone to talk about me like you talk about him.
but it will never happen.
so I do it myself.
sorry.
these condolences take so long.
what do they say? The same old stock phrases!
why don't you like yourself?
why don't you like adults? - Who told you that?
I like them a lot.
tall, blond...
it's not true that I can ride a bike.
I fall off!
why are you so quiet? Talk!
don't look at me like that.
it's useless, what can I do?
I wanted to make you laugh!
stop thinking about it. Don't you understand?
if I tell you it is because I know!
even at the funeral... of my fath...
of your grandfather.
I had often dreamed of his death.
in the dream I died, too.
but I imagined it in a different way.
because reality is much worse.
one thinks about it...
...prepares for it.
one prepares...
...and then can't deal with it!
one can't take that kind of pain.
you'd have understood.
I didn't even dress in black.
I didn't think it mattered.
I was so close to him.
it's amazing how alive you feel close to death, how you cannot share...
...death with the dead.
enter with them into their coffin.
you feel more alive than ever!
you need to move.
to talk.
to move your arms, hands...
and I wanted to console you.
it's always wrong to go back.
things are never the same.
neither the people, nor the places...
what long afternoons.
how long the afternoons are in Parma!
tonight I go back to Milan.
all I have left now is Cesare.
at least he's here.
I feel like a pigeon in Piazza Grande.
the ones that peck under Garibaldi's statue.
Cesare is my Garibaldi! Even he has a pedestal.
I'll be all alone if you leave.
but you won't!
aunts should be respected and left free.
it's so hard to be understood!
you must stay for me, and for yourself.
alright.
I'll stay to learn Italian.
then I'll go.
forever...
but now you must pretend you need me.
it's a lie...
...but I'll do it.
aren't you coming?
you go, I'll stay in the sun.
I told Cesare you'd come.
No! Don't make me wait an hour.
I'll just say hello.
I saw you!
it's no use hiding. - I'm locked inside.
come down, or I'll tell your parents.
how can you? Everyone's gone.
there's nobody here.
I know you're there.
come out!
why don't you answer?
where did your boyfriend go?
why don't you comb your hair?
you look like a little witch.
you have such nice hair!
this is lovers-lane.
I know a nice place.
there are a lot of trees.
shall I show you?
Lucia weaves the linen, turns the paper and sees Harlequin!
harlequin jumps and dances...
will you teach me that?
how does it go?
it's Lucia who weaves the linen...
turns the paper...
...and sees Harlequin...
what's your name?
stop it!
stop it!
enough.
Gina, please! Talk to me!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
this never happened before.
I don't feel well.
I'm sorry.
first of all...
forgive me.
and please...
...don't ask questions.
I'm too sensitive, I'd feel as if I were in prison.
I don't know if you're just curious or if it's something else, something more.
I noticed that you noticed.
your face suddenly clouds over...
...then suddenly brightens up.
there is only one cure for my pain.
the others.
people... You.
the "medicine of boredom" brought me all the way here.
from far away Milan.
running parallel with the villas rushing by.
clouds chase other clouds.
you chase me chasing you.
my little nephew from Parma...
without saying anything I've told you everything.
don't ask questions.
don't ask questions...
my necklace!
what's the matter?
will it bring bad luck?
tomorrow I'll buy you a new one.
you even wanted to watch me dress.
while I put on my stockings.
and my panties.
how extraordinary!
did I disappoint you? Tell the truth!
don't be funny.
one can even love those things...
...which women usually hide.
your mother is taller, she's different.
forget it.
she's made like me.
Jesus, it's raining hard!
it's your fault too, you're a man now.
we're equal.
a rainy Easter... how boring!
when it rains at this hour I start tossing in bed.
why did you put your hand over my mouth?
did my moans upset you?
I didn't want them to hear us.
who could hear us?
there. If we're quiet we can hear the women get up.
what women? - The maids and grandmother!
are you crazy?
where are we? - In the back of the building.
it used to be a print shop, now it's empty.
I used to play here, alone.
I'm glad it happened here. Are you sorry?
No! - Do you want to go home?
No!
look!
come and see.
that name used to make me laugh.
it made me think of Laurel and Hardy.
I imagined he was a fat man.
Mr. Bodoni...
on Easter morning, the unleashed bells flew through the city.
they were sound asleep.
they continued to sleep:
a real scandal because in the house...
everyone was ready for Mass.
salan in prison confessed:
"everything crumbled around us!""
"general Salan in handcuffs was taken to prison."
suddenly...
Where's my wife?
Where's your mother?
she must be resting.
the ravioli came out better than at Christmas.
it must have been the filling.
one always eats too much in Parma.
first you eat and then you talk about what you ate.
a double effort, like eating twice.
today, Easter Sunday...
...many people in Parma won't even leave the table between lunch and dinner!
an eating marathon."
the farmers will be happy, it's raining again.
they never get enough, right, Mama?
she's out like a light!
I'm going to bed. Wake me at four.
now we can dance.
but I can't! - Come on, let's dance!
how should I dance? Like a dancing bear?
it's a "camera obscura," a trick with mirrors.
it's magic, but it's real. Still, it's magic!
I know you're happy, but it won't last.
Fabrizio, I feel it won't last.
it's useless...
in the end you'll remember me as if I were dead.
then after a while...
you'll forget me completely.
you'll end up hating me.
can I be blamed?
I never promised you anything and you can't blame me!
I love you.
I love you even though I'll never tell you.
you are a thousand ten thousand times better than me!
and I'm nothing.
I'm worthless.
I'd steal this trick which lets me talk to you when you're not here.
where are you?
did you like the film?
nice, wasn't it?
for "cinema'verite" it wasn't bad. In color...
here on Sundays they came to see...
the film about girls going to Mass.
then there was the fair...
...the acrobats, the dancing bears.
I wouldn't trade this moment for any other.
even if it's passing, I don't care. I'll forgive it.
I'm not like you.
I'm not brave, I'm a coward.
you'll never guess what I'd like.
I'd like it...
...if nothing were to move.
everything still as in a painting.
with us inside, still as well.
look.
no more May...
...June, July...
...August, September...
September! Who knows where we'll be in autumn.
I'm not coming! - You are coming!
you must follow me everywhere.
what a surprise, I didn't expect you today.
Gina, this is Cesare. - This is your aunt from Milan?
Yes, I'm the aunt from Milan.
the smoke, huh?
yes... the smoke!
Franklin stoves are all like that.
are we just going to stand here? - Excuse me!
come in the dining room.
No! Better not, it's in a terrible mess.
have a seat.
I know the girl who lives opposite.
in the tower? I know her, too, Evelina.
they rent it, they're poor.
she's a friend of mine.
what's there to drink? - I have some sweet white wine.
or some "Strega" or "Kummel."
no, it goes straight to my head.
have some wine. - It's like water, real light.
you'll like it.
you know, when I'm here...
I feel like I'm in my den.
Really?
you're the first person I've brought here, it's a privilege.
it doesn't work. - You sure?
it's broken.
watch.
you're stupid!
radio destroyer! It's not yours!
what are you doing?
certain people do things out of passion.
his vocation is teaching.
but he has understood that only children can be taught.
our teacher has explained to us that the word freedom-means justice and democracy.
on April 25th of last year Fascism ended and it's...
the only duty we have towards history is to rewrite it.
when we have fully understood the scientific laws which govern life......
we will find that the only person with more illusions than the dreamer......is the man of action.
but men are slaves of words.
they rage against materialism, "forgetting that there has been no material improvement...
which has not spiritualized the world.
and few have been the spiritual awakenings...
which have not dissipated the world's faculties...
with sterile hopes.
he also explained to us...
that we have democracy because partisans died...
and it will be difficult because democracy is like the fields...
which need to be tended to every day.
our teacher is from the city...
but he makes us write about the country.
"Essays......"
...and "problems," both misspelt.
he was a nice kid, from Fidenza.
intelligent, the one who understood the most.
you know, I'm naive.
for 17 years I have insisted on that essay on April 25th.
italians have never been able to understand these things.
rather, they can understand...
...but they quickly forget.
too quickly.
you were very young in '45.
were you already teaching?
it was my first year.
what a year '45! There was so much confusion in my head!
you're only good at putting order in other people's minds.
order...
I wouldn't know what to do with your order.
you take the world as it comes. - Life is not order.
it'd be terrible if it was...
we must not... we cannot accept it.
we want to change it. - What can you change?
you can't change a person.
not even one.
that goes for me too, because I'll never change.
you're out of step with history, because history is going in that direction.
history is time, isn't it?
nun, bride, widow, old maid...
...nun!
I know time doesn't exist. - That's beautiful.
but it's nothing new. You've read Proust and...
I know a story older than Proust.
once upon a time there was an old wiseman...
...like you...
...who had a young disciple... like him.
they wandered through the countryside.
one day the old wiseman said to the young man:
I am very thirsty, would you fetch me a glass of water?
the young man said: "Yes, I will.
he went down the road and came to a fountain.
beyond the fountain he saw a town...
...a wonderful town...
...which fascinated him.
in this town he met a girl, mysterious, extraordinary like you!
he married her, had many children and lived with her for 20 years.
cheat, you already knew it!
after 20 years a terrible plague broke out, everyone died and only he survived.
by that time he had grown old.
desperate, he began wandering through the country, he walked a lot...
and arrived where he had left the old wiseman.
and who did he see?
the old wiseman who was still sitting there...
and he said to him:
it really took you long to fetch a glass of water!
I've been waiting all afternoon!
time does not exist.
understand?
for the disciple a whole lifetime had passed.
while the old man was still waiting for his water.
wisdom has never prevented people from starving.
you're talking like a book again!
I thought you two always agreed.
of course! We argue because we agree.
I'd get bored.
well, I've understood that the only ones you can argue with are those who share your ideas.
I'm a chameleon, other people's ideas make me change color.
what does that mean?
maybe you are so sure of yourself...
that you can take everything in without losing anything.
you're right, I speak like a book.
I have to speak like a book to be convincing.
but don't forget that they're books you give me!
and I believe them.
do you remember Pavese? Maturity is everything.
a few days ago someone came looking for me.
my neighbours told me.
about 10: 30 in the morning, I was at school.
a boy with a bicycle, he didn't say his name...
they said he was blond... - A green bike?
I don't know, I could ask the neighbours.
it was Agostino.
Agostino came to see me?
I had promised to bring him to you, he was ready, anxious.
he always wanted me to tell him about you and our discussions.
he was ready.
he thought he hated everyone, instead he only hated himself.
it's as if he had killed himself.
it was an accident, you have no right to talk like that.
he lived alone.
he died alone.
the worst thing you can tell someone is you don't believe their pain.
Hello?
is that you?
Yes, it's me, Gina!
no, I swear I'm not in Milan.
I'm calling from Parma.
I received your letter. The weather is nice, we're fine.
stop the small talk!
look out the window.
it's already light.
it's almost 4 in the morning.
I'm in a room that's not mine.
waiting for morning to come!
no, I'm not well.
you know I can't stand being in small rooms.
this room...
...I don't know it!
it's so empty.
it scares me!
nothing but four white walls.
in my house near the bed, remember?
there's a lamp on all night.
there's no lamp here.
just an enormous chandelier!
it's your fault, you made me leave.
you're the one who sent me here!
it's not true that I can't live alone.
you had me under care, we had to continue!
I could come to you every day.
but maybe you...
...didn't want to see me anymore.
nobody knows me here!
I was in bed by midnight but instead of sleeping
I started hearing all the clocks in the city.
one, two, three o'clock... because I'm always here, awake!
there are also some kids who talk under my window.
they never go to sleep.
Yes, but who can hear me, this room is at the other end of the house.
I'm sorry, I must have also woken your wife.
it's almost dawn.
I don't think I'll ever be able to sleep in this house.
listen!
can you hear it?
a cart going by.
of course, I'm looking in the mirror.
a dishevelled monster.
I don't want to comb my hair.
I already told you.
if you could only see my face!
a bath? Now?
I don't feel like one.
you're saying that to get rid of me!
alright.
don't get angry.
please... do you think I can come back to Milan?
I'm opening the door.
don't hang up!
you'll let me come back? Can I come back?
it was about time, dammit!
where have you been?
I've searched half of Parma. - This is... what's your name, Carlo?
Luigi...
I went to Otello, to Alpi, under the arcades...
...everywhere.
woman IS WOMAN
he was able to invent a woman like that.
in 20 years Anna Karina will be what Louise Brooks is for us today.
she will represent an entire era, right?
that's the miracle of cinema for me.
nothing gives you a better feeling of 1946, than the Bogart'Bacall duo in Hawk's "The Big Sleep."
I'm boring you, right?
no, sorry... I was thinking.
in the cinema your mind was also somewhere else.
I don't even remember what film I saw.
I just went in, I'd been wandering around for an hour.
I arrived at 6. It's 10 now... I saw it twice.
I can't stand some films. - "Vertigo" 8 times.
"journey to Italy" 15, and you live without Hitchcock and Rossellini?
you're an addict! Are you putting me on trial?
you say that Resnais and Godard make entertaining films.
une Femme est une Femme" is more "engage"- than the films of Lizzani and even Rosi.
you're crazy! Explain yourself. Or are you having me on?
cinema is a question of style and style is a moral issue.
you're not listening, what's up?
I'm in love.
then it's a question of content.
and no longer of style.
it's never happened to me before,
I didn't know what being involved meant.
tell me.
I'm out of whack.
did you think love was a superstructure? A woman's a woman.
things happen in life which...
...we don't understand at first, but which are important and change us.
a tracking shot is style, but style is a moral question.
I remember a tracking shot by Nicholas Ray of 360 degrees, which is one of the highest moral moments, and thus "engage"', in the film history.
a 360'degree tracking shot... - You're a reactionary.
... 360'degree of morality. - Maybe I should laugh, but I can't.
I'm just a bore who rattles off lists of films, and tonight...
...you need to be alone.
maybe you're right. I'm off.
take my scarf.
it's cold out. - It doesn't matter.
I live close by! I want you to take it.
remember!
one can't live without Rossellini!
what are you doing here?
who are you waiting for?
why are you still awake? - Who are you? Hercules or Tarzan?
I wanted to come to your room.
to slap you around, punch you up!
I don't really care anyway.
me or someone else, it's the same for you.
you can do what you want, you're free.
you're free! I want you to know that.
it's over.
it's over.
no, I need to talk to you.
come to my room.
why didn't you hit me this afternoon?
the look you gave that poor guy...
who knows what he thought...
he wanted my phone number.
I promised to go and see a game with him on Sunday.
in Bologna.
then I lost interest in giving him my name and number.
so he felt cheated.
he got mad.
the things he said to me!
he said all those terrible things just for a Sunday.
he almost hit me because I wouldn't give him my number.
what do you think?
he was a respectable person.
a nice man, he said some beautiful things to me.
you don't believe me? Don't you believe it?
it's the truth.
you think I'm a liar!
why did I go with him?
I needed to talk with someone, because it's only right.
I'm not even sure what I'm saying anymore.
I'm such an asshole!
I talk about things that don't exist.
the truth......is that he treated me like men treat whores.
he was a moralist.
if he wanted to punish me he was right.
because I deserve it every day.
if there's a fire, I think it's my fault.
if a war breaks out, I think it's because of me.
if there's a storm, forget it.
if I run into the police I tell them I'm innocent right off.
he wasn't extraordinary.
one never meets extraordinary men.
besides, I hate men.
I hate them!
with their women, their children, their families...
I like you because you're not a man yet.
I write you to tell you that I've loved her for some time now!
if she likes me, say so. I can just see it...
to think that I'm here on holiday, and if a storm breaks and falls down on her and hurts her, just the thought makes me go cold and I remain affectionately yours, Massinelli.
as a boy I used to charm the frogs.
maybe that's even an insult.
go and charm the frogs!
friendly mosquitos...
maybe they recognize me. These mosquitos are strange!
they don't bother me.
my dear!
my dear friend.
my Puck!
as a child I didn't love you so much and yet you spoiled me.
now it's me who loves you.
and you... I don't know.
I don't know anymore.
little liar, you know I've always loved you!
let's put it to the test.
look into my eyes.
when something was up you were always the first to understand.
I have a secret.
a big secret.
if you try to guess it...
we won't be friends anymore.
instead look at my secrets.
the river bank, the pond and Padova, the painter...
...the only one I can still talk to.
down there the River Po, trying to hide, but you can always feel its presence.
so many people in a single day. I'm not used to it anymore.
I forgot to tell you, I'm being tailed.
Fabrizio, my nephew.
why did you come here? - Let go of me.
have you changed tastes? You're fast!
I'm coming!
these frogs... even some giant ones!
there are small frogs, but the ones I like the most are the...
...big ones!
it's so good to see you again, so much time has passed.
you haven't changed, you only look me up when you're in love.
and in the wrong way... - You're the same, too.
you knew it as soon as you saw me.
and it's all so wrong, all I can do is run away.
I didn't know you had a grown'up nephew.
he's from Parma, right?
you can tell right away... by the shoes.
you could always get English shoes in Parma.
even during the war, we'd cross the Po to buy them.
at the time we thought it was important to be anglophile.
what's his name?
this is good land, right?
it's good, but it's all mortgaged.
by May 5th I have to find the money for the bank.
it's the deadline.
how is that possible? Even the Lombardo Pond?
by this time next year...
who knows who will own the pond.
ever since my father died, five years ago, everything's gone to the dogs.
had he foreseen such a disaster...
I'm sure he wouldn't have died.
can you imagine me without my free meal?
what can I do?
go to work? I don't even know the meaning of the word.
my folks said I didn't need a degree, because I had land and land never betrays you.
so now I'm ignorant as a peasant!
I'd be ashamed to go steal a salary.
any job I did would be like stealing.
sponging a meal. - How have you eaten up to now?
false sincerity makes me laugh.
let it go.
it's easy to set your conscience straight when you're broke.
why didn't you do it when you had your free meal, as you called it?
you're so rude!
No! You're right.
we can talk openly, now you've staked your ground with me.
it's my fault, I've bored you with an unimportant case.
it's not an unimportant case.
there are too many cases like yours in Italy.
this is what you don't understand.
you don't understand what habit is, the habit of one's own predicament. That's why I'm not ashamed.
habit justifies everything.
fascism, Franco, racism... You can get used to anything.
but you say: "That is why I'm not ashamed."
you're stupid, conceited.
you talk, talk...
you think you know everything, but you don't know anything or anybody.
shut up, you can't talk.
no more river! Enough of the river!
one must forget it.
they tell us to bid it farewell. They order us to say goodbye to it.
they'll come here with their machines.
they'll come with their dredgers.
there will be different men.
and the sound of the engines!
the poplars... the vines...
who will make sure the poplars will grow without freezing?
the weeds.
nothing will remain. - The fish traps...
there will be no more summer. - The canals...
there will be no more winter. - The toads...
it's over for you, too!
get out of the way, retreat!
sink your boat!
I'm speaking for you, too.
we won't fish perch anymore.
we won't even fish carp.
and the ducks won't fly overhead.
they won't be caught in the sights of my rifle.
no more coots!
no more flocks of wild geese!
you see, my friends?
this is where life ends and survival begins.
and so...
...goodbye Lombardo pond.
Bye.
goodbye, rifle.
goodbye, river.
and goodbye... Puck.
what a pretty light.
we are all in it.
at that moment I realized that Puck had spoken for me, too.
I saw myself in him years from now.
I had the feeling that even for us, children of the bourgeoisie, there was no escape.
thanks for coming. - Shall we call a taxi?
let's walk if you don't mind.
have a good trip.
Why?
I'll come with you.
at the end of the summer, every year at Ducale Park...
communist FESTIVAL
I feel it's all wrong, even this way of having fun.
you've been going on all afternoon, what is it?
I shouldn't have to tell you.
I thought we spoke the same language, that we wanted the same things.
to have fun people want to see the singers up close.
that's why it's all wrong.
to think I spent half the summer at Party meetings.
everything's going to hell here.
hear about Marilyn? Poor thing...
who knows why she did it. - What did she do?
didn't you see the papers? - She killed herself with pills.
I don't believe it, it must be a publicity stunt.
there was a picture!
she was gorgeous.
I still don't believe it. - It was even on the radio.
the People take what you give them.
it scares me.
so long as we're the ones giving... - The people accept things blindly.
and if we're wrong?
we could have been wrong all along.
in fact, you were wrong.
I don't mean human errors...
...in 20 years the People have not forged a common conscience.
we have proof that a People's conscience exists.
very strong evidence!
I know what you mean, but the events of July '60 are not enough for me.
One'day revolutions won't do.
don't the struggles count, the strikes, union disputes?
strikes aren't enough for me, nor union activism, nor "May Days" with their red flags.
maybe in 1948.
who is willing to strike today for the liberation of Angola?
name one person who has fought in Algeria.
who takes to the streets now if they kill a black man in Alabama?
even taking to the streets isn't enough for me anymore.
I wanted a new man.
a world of siblings who are fathers to their fathers.
you know.
the proletariat has ideals, don't forget that.
the proletariat has only one irrational ideal.
it's not their fault, you allowed them to dream of bourgeois dignity...
and now they want to mix in with the bourgeois, dress like the bourgeois.
they want to understand bourgeois entertainment, bourgeois books.
workers want to improve their economic condition.
which seems right to me.
Enore? Where did you put the posters?
back there.
next to Castro.
what did the Party do for Agostino?
and what did you do for him?
you were sleeping and his death woke you up.
why expect the Party to do what you couldn't do?
just because I couldn't do it.
you're on the outside and believe you are more involved than most.
I know your sort... Your problem is something else.
if you had more courage you would talk about Gina.
you once lent me a book.
a phrase was underlined:
men make their history in an environment which conditions them.
you explained it to me as: "Men act...
in an environment which already exists.
men make their history, not the environment in which they live.
I am the negation of this theory.
we must open our eyes.
you wanted to change me and I hoped you would.
instead, I am a rock, I will never change.
I wanted to fill Gina with vitality.
instead I filled her with anguish.
she once told me slightly ashamed...
she had "nervous fever."
I have a different fever.
a fever which makes me feel nostalgic for the present.
while I live I already feel the moments I'm living are far away.
thus I do not want to change the present.
I take it as it comes, but my bourgeois future...
lies in my bourgeois past.
for me ideology has been a holiday.
a vacation.
I thought I was living the years of the revolution...
and instead I was living the years before the revolution.
because it is always before the revolution, when you're like me.
communists refuse to hide...
their opinions and their intentions.
they openly declare...
that their aims...
can only be achieved...
through the violent overthrow...
only through the violent overthrow of all existing social order.
the ruling classes tremble at the thought of a Communist revolution.
the proletariat has only its chains to lose.
it has a world to gain.
workers of the world, unite!
december 26, 1962 MACBETH opening of the opera season
Regio Theatre
are you coming to the wedding?
why shouldn't I?
what do you think of them getting married so soon?
they seem so young.
what does Fabrizio think? - He accepts everything lately.
he's changed so much.
at least let him get his degree.
he'll graduate, you'll see.
where is she?
the sixth box second row.
it's their family box.
one... two...
she's beautiful.
look.
you can't see Fabrizio.
he's hiding.
he's hiding behind her.
I'm so happy.
I was waiting for you.
I was looking for you.
she looks like an ancient portrait.
perfect for you.
everyone will envy you.
I know you don't like her.
she won't be like you...
...she won't understand a lot of things... but she's good.
so simple.
not much, but just what I want at the moment.
it's about to end.
we'd better get back.
this Macbeth is lovely.
I already saw it last year at the Scala, but here it's different.
it must be this theatre... maybe here the people really believe it.
a few years ago the idea of going to the opera made me laugh.
how boring Verdi is!
our beloved Verdi! I can't take him anymore!
after all, he's everything we are not. I hate him!
I prefer Mozart.
well... you arrived.
goodbye then.
it was better this way.
for you and for me.
there was nothing to do.
you know how I am.
you understood me better than anyone.
that's why you left, wasn't it?
it was right.
you decided for me, too.
I know how much I made you suffer.
don't think I don't know.
how cold it is in here.
could you fall in love with me now?
capitan Achab, I heard tell of Moby Dick.
wasn't it Moby Dick who took off your leg?
who told you that?" Achab cried.
Yes, Starbuck...
...and I will hunt it down beyond the Cape of Good Hope, "beyond Cape Horn, "beyond the great Maelstrom of Norway, "beyond the fires of Hell, before giving up.
and for this you have signed on, sailors!
"to hunt the White Whale the world over, in every part of the Earth, until it spits black blood..."
"and rolls over with its fins in the air."
come on! Get up, bastard!
the boss, teacher， and father are one.

Dusabu-ilche My Boss My Hero
Myeogdong is the bridgehead to Gangnam !
though Du-shik has taken over Myeogdong.
the area is too important for him - to be in charge! - I agree, boss!
these days, younger brothers have all graduated from high school and a lot of them went to college.
Du-shik didn't even finish high school!
please reconsider, boss!
good work in Myeongdong yesterday. - I owe everything to you, Big brother.
you know how to be modest. You've matured.
Byeong-hun, that son of a bitch. What a fool.
a mere subordinate and he dares to betray the family? Hopeless bastard...
have another drink. - Thank you, Big brother.
Hey, Du-shik! Do you have e-mail?
shit... you take me for a fool?
what's your e-mail address?
1 10-21 1 Seoul, Jung-gu, Myeongdong, 844 Eco Villa...
apt. 303.
what are you doing?
I'm setting up a cafe on the net.
cafe?
a fucking cafe? You can't make money off that shit!
big brother told us...
not to do anything that makes no money, dumb ass!
Hey, Head! - What? I'm only talking the truth!
do you know what the Internet is?
you think I'm stupid? - Do you e-mail?
I fucking mail this shit everyday!
I can mail this shit 12 times a day! 12 times, moron!
whatever.
that's what happened?
didn't the boss of the Jongro family go to college?
it seems people who went to college always think that they're better!
I've never said that. - Bull shit!
you were saying internet this, e-mail that, cafe this and that, you liar!
big brother, do you know what a net cafe is?
is it in our district?
you're really ignorant, Big brother!
he said, "Is it in our district?"
why is Head always like that?
that sort of thing is unimaginable in Las Vegas.
you've been to Las Vegas? - No.
you have no basics, moron!
you have to have basics, punk!
write your name.
seriously, Big brother.
in Chinese characters.
I'll leave Myeondong open till year's end, just get your high school diploma.
then, if anyone has any problems with that, I'll take care of it.
do you understand?
yeah... Big brother.
the cops are all over the Myeongdong incident.
head, you must run the business and take care of our family in the boss's absence.
where are you going, Big brother?
big brother will be gone for a while
big brother! You can't go to prison!
I'll go in your place!
we should be going. - I'll go instead.
really, Big brother.
Thanks.
big brother... - Instead of school, how about a private learning institute?
private institute? - My cousin goes to one...
in Noryangjin. That's where the best institutes are.
they have great teachers and high college acceptance rates!
Really? But... Do Institutes give out diplomas?
if you give them money. - Oh !
the world has become a better place to live!
let's have a round of applause for our improved educational system !
come on, come on, come on !
so, the first half should be focused on Korean, Math and English, and the second half on the overall general curriculum for the final spurt!
that's it! Spurt! Spurt is important! But... what's a general curriculum?
I lowered your age. Born in 1981, 20 years old.
20 years old?
people often say that you look like you're in your early twenties.
I do look young for my age.
it would be difficult to enter public schools, so I looked into private ones.
I found a private school with a good reputation and competent teachers.
Really? - Sangchun High School in Gangnam.
you've been admitted by way of contribution.
contribution? What's that?
you gave, and you took.
also, the important thing is... it's co-ed.
big brother!
I've looked into a great place, institutes with high rates in...
Noryangjin! - It's the best, Big brother!
high rates and good teachers, and...
general curriculum ! - They give out diplomas!
and...
how do I look?
something wrong?
nobody slicks their hair back in high school these days.
Gye Du-shik Enters High school
congratulations, Big brother!
what the fuck is this?
big brother! I'm so proud of you.
ask if you don't know, moron. You have no basics.
repeat after me, basics. - Basics!
fuck, you have no basics!
who bought this bag?
what?
I did, Big brother!
I had to get you something with you going back to school and all.
big brother, that bag... is made in USA.
and these pants?
how many times do I have to tell you, moron?
lips!
I told you to ask me many times if you don't know!
just ask!
big brother, I'll get you a backpack by tomorrow.
how can I trust him to run things?
stop the car over here.
it's too far from school...
just pull over! If I say pull over, just pull over!
it's stuck.
it smeared, darn...
Hey, you!
hold the gate!
Hey, Head! - What? I'm only talking the truth!
do you know what the Internet is?
fooling around with the students.
hello. - Good morning, students!
let's go. We've got a lot of collecting to do today.
isn't that right, Dong-pal?
right, Gyeong-sil? Right? Answer me!
who are you?
I just transferred today.
you should have told me!
it's okay. Get up. Stand up, it's alright.
I said get up, you punk!
have you lost your mind? Have you no manners?
being late on your first day! You have no basics!
that motherfucker! Come here! - Be quiet.
I'll take responsibility! Call the whole family!
you scared me, bitch!
how can a girl have so much leg hair...
why do you keep coming to the women's restroom?
go to the boy's room, sissy!
are you crazy?
if I were doing this in there, they'd beat the shit out of me!
freak... you think that'll straighten out your frizzled hair?
you're insane... - You talk way too much, sister.
don't worry about my hair. Just worry about your own tight hairstyle.
Kyeong-sil. Do you have any pads? - Hey, Yun-ju.
anyhow, you girls are way too sloppy.
Thanks. I'll get you back. - Only the 'White' brand !
what? Don't be looking at me like that, sister.
freaks and geeks.
chain smoking bitches.
hope you all get lung cancer and rot. So annoying...
what did you just say? - What did I do?
you wanna die? Wanna die, punk?
what?
retard! - Why'd you hit him?
I pity your parents who I'm sure were happy when they had you.
Hey, Ji-hye. That's a bit harsh!
don't be upset.
Hey, seeing you up close, you look really poor.
what's going on !
you girls can go.
why are you picking on those girls?
are you hoodlums? Are you gangsters?
you don't study and you're picking fights.
you little brats!
are you out of your minds?
Mr. Jo! - Yes.
please come here. - Yes.
sure. Have they been causing trouble?
what have you kids done? - Don't worry, they were fighting among themselves. I'm just giving them a notice.
Mr. Jo, this is the new student. He'll be placed in your class.
this is your homeroom teacher. - What's this?
white? !
what ya looking at, punk?
have you all eaten?
my name is Gye Du-shik. Pleased to meet you, everyone.
settle down. Is there an empty seat?
over here, Mr. Jo. This one's empty!
Du-shik, go sit over there.
who had clean-up duty yesterday? - The third row.
I'm surprised that the classroom is so clean.
now, we'll begin where we left off yesterday.
fighting! Sang-du !
to me?
that's right!
what the hell...
solve the problem !
social Tatoo-ism?
you think you're a gangster? Huh? You brat!
Hey, Du-shik!
come here.
you have a rat in there or something?
what's this? A rat tail? - Stop!
fuck you! I'll rip your damn pupils out!
nobody slicks their hair back these days.
true!
you're better off slicking it back.
heard you were set back 2 years.
yeah...
I was set back a year, which would make you a year older than me.
Oh, really? - What? Call you Big brother?
there's no need for that...
so what's your story?
Yes, M'amm ! "you should work hard !"
you must've been shining shoes or delivering food... am I right?
a gangster.
what?
I was a gangster.
you punk! If you were a gangster I'm the freaking Godfather!
you crazy? - Are you out of your mind?
what an idiot!
is this it? - That's all that I have.
you disrespect, disregard, disdain, discount and defy me?
you little... You think I'm a bum? Huh?
if I find a single coin on you, - I'm gonna burn your little rat tail! - Really, this is all I have.
search him !
why you gotta make trouble?
and be thorough!
teachers are coming! Let's go!
come here, moron. You're one lucky bastard!
you got something on your shirt. What's on your shirt? Moron!
Hey, bring a carton of cigarettes tomorrow!
lights for me! - Shit.
a gangster? What a moron...
do you work today? - Pretty much everyday.
take it easy. What you gonna do with all that money? Buy us dinner!
have you no shame? Always trying to live off other people's wealth !
shut up, you're so annoying.
no red beans in this.
Bye. - See you tomorrow.
Oh... this?
our eminent chairman's mother-in-law died.
lady! Give me a carton of cigarettes.
what?
Hey! Give me a carton of cigarettes!
you little brat!
who the hell you think you are?
get out of here! - Don't worry, I'm not a student.
then what are you, a gangster?
get out! Get out of here!
you're gonna disrespect us again?
you think we're that easy, huh?
Hey! You're mad, huh?
so what you gonna do? Take a swing?
stand up straight!
stand straight! - Friends!
you know what that is? That's your mother laughing at you!
friends?
you think we're friends? Well, this is how I treat my friends!
had enough?
here's more! - Hey! Friends!
I really have to graduate this year. Please.
I know how you feel. I really do. I've been there. Really.
just do me a favor, one last favor.
let's just all get along.
Yeah, yeah... Okay.
okay, friends.
suck this! I can't get along with you!
moron! - You crazy?
get along? Crazy moron!
later, moron!
was that for real? You tick me off, moron! Crazy nut! Jerk!
that bastard's nothing without a stick. What a poser.
bring it on! - Yes, Big brother.
big brother, there's a phone call.
what the hell... I'm bleeding.
Hello? Big brother!
what?
lunch?
Oh, my god!
may I help you?
do you know Gye Du-shik?
Yes, he's the one that cut class this morning...
well, I'm his uncle...
he forgot his lunch today.
he's so forgetful.
I'll give it to him.
well...
may I ask a rather forward question?
excuse me?
have you had lunch?
Damn! Check out moron's lunch!
shit! You must be rich, moron!
all my mother ever gives me are rice cakes.
this is good! Why don't you eat, moron!
please try some of this.
no, thank you. I can't eat pickles.
Really?
I'm allergic.
you're from Algeria? - No, I have an allergy.
right, allergy!
Yes.
I know someone famous for elegy.
who?
don't you know the singer? The queen of elegy?
lady... Came... llia...
I don't know her.
if you ever have any trouble, call me.
if by chance...
someone doesn't pay you back borrowed money...
or you become a victim of credit card fraud, call me right away.
I am a boy. You are a girl.
you are a girl.

they didn't have this in my days.
verbs and shit.

you've never seen a person buy books before?
I am a boy. You are a girl.
they didn't have this in my day!
shit! What the hell am I doing?
let's just buy something! Like you'd know anyway.
the boss ordered us to be thorough.
thorough?
like he's ever gonna look at these books.
they have academic scholarships, so Yun-ju will be able to go to college.
don't worry.
I'll make sure she goes to college.
please, trust me. - Thank you, sir.
get the car ready! Big brother's about to leave.
big brother!
could I speak to you for a second? - What is it?
english has become essential in today's global society.
that's correct.
so I'm asking you...
could you please give this to your English teacher?
you're out of your league. - Big brother!
I went to college.
damn... motherfucker...
you little retard...
what are you doing?
well, this... - What's this?
it's too small...
I'm sure that you are all aware that our Sangchun Foundation also runs a general hospital among other things.
however, the Urology department has been in deficit for some time.
so, we're going to encourage all students to receive circumcision.
is it free? - How would the Foundation survive if it were free?
why did a young kid like you do this to yourself?
it's completely covered with beads.
what's that? - Sunflower.
doctor. - What?
you forgot the anesthesia.
let me go! Let me go! Help me!
please excuse me for just a moment, but I've got something to say.
I want to tell you about an incident that happened 5 years ago the Seojin Room Salon murders which I'm sure many of you remember. I...
Hey, stop the bus!
open the door! - Are you sure?
we're not sure yet, but we'll need to look into it.
I'm positive!
he was in a school uniform but I'm sure it was Du-shik!
do your best for your success!
I love Jesus, love Jesus... Jesus Christ, hallelujah!
Yes, I'm his father.
where did Sang-du attend college?
college? What college?
he was expelled from high school!
he's fucking liar! Sang-du !
why can't you make the profit from a great location like this?
tell me, you bastard !
big brother, it's all my fault.
I didn't properly teach my business know-how to Sang-du.
that's my fault. That's was the biggest mistake.
Hey, hey... Isn't that Du-shik?
you morons, I should just...
everyone inside! Hurry up! - Big brother! It's my fault!
inside! Inside! - It's really my fault, Big brother!
come on! - Big brother...
it's all my fault, Big brother!
moron, what do you think you're doing?
I can't believe this. - Look at you, all dressed up.
suit and tie, hair slicked back...
what are you looking at? - You work here?
shit! You punk ass moron... - Who plays here?
mustache? - Right.
Wow! I really like him.
Hey! Sing one of his songs!

sing!
be congenial! Smile and sing, moron!
a swallowtail butterfly...
in the garden..." - Dong-pal! It's the cops!
I can't believe you really sang! Dumb ass!
shit!
why won't you follow orders?
when were you told to bring the fee for your graduation album?
and you two... you haven't paid the supplementary class fees!
how many months? One, two, three...
are you two conspiring this? Are you?
are you being defiant? Are you !
Oh, Mr. Jo! - What's going on?
take your seats.
Mr. Jo, it isn't that... - I said take your seats!
open your books!
what's with Ji-hye's Math grades?
how is she going to get a scholarship with grades like this?
who's her Math teacher?
Mr. Jo... - Christ...
you know how hot-tempered he can be...
do you think that I don't have a temper?
that jerk is good for nothing. Nothing!
if he can't collect money, the least he could do is cooperate in these affairs.
nothing - Nothing
you!
come here!
Oh, shit!
leave!
I said leave!
it wasn't me. - Then who was it?
kim Ji-hye. Come out!
come out now!
fucking bitch...
take your hands out of your pockets!
stand straight!
what did you just say?
nothing!
how can I even come to school anymore, mom? I was so embarrassed!
do you know how much it hurts? It still hurts really, really bad !
you might have passed the physical test if you weren't so weak.
you bitch !
how dare you...
how dare you hit my precious child, bitch!
come here!
crazy bitch! Why did you hit my child? How dare you, bitch!
I never even hit her! Who the hell do you think you are?
look! - Who the hell are you?
how's a child going to learn anything if the parent is this way!
students are hit only when they deserve it!
this is a school! - Misbehave?
you think I'm the one who's misbehaving!
what mother would like to see her child - beat up like a dog! - Nonsense, nonsense!
you're only a teacher! Don't stand up to a parent!
I'm sorry. - You're sorry?
do you know who she is?
do you know who her husband is?
what are you staring for! Jerk...
you want to be fired? You think I won't do it?
get out of my sight!
you're just a pathetic teacher, cocky bastard!
what do you think you're doing!
what on earth is this place! Is this a school?
no matter how rotten education may have become, how can a parent come in an uproar and rage violence against a teacher!
how can teachers ever teach if we're scared of what parents might think!
who was that?
yang Gyeong-jik, up front!
right now!
you think it's funny? - No, it's not that...
it's not what? - Tarzan over there...
you want to play jokes, huh? You think that's funny?
stand straight, you damn fool!
I said stand straight!
you think that's funny? I think so, too!
you stupid ass! - Stop it!
what the fuck?
what did you say?
what did you just say?
what the fuck...
fuck?
you little jerk!
shit! I'll just fucking quit school! So you're the teacher, huh?
does that give you the right to beat students?
shit. You wanna go one on one?
I'll fucking kick your ass!
call the cops!
call the fucking cops!
you little brats!
you have no fucking manners!
how dare you defy a teacher!
if I catch any one of you disrespecting a teacher,
I'll slice you up real good... with a kitchen knife!
do you fucking get me? You little brat!
what did you say about a kitchen knife?
do you always get off this late?'
get off this late? Go home this late? Get off...
go home...?
excuse me...
aren't you Ms. Lee?
what a coincidence...
well... I'm thirsty.
sorry about earlier.
but you were wrong.
as an old proverb says that "students don't even step on a teacher's shadow."
have you heard of 'Dusabu-ilche'?
don't you mean 'Gunsabu-ilche'?
it means that the boss teacher and father are one!
understand?
they look like students but they're drinking alcohol.
that's unimaginable in Las Vegas.
you've been to Las Vegas?
wow, a big boat!
study when you can.
you'll know what I'm saying when you get older.
fuck! Then why don't I know?
that was a legitimate blow.
I think that he was slightly off.
pay back my money if you have money to spend on liquor, punk!
I told you that you'd be dead if I saw you, didn't I !
looks like they're gonna fight.
they don't know what they're getting into.
you little punk, I told you to stay home, bitch !
what do you think you're doing?
I'm so scared! Oh my God, I'm so scared!
who are you? You with him? You his friend?
I think it was legitimate this time.
he got him pretty good.
I told you to stay home! Stay home!
you! Come here.
Yes, sir!
Why? You wanna fight me?
this is just like a movie.
I'm sure we'll soon be on our knees, begging you for your forgiveness.
you fight well? Come on!
go for it.
come on!
I'm bleeding! Son of a bitch! So you like to sucker-punch, huh?
fuck! Don't touch me!
stay back. And don't touch me.
so you've learned how to fight, motherfucker? Get him !
looks like he's flying.
the technical term is 'action scene'.
action scene...
little punks! Students should be studying, not fighting! Are you gangsters?
are you? - Huh? Huh?
are you gansters? Want me to bring gangsters?
wanna fight gangsters? - One on one?
you wanna go one on one?
please. - What?
please forgive us. - What do you think they're saying?
do you want me to go ask?
why don't you understand? You're killing me.
what's the big deal with changing one student's grades?
I've already told you. If I change Ji-hye's grade,
Yun-ju won't be able to receive a scholarship!
the grades will be changed!
look at this. And you call yourself a homeroom teacher?
your class's grades are dead last.
you're too weak. That's why...
students and parents...
I'm going to leave, sir.
ms. Lee!
you don't have a clue.
this country is filled with teachers!
do you understand what am I saying?
look into a new English teacher.
why can't women teachers last a year?
but Ms. Lee is a very competent...
what happened with Ji-hye's grade?
he won't do it. - Bastard.
Yun-ju, Bong-pal says to come.
I mean... Mr. Jo is calling for you.
you better study harder because you're skating on thin ice.
if you can't get a scholarship, who are you going to resent?
how many hours do you sleep these days?
6 hours... - Sleep less!
how does a senior expect to go to college...
on 6 hours of sleep a night!
if you play and sleep as others do, how are you going to get ahead?
do you understand me, Yun-ju?
this element consists of plutonium and alloy, so an easy way to remember is PLAY. "Play.
what did I just say?
you wanna play?
yeah?
you like me, don't you?
if I marry you, will you send me to college?
I'm just kidding.
Hey, Du-shik!
yeah? - Buy me a drink.
students shouldn't drink...
what's going on... uncle?
ms. Lee was a bit upset today, so...
so you two knew each other...
uncle? - It's not that, Big brother.
I mean... We met when I brought your lunch!
here. Have a drink. - I'm fine, Ms. Lee.
don't worry. It's okay for you to drink with a teacher.
well... uncle.
is it okay for me to drink?
sure, you're a grown man now. My little nephew!
the results of the audition will be e-mailed to each one of you.
you! What's your e-mail address?
address? - Of course.
be prudent. - Yes, sir.
what is it?
seoul, Seongbukgu, Donam-dong... - Fuck on you!
get outta here, dumb bitch!
you know what ticks me off more than anything?
bitches like that!
bitches with a face but nothing upstairs. Dumb bitch!
ignorant bitch! Don't even know email!
your address!
it's y8090@and. net. - Excellent!
that's it! That's how you do it! Be prudent!
at then what? - and-dot-net.
@and-dot-net!
you stupid dumb ass!
I told you to be prudent!
she said 4 dots!
right? Right?
shit, so you can sing a pop song?
translate it to Korean.
Oh? When did you get circumcised!
what happened to your beads?
college boy... Your pronunciation is so awful...
if you keep seeing Ms. Lee, it'll complicated things, so forget her.
love knows no boundaries.
did you learn that in college? - Big brother, it's not that...
little bastard... Get rid of your beads!
get rid of your beads, asshole!
get rid of your beads, asshole!'
did you have fun?
I couldn't stop laughing because of your uncle!
what's this? - This? 'Star Shot' Photo Studio.
star Shot Studio'? - You can take pictures like models.
come on... - Who is she, Big brother?
Why? You gonna hook us up?
big brother. Not only would I hook you up,
I'd grab the bitch and set her down right here and get you laid! Bang!
spin her sideways and backward and forward...
that bitch will be satisfied...
Hey, stop! - and upside down...
I told you to stop, moron!
the ladies are ready.
fucking asshole!
Really?
Yeah, you retard.
when did you start working here?
is it for money?
it's none of your business!
I'm not finished.
your family is rich, right?
lend me some money.
so I can go to college like everyone else.
I'll pay you back.
the girls here tell me, that a few months of hard work will pay well.
you don't want to lend me money?
wanna go to a motel?
but you know...
I'm expensive 'cause I'm underage! - You need to get yourself together!
I need money to go to college!
I want to go to college...
and grad school...
I want to study abroad...
it must be nice to be rich, you jerk!
what? An investigation?
I just want you to look into things.
the damn school collects money from students all the time...
shit! Parents beat up teachers.
that really happened?
you didn't know? Ms. Lee was a victim !
you know her.
who? - Ms. Lee.
are you serious?
what kind of motherfucker!
bastard, fucking bastard...
ms. Lee!
ms. Lee! - Head !
back to your position. - Yes...
Hey, guys! There is a big problem !
Mr. Jo... is resigning!
who said that? - Maybe you've heard wrong.
when it's an irrational expression in relation to variable X, then this function is called an irrational function.
Mr. Jo! - What?
is it true that... you're resigning?
don't worry! Just worry about your studies.
...equals -X,
y equals X-1 +1...
Sangchun Foundation has relations with the Myeongdong Family.
what?
the principal, Sang Chun-man runs a golf course, a shopping center...
they were recently taken over by the Shin Gang-nam's gang.
go on.
Byeong-hun of the Myeongdong family is working for the boss, Shin.
that bastard?
I'm sorry. I didn't know that.
fortunately, they don't know of your identity, so graduating won't be a problem.
shit... Straighten your head!
how does the principal have a golf course, a villa and a Mercedes-Benz?
can he afford all of that on his salary? - Exactly.
Yeong-shik said he saw a secret book in his safe!
something's fishy! - I knew it.
Hey, guys! It's a big news!
our school collects over several hundred dollars every month...'
on the pretext of supplementary class, books and other things.'
teachers are fired for having a conscience...
Yes. Yes. Please take care of this for me, just this once.
where has this been posted?
not only in the Department of Education's website, but the Board of Audit and Inspection, and the President's homepage.
damn it! Who the hell is it!
by the looks of this, it doesn't seem like teacher...
Where's Lee Yun-ju?
come here!
get up! I said get up!
get up, bitch! Get up!
are you planning to destroy this school?
my loving students...
can you understand how hard it was for us to collect money when we knew how difficult it was for your families to just make ends meet.
can you understand the inner conflict you feel when the boss tells you to raise a student's grade and in the end, you bury your conscience as a teacher...
because of fear of the consequences.
bring back my friend, Yun-ju! - Bring her back!
come out, Sang Chunman!
as teachers in the classroom, we teach knowledge and how to live life...
in shame, because our conscience knows the truth. Can you understand...
until we meet again.
always be pure and bright, and study hard,
who's going to take responsibility for students who are involved in this?
do you think those teachers are going to take responsibility?
you can't be serious! Are you really not coming out?
Du-shik, a lot of kids won't participate if you don't.
aren't you even angry? You disappoint me.
Yun-ju is your friend! - Retards...
if I were you... - Let's just fucking go!
and you call yourself a man! We're wasting time, come on!
dumb bitch, why does she even like such a selfish coward...
God damn you! I'm never ever gonna see you again! Never!
little brat!
where in hell do you think you are?
Sangchun Foundation has already influenced the politicians.
Plus, the school didn't do anything illegal.
private schools have the right of appointive power of teachers.
if we step in, things could get really bloody.
that's why I need for you to find a way!
how can we just stand and watch?
this is a school, not a night club!
why are you risking the chance to graduate over such trivial matters?
you call this trivial?
the school fired teachers because they wouldn't take foul orders!
the school beat and expelled a girl who would do anything to go to school!
you're just gonna sit and watch? Tell me, moron!
you graduate in a few months.
when you do, all of Myeongdong is ours!
you're being thoughtless because of your emotions!
please think of all of your younger brothers who depend only upon you.
that's correct, Big brother.
I just did the calculations.
look at this.
I added up all the tuition and fees of every student, and it's only half of what our night club makes.
I think what Sang-du is saying is on the money.
what's on the money, moron!
stupid, dumb fuck! - Be cool, Big brother.
the boss Shin's power is peaking, and his syndicate is all over the country.
please don't get yourself into this.
get out of here! Where do you think you are?
don't agitate the students and go home!
what kind of school is this?
what do you think you're doing?
haven't you disgraced this school enough ! are you out of your minds?
have you no conscience?
please get your head straight!
get them out of here!
bastard ! who the hell do you think you are?
cocky bastard !
fuck!
what are you doing!
go home. Go home.
go home!
you bitch!
what are you staring at, bitch!
Sang-du. We're taking over Sangchun High School.
what? Who are these guys?
big brother!
are you okay, Big brother?
do I look okay to you?
what the hell did he come here for?
leave this school, Sangchun Foundation !
leave this school, a corrupt Foundation !
who are these clowns?
wow, bunch of men in black!
leave this school, Sangchun Foundation!
are you okay, Big brother?
move, fast!
look at him. Does he look okay?
he's bleeding...
shit! I didn't get hit.
I was looking at the clouds, you know! Just clouds... Motherfuckers...
what... It's broken.
Du-shik? You okay?
watch out!
shin Gang-nam, let's keep it simple and go one on one.
that was a legitimate blow. - He got him pretty good.
stand up!
Ah, sorry!
does that hurt? - It kills...
big brother! - Get off me! Don't touch me...
what's that? - That's called 'tag'.
tag...
Hey, come out.
Yeah, you!
no weapons!
stop! Stop, asshole!
Sang-du! Are you okay?
it kills... oh...
what did I tell you, kid? I told you, you're nothing without a stick...
you're turn.
what are you doing? Get out of my way!
this is unimaginable in Las Vegas.
bastard!
shit! Don't hit my head!
stand straight!
bend your neck!
you're all dead.
I passed the qualification examination for high school graduation.
you must've only studied in prison.
I owe everything to you, Boss. - Good work.
thank you, Boss.
how is school?
I became class president. - Congratulations, Boss!
you know...
I wanna put you in charge of Gangnam, but many are objecting. It's because of your academic background.
but I graduated high school.
most younger brothers in Gangnam have been to college.
it's a cruel reality.
you're not possibly suggesting that I go to college, are you?
write it in English.
that's easy...
did I tell you to write your name?
what? Then...
you're not possibly suggesting that I go to college, are you?
Yes, Boss...
go to college!
thank you, Captain, Mrs Ainsworth.
can't I come to the station?
I'm not that brave.
Oh, my darling Lizzie.
simple ART OF MURDER
the MURDER AT THE VICARAGE
my egg was hard again, Mary
blame the chicken.
no.
Oh, no.
Yes.
Dennis...
must you, on a Sunday?
Sorry,Uncle Leonard, but she's playing up.
you can't go to church like that.
Oh, I'm not anyway. This could be a long job.
Mary!She won't hear you.
can't even boil an egg!
she's all we can afford, you old misery.
you knew I couldn't cook when you married me.
and you knew I was old.
look at the time!
Oh.
morning, Miss Marple.--Good morning.
how did you manage that, Griselda?
he'll be early for once.
I shall tell you this evening, Jane.
and bring some your damson gin over
it might take the edge off Mary's cooking.
# The summer days are come again #
# Once more the glad earth yields #
# And deepening shade of summer woods #
# And glow of summer air #
# And winging thoughts and happy moods #
# Of love and joy and prayer... #
but every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust and enticed.
then, when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin, and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.
here endeth the lesson.
stop wriggling, Lettice!
it's Letteece.--Everyone calls you Lettice.
you're not everyone, Lawrence.
behave. Don't forget where you are.
steady.
you should be on a calendar.
we could hang it in your father's study.
Oh, Lawrence.
get an eyeful, creeping around?
she's in her bathing suit.
mr Redding's an artist.
it's like looking at a bowl of cherries for him.
until she takes it off.
you've got an oily nose.
last Sunday's collection in aid of the Church of England Missionary Society, a total of 18 shillinga 11 pences. Well done, everybody.
that can't be right.--What?
the society benefits enormously from the efforts we make.
I put in a pound to myself.
I have here a letter of thanks from the secretary.
Colonel...
Yes, Marjorie?
there's something wrong... --What?
Shh!
What?--Shh.
you are quite sure?
I always put a pound note into the box on the anniversary of poor Bruce's passing.
I know, but perhaps this time...
come on, Miss Marple!
if Marjorie says she put a pound in then she did, so where's it gone?
I thought you'd be straining at the leash to sniff out the culprit.
you do have a reputation to maintain.
my reputation, Colonel Protheroe, if I have one
how kind of you to suggest I do - is neither here nor there.
I merely wonder if it's too early to talk of culprits.
Nonsense!--Lucius.
Anne, don't paw me.
now, look. I'm a church warden, and I was in intelligence.
I know when something smells fishy.
it could be the tip of the iceberg. Vicar!
Jane, shall we try the Toby Jug tomorrow just for a change?
good idea.
Where's Lettice this morning?
mr Redding's painting her.--On a Sunday?
Mm-hm.--You don't think...?
he does have a way with him, but she's just a girl.
I'd plump for an older candidate if there is somebody.
don't forget, ladies, tea and scandal tomorrow at 4: 30.
and I've invited Mrs Lester.--I'm coming!
perhaps we'll find out a little more about her.
something would be a start. Fancy staying at the Blue Boar.
not very homely for her.
very well-stocked, if you take my meaning.
Oh? --Tipsy at the jumble sale.
why the dear vicar had to choose such a shallow wife and at his age too...
I expect to see a full set of parish accounts or I'm going to take this matter further.
yes? Is that quite clear?
Yes.--Tuesday. Vicarage, 6: 15 sharp.
I know what you mean.
Colonel, any news of your architectural sleuths?
Yes, Dr Haydock.
they arrived last night.
they'll be taking photographs and making drawings. Still
one of the perils of owning an important house like Old Hall.
good day, Doctor.
what a dreadful, dreadful man.
I'll walk, Daddy.-- No. Get in.
how's the portrait coming along?
perfectly well, thank you, Anne.
Lettice...I thought he was painting you in that pretty blue dress of yours. - - Yes......
but today he was just doing my hands so I didn't bother to wear it.
what have you got in there?
nothing.
let me see.
come.
I-it's more artistic.
there's art and there's smut!
how dare he? And how dare you?
SSH, ssh.
don't shout, for goodness' sake.
I'll fight my own battles. Thank you, Anne.
I was thinking of our guests.
good morning, Professor.
do you have everything you need?
thank you, yes. Your so charming daughter was most helpful.
stepdaughter.
Ah, la Belle au Bois dormant, s'eveille.
je m'excuse, grand-pere. Good morning.
morning, mademoiselle. Lunch will be at half past twelve.
my husband's very keen to hear about your research.
we are flattered, aren't we, Grandfather?
not as much as he is.
permitting that sort of behaviour in your own garden, Vicar?
no, no. I mean it's...it's utterly unacceptable.
now, Mr Redding's telephone number, please.
isn't it gorgeous?
nothing quite so beautiful as an English summer's evening.
for our hostess? How lovely!
not as lovely as that stuff, I hear.
shall we?
Oh, thank you.
bless this food to our use and us to thy loving and faithful service nourished by the fruit of your earth and by the work of human hands.
may we render you true obedience, Lord and bend ourselves to thy will.
and make us ever needful of the minds of others.
er, ever mindful of the needs of others. Amen.
Amen.
well, I can only apologise.
the colonel's always looking for an excuse to criticise.
I hope you're not painting Griselda in a bathing suit?
miss Marple, that's disgusting.
thank you.--Certainly not.
but you must come to see it, Mr Clement.
it's at that very interesting stage.
like Dennis?--Oh, ha-ha.
pop over tomorrow, around teatime.--I will.
what is this, Mary? --Soup.
does it have a name?
bis and bobs and odds and sods and the meat raion's been cut again soup.
sorry. Sorry.
you're a bag of nerves this evening, Mr Hawes.
not just tonight. May I have a glass of water?
anyone else?-- No, thank you.
if it wasn't for my medicine, you see...
don't worry, you can't catch nerves.
it's a wretched affliction I bear with God's grace.
talking of wretched afflictions
Ronnie, Colonel Protheroe on Tuesday.
can you get the parish accounts into some sort of order?
I'll try.--I could strangle Protheroe sometimes.
may God forgive me.--I'd stab him.
I'd poison him.--I'd shoot him.
use my gun.--He's so rotten to Lettice.
Aw.--Just because he bought Old Hall, he thinks he's the local squire something.
you can't treat people like that now.
you're quite right. And how would you do it, Miss Marple?
I never speak lightly of murder, Mr Redding.
I hate to tempt fate.
surely not in this lovely place?
we're all very ordinary in St Mary Mead, but ordinary people sometimes do the most astonishing things
do you really have a pistol?--Somewhere. It's German.
I liberated it.--Were you wonderfully brave?
very well-trained, but scared to death.
I'll clear in five minutes.
fish and turnip stew-mostly turnip.
Oh, bring the apricot chutney, will you?
St Mary Mead vicarage.
no, Frankie, I can't.
but you'lI have your mum there.
who's the magistrate?
that'll be two-quid fine at least
how are we ever going to save up to get a...
I am very sorry but you have mistook a wrong number.
I forbid you to see him again!
he was only painting me.
I wish he were doing something else stupid the fuss you're making.
don't be common!--Well, don't be horrid, then.
you've driven the Dufosses to bed because your foul mood.
well, you blood can go too!--Gladly.
sit down. We haven't finished.--Good night, Lucius.
there are those who take a romantic view of poaching, Tarrant.
I do not.
this time, you'll go to prison.--Sir, you can't, sir!
all right, Mum.--Madam, sit down.
28 days.--I'll lose my job, you old bastard.
29.0
St Mary Mead vicarage.
it's not fair!
Mary?--I'm going out!
it's not just the difference in our ages, Jane.
the vicar and his wife are perfectly happy.
they'd be happier with a child, I think.
it would be their own.
Lettice was two when her mother died.
by the time I married Lucius, she was too old to think of me as anything other than the wicked stepmother.
I get on her nerves, and...
I'm afraid she gets on mine.
that makes him angry - even angrier than normal.
might you have a child of your own one day?
no.
That...side of things has dwindled rather.
completely.
I need tenderness, Jane.
and that's just not in his nature.
thank you.
sorry.
Oh, we all have to get things off our chest occasionally.
still... I married him for a kind of certainty.
we all wanted certainty after the war, didn't we?
I must settle for what I've got.
make do and mend?--Make do.
and at least there once was someone tender, but he didn't come back from the fighting.
Jane, I knew you'd come.
I had to.--Oh, my darling.
there's our lift
we'd better not keep him waiting.
bloody fool!
help me!
are you hurt?
no Oh!
Yes.--Caught her ankle.
Oh...
I'm so terribly sorry.
it wasn't your fault.
it has to support the sprain.
I have a stick in the car.
you might be able to hobble by tomorrow.
I don't want to be a hobbler, Dr Haydock.
shall I make some tea?
apparently, that won't be necessary.
it seems tea and scandal are coming to us.
I am lost. The small drawing room with the Flemish tapestry and the magnificent ceiling?
two down on the other side. That's my father's study.
heard me, then?--How could I not, Dennis?
want to go for a ride?--On that thing?
last year, we... --I was 16 and it was fun.
well, I haven't seen Lawrence Redding in a sports car.
he would if he had the money and he'd look so wonderfully...mature.
see you tomorrow for tennis?
Oh, yes, tennis with Dennis.
how did he get on?
a month inside. Protheroe.
mr Redding, you should shut this away.
probably.
here's one for you next time you're in the Blue Boar.
you sure you don't want me to start locking up when I go?
this is the heart of England, Mrs T.
besides, lock up the house and you lock out love.
Oh, my Lord! In her bathing suit?
the colonel won't have liked that from what I've seen.
looks like he's got a poker up his bum.
at least one.
will you be staying long in St Mary Mead, Mrs Lester?
Sylvia, please.
I shall have to see.--We're not too quiet for you?
like a millpond. But a change is as good as a rest.
a change...from what...exactly?
my helter-skelter life, Miss Hartnell.
if you'll excuse me, I must...
I must see how Griselda's portrait is coming along.
I do hope you like it, darling.
Goodbye.--Bye.
good afternoon, Vicar.--Goodbye.
and what are you wearing for Mr Redding?
just my dignity, Mrs Price-Ridley, and a pink feather boa.
really, Griselda!
I think I'll just refresh the pot.
now, who'd like a stiffener in their Darjeeling?
Oh, I...
Vicar...--No...
I'd forgotten you were coming.
is he doing Mrs Protheroe too?
quite a busy boy with his brush.
she offered to come to London, but...
well, I came here to get away from it and...
well, Anne wouldn't be suited to the the madness of my life there.
and I wouldn't want her to be. I'm tired of it.
I'm tired of being wild.
you're quite wild enough for us.
I just feel that I've let you all down.
I've been happier in St Mary Mead than I've ever been in my life.
even my work's better, I think.
that's certainly less wild.--But you must end it.
I can't.--Then you should consider leaving.
think of her reputation.
you are the only one who knows.
yet. You only have to sneeze in this village for someone to
miss Bourne's here about next week's flowers.
Oh, she's late. That's not like her.
please, please think about what I've said.
old Hall. Good evening.
Yes, he is. Who shall I say?
I'll have to give a name, madam.
residents ONLY
what do you want, Sylvia?
to tell you something, and see that stiff upper lip wobble as if you were facing a firing squad.
last cigarette?
blindfold?
bang.
I'll manage the stairs by tomorrow.--Dressing gown?
Yes, please.
how was the portrait?
a brief viewing?
you saw.--I'm afraid we all did.
Griselda was horrified when I told her.
if Protheroe finds out...
now, I know he's a brute, but Anne married him, and I believe in the sanctity of marriage.
I'm so lucky.
she could have had anyone.
she chose you.
it's been the best three years of my life.
here we are.
hairbrush, mirror and book.
is it a good read?
betcha life it is, padre.
anything else from the dressing table?
no.
beautiful.
a perfect example for this period.
indeed. When are you going to publish?
autumn is the next edition of our journal.
Ah. It will be all English country houses.
I will send you a copy from Paris. I'll make a note of it.
how is France now?
France? And, well, what do you say?
we are getting on our feet.
how was your war?
bad things happened.
and yours, Colonel?
unfortunately, I, er...
I am not at liberty to discuss my service.
Lucius...--Hmm? Ah. Good day to you.
I'll be back on the 5: 30.
I have a meeting with Mrs Ross-Harkins after court.
don't forget the vicarage at a quarter past six.
aren't there any sales in Melchester?
london is London.
well, don't buy too much.
there won't be too much!
Dennis is taking me.--What?
only to the station.--Oh.
Bye.--Bye.
Oh, look at this scratch!--Well, what about my wheel?
you weren't looking, you fool!
mind on other things, I dare say, like those accounts.
what do you mean?--Well, we'll see what I mean.
just make sure the vicar has them for six fifteen.
it does have brakes, you know, this car
good God, woman!
thank you.
Ah, Mrs Clement.--Colonel.
Melchester?
London.
I trust your garden shed will shortly be restored to its proper purpose.
it has never had an improper purpose.
clearly our standards are different.
clearly, I'm glad to say.
I beg your pardon?
why are you so dreadful to Len?
he's a good, honest man who tries to set an example of Christian charity.
perhaps charity can begin too close to home.
return to Melchester, please.
mr Redding ran after the vicar and Mrs Protheroe had her shoes off and I'm sure you could see her petticoat.
when I went to pay my paper bill this morning,
florrie Ranby said she wasn't at all surprised, and, of course, Miss Marple knew it was someone older.
the colonel read a most apt lesson on Sunday had he but known it:
when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin.
I have to put this right.
my parents want me to go to Kenya help them manage the farm.
you could try for university.
I would if I had something else to stay for.
Dennis... Apart from anything...
well, you know Daddy, money or prospects.--Nought out of two.
you mean, if it wasn't for him...?--No.
well, who knows?
can't we just be friends?
you can forget about Lawrence.
uncle Len walked in on him and your stepmother and he wasn't painting her.
shall I be mother?--Thank you.
I do love her, you know. It's not just about...
sex?
I keep thinking about whavicar said about people knowing, and I got a very strange look in the newsagent's from Mrs Whale.
well, she's got wind of things.
the only reason Mr Goldworthy knew about his wife and the Gl was when he heard Mrs Whale mention the nylon stockings and the chewing gum.
I'll have to leave, for Anne's sake.
that's very brave.
Yes, well, I'll soon be over it.
you won't.
not for a long while.
nothing gets past you, Miss Marple, does it?
hardly ever, young man.
I'll tell the vicar now.
he won't be back from his calls yet.--Nor will he.
there is something I could do for you, Miss Marple.
if you'd like.
mr Redding in the study.
it's the right decision.
have you told her?
I need to find the words.--You will.
well, you're very trusting.
I'm not that sure of myhelf.
I'll clear out the shed.
thank you for letting me set up in there.
that was Griselda.--I never did finish her painting.
you're a very lucky man.
look after her for me, won't you?
Anne, I mean.
et maintenant... Maintenant qu'est-ce qu'on fait?
sois patient. Je dois penser.
Ah, Mary. Erm, old Mr Abbott over at Lower Farm, his neighbour's telephoned to say he's poorly again, so I won't be back by 6: 15.
apologise to Colonel Protheroe and ask him to wait for me.
I'll be as nice as I can.
I can still see it now, his first day in the village.
it was one of those moments when you know that nothing will ever be the same again.
he reminded me of what might have been in the days when I still hoped for happiness.
there can be happiness in acceptance, you know, of what can't change.
can there?
thank you, Jane.
what for?
for not judging me.
he'll be late.--Oh, it's all right.
I'll wait.--You'll have to, won't you?
Oh, thank you.
there's a sweet little crested wren that likes this side of the woods.
did Lawrence mention the future at all?
I'll go, I'll go.
St Mary Mead 235.
it was for me.
for you?--I'm...wanted at the vicarage.
sorry.
bonsoir, Monsieur le Professeur.
Ah, bonsoir, madame.
a beautiful evening for walking, no?
if only I could.
Oh.
goodbye, Mr Redding.
bonsoir, madame.
Oh, une petite promenade, c'est tout.
if you're going back now, may I join you?--Yes.
thank you.
a large one. I've had a hell of a day.
good evening, Mary.
wait in the study with the colonel.--He's here?
he is.
show me your ways, O Lord, teach me your paths.
guide me in your truth and teach me.
show me your ways, O Lord, teach me your paths.
guide me in your truth and teach me. What must I do?
what must I do?
did you want to see me again?
mr Redding?
how's Mr Abbott?--Convalescing in Bournemouth.
someone's idea of a joke.
no, no. No.
detective Inspector Slack.
Leonard Clement. I'm the vicar.
the collar's a clue. Is the doctor here?
Yes.
Len, what's going on?
haIf an hour, at a guess.
certainly no more than 30 minutes before my examination.
which was when?
well, the vicar found him at just gone quarter to seven.
I'm only down the road... Say I got here at ten to.
almost spot on.
time of death about 6: 20, then.
better than almost.
give the man a coconut.
dear Vicar,
I'm afraid I cannot wait for you any longer, but must...
that's it.--Pistol?
Yes.
are these always open?
usually, in this weather.
so, the vicar's called away with a bogus message, murderer comes in through the garden.
victim writing a note with back turned.
that's how and when.
just why and who?
the lady in the cottage with a view of the back here...
miss Marple? I need to interview her.
would you tag along? These old maids tend to get nervous.
if you're not quite sure of something
I'll wait until you have a little think.
did you see anyone enter the vicarage around 20 past six?
Yes. Mrs Protheroe.
is that when you think he was killed?
it looks like it.
how's your hearing?
it's excellent.
so you would have heard a gun fired from the vicarage?
it's hard to say. I did hear a shot about 6: 30 in the woods, I thought, which is not unusual, but...
whether one could tell the difference...
what about this artist, Mr Redding?
well, he looked terribly shocked.
I assumed he'd discovered the body.
of course, he and the colonel...
he'd been painting Lettice - in a bathing suit.
Oh, avant-garde. Is that the term?
I don't believe it.
what? At the vicarage?
Yes, ma'am.--Anne?
Lucius is dead.
is it really true, Mr Hawes?
I heard it at the station.--Yes.
I'm on my way to the vicarage.
was there much blood?--How would I know that?
no.
do you think it was a crime of passion?
after all, Mrs Protheroe and Mr Redding...
fornication always has consequences, but I don't think we should jump to conclusions.
the colonel was not much liked by anyone, was he?
no. I'm afraid not.
of course, his appointment with the vicar was hardly a secret.
are there any secrets in St Mary Mead?
lots. Yet. I hope.
I want to talk to someone.
when was this?--Didn't Mary hear anything?
her wireless was turned up full blast as usual.
no. Wait till I get there.
she did hear the colonel sneeze very loudly.
who's speaking to him? I'll be right there.
that's how, when and who.
now for why
lawrence Redding just walked into the station and confessed, and he's brought the murder weapon.
good night.
old Hall.
it is terrible.
we will leave on the afternoon train, of course.
has the police an idea of who could do this thing?
I have.
it's the police, madam.
excuse me.
no, Inspector, he can't. He... I can't...
why does Inspector Slack think the coloneI was shot at 20 past six?
he'd started writing a note to vicar saying he couldn't wait
he'd put the time on it.--Had he?
and the clock stopped at just gone 6: 20.
he knocked it off the desk when he took the bullet.
Oh, dear.
I'm afraid I must put a cat amongst the inspector's pigeons.
he was going on and on about his daughter, which was just her silly little crush, so I told him it was his wife he had to worry about, just to shut him up.
then he really started.
I thought about what I was leaving her to...
and I shot him.
the Chief Constable sends his regards.
isn't that lovely?
I have been of some assistance to him from time to time.
he said.
it's the clock.
I happen to know Mrs Clement put it a quarter of an hour fast on Sunday to improve the vicar's punctuality.
well, wonderful. Did it work?
Yes.--I'm glad to hear it.
so, either it was really five past six when it stopped, before the colonel even arrived for his appointment, or the murderer moved the hands back to match the time on the note.
it still fits - the artistic touch.
but Mr Redding was in the lane at 20 past six.
I saw him.--You may well have done, Miss Marple, but he killed the colonel at 6. 45. Mary let him in.
the vicar saw him leave.--6: 45?
but I only examined at ten to.
and told me that he'd died within the last 30 minutes.--At the most, I said.
6: 20 or a little before, yes.
6: 30...6. 40 at a pinch, but if Redding says he shot him at 6: 45, he's lying.
and doctors are never wrong?
I've got a confession.
if the bullet killing the colonel doesn't match Redding's gun, I'll eat my handcuffs.
sometimes, the simple explanation is the right one.
last night's wasn't.
I'll have someone see you out.
if he was shot at a quarter to seven, why had he stopped in the middle of a sentence at 20 past six?
Anne...--I have to telephone the police.
I'd like someone with me.
I killed him.--What time?
miss Marple saw me going at about 20 past six.
I just...
I just hated him so much, I shot him.
with?
his old service revolver
he always kept it loaded and I took it.
Anne, you didn't have a gun.--It was in my bag.
you didn't have a bag.
there was nowhere else it could have been, not in that dress
St Mary Mead 23...
Yes, speaking.
is that definite?
right.
I don't like my time wasted, Mrs Protheroe.
the bullet that killed your husband was fired from Mr Redding's gun.
but he did it for me.--He didn't do it for anyone.
I released him half an hour ago.
he just happened to be carrying his gun which I don't believe.
and more important, and something that you didn't think of, if the coloneI was shot at a quarter to seven, why did he stop the note like that at 6: 20?
Oh, yes.--Hm-hm.
er...
but if it was his gun... --We'll find out.
he thinks I'm arresting you for murder.
Anne!--Lawrence!
sealed with a loving kiss?
it's to my Frank.
is he allowed to receive letters when he's not breaking rocks?
he ain't doing hard labour.
who would have thought it, though? Mr Redding.
such a nice young man.
nice enough to keep a gun in the house?
I blame that Mrs Protheroe. The way she swans around.
you'd think she was in a magazine, the look of her.
she put Mr Redding up to it, if you ask me.
excuse me.
my football pools.
you never know. I only just missed out on ￡1, 000 last week.
money is the root of all evil.
I'd give it space in my garden.
Bye.
Oh, I'd better... I don't want to speak out of turn, especially if it wasn't anything.
the police have released Lawrence.
mr Redding. --Have they? Then, I wonder...
this must be so unsettling for you.
I can't bear it.
I was on my way to the church, Mrs Clement.
shall we pray together?
Erm...I-I need to find Mr Charlesworth before he closes for lunch.
I need some of those...
Oh, whatever you call them! Good and sharp.
Mrs Protheroe was only out of sight for 30 seconds at most then she went into the shed.
mr Redding joined her from the lane.
he told me He was saying goodbye to her, leaving the village
she must have been terribly upset.
they stayed there for ten minutes or so.
the church clock struck a half hour.
they came out again, meeting Monsieur Dufosse, who appeared from the footpath to Old Hall.
then his granddaughter arrived.
Dufosse?--Mm. Guests of the Protheroes.
you don't keep it shut away?
Yes, yes, I know, I know I should.
Mrs Tarrant who mucks me out is always telling me off about that, and I never lock up during the day.
did you recognise...
when was the last time you saw the gun before it turned up in the study?
Erm...the day before yesterday.
did you recognise the voice...
wouldn't you prefer to rest your ankle, Miss Marple?
no, thank you. Did you recognise the voice on the telephone?
no. It just said to come straight over to the vicarage if I didn't want Lucius to find out about us.
a man or woman?--A woman. I think.
it did sound quite faint as if someone was holding the receiver away from them.
so it could have been a man.--Well spotted, Vicar.
who knew you we re at Miss Marple's?-- No one.
someone must have seen me arrive.
Er...watching me.
my husband's dead. I...
so, you came through the garden, and up to the French windows and then what happened?
Yes, they were open, but I didn't hear any voices.
I looked in and no-one was here, so I went up to the shed to see if I could find Lawrence.
no-one here? That's impossible.
did you come right in?
no. I just...popped my head in.
Ah. It's the biggest aspidistra in the world.
if the coloneI was here at the desk you wouldn't have seen him alive or dead.
sit down.
a drink at the Blue Boar then you returned to see the vicar again about your situation, and then what?
the authorised version this time.
I came in. He was dead. I saw my gun.
I thought that Anne had finally had enough so I picked it up and I left.--And you confessed to protect her.
and you returned the favour because you thought he'd done it.
very love's young dream.
I bet you two are down the Odeon every Friday.
tell your guests I need to speak to them.
don't think about leaving this village until I say so. Go.
erm... Sorry.
excuse me.
you don't like Mr Clement, do you?
nothing personal.
vicars in general...remind me of marriage.
Ah...of course.--Of course what?
miss Hartnell's cousin's maid is just walking out with a butcher's boy from Melchester who delivers to your mother-in-Law.
Mrs Slack has been staying with her for a...
little holiday, I gather.
a little two-month six-day holiday, so far.
Oh, dear. --Hm.
of course
I've only got Mr Clement's word about the bogus call.
surely you don't suspect him?
Erm...--May I?
please.
0.263888888889
I'm afraid I cannot wait for you any longer.
the colonel was...not the most patient of men, but the vicar would only have been five minutes late at 20 past six.
Mary had warned him he wouldn't be on time when she showed him in.
hm. 6: 20.
the ink is...don't you think, blue-black, rather than blue?
Yes, and the writing's smaller.--Mm.
thank you, Miss Marple.
that means he could have been shot after 6: 20, and then the murderer put that onto the note and then altered the clock...
to the time when Mrs Protheroe came here in answer to her anonymous telephone call.
and Mr Redding's gun as the murder weapon.
I think they were being...er...
set up as pasties.
Patsies...it is.
Mm.
thank you, Inspector.
sorry. Sorry, I'll come back. I was looking for some...
you're exactly where he was killed, aren't you?
how horrible. Do you know who did it?
not yet, no.
'Vengeance is mine,I will repay " ,said the Lord.
well, someone beat the Lord to it.
I need some water. For my medicine.
but supposing he was killed at 6: 30?
that would tie in with the shot that you heard.
if it was from here.
you're sure the only person you saw come in was Mrs Protheroe at 6: 20?
through the garden, certainly but I can't see the French windows from my cottage.
and the woods come right up on this side.
it would be a scramble, but if one was determined or if one came in through the hall.
the colonel was deaf, so they could creep up behind him.
the hall? No, no cos Mary would have let them in the front door.
hasn't she told you it's often left open?
Mary!
is this wise?
you're not exactly green-fingered.
Oh, don't fuss, darling! Trust me.
pass those scissory things, would you?
Len?
sorry.
thank you. Ooh!
watch YOUR WIFE CHAPTER 7 VERSE 2
Oh!--Sorry to startle you, Lettice.
you have my deepest sympathy.--Oh. Yes.
m m. Do you know you've got some paint on you?
that's been there ages. I must have it cleaned.
you haven't seen a yellow beret?
No.--I'm sure I left it in here last week when I came to see Dennis.--I'm sorry.
you? Gardening?
well, I have to do something.
what did you bring back yesterday?--Hm?
from London.--Oh, yes, London.
I couldn't find a thing I wanted.--Not like you.
Bye.--Bye.
I had a man-to-man word with the photographer.
he said he'd send me--Shh! Let me just look at you.
he'll start clearing it out tomorrow. --It's a shame.
he was on his way to getting me. Don't you think?
was he?
Oh, you silly man!
Yes, he's charming, yes, he's like a breath of fresh air in the village, yes, I was flattered, but...
no.
you are my husband, Len.
I would never deceive you.
unless it was for the best.
there was a single bullet wound to the back of the head, which I concluded was the cause of death.
did you fomarlly estimate the time of death, Dr Haydock?
between 6: 20 or thereabouts and 6. 40 at the latest.
thank you
I showed him in at 6: 15 and then went back to the kitchen.
he wasn't half looking pleased with himself though, like the cat that got the cream.
then I heard him give a blooming great sneeze about five minutes after, and the next time I see him, he was dead. --Very well, Miss Hill. Step down.
did you know the colonel sent her young man to prison?
Frank Tarrant.
lastly, Mrs Protheroe, can you think of anyone who might have wished your husband harm?
no. No-one at all, I'm afraid.
thank you.--Although...
Yes?--On Monday in Melchester High Street, he was nearly hit by a motorcycle.
are you suggesting this was deliberate?
it didn't seem so at the time.
I just thought I should mention it.
I find that the deceased Colonel Lucius Alexander Protheroe was murdered by a person or persons unknown.
did you wonder about the motorbike?
it was just going too fast, I thought.
he did come very close, though.
he or she. One couldn't tell.
by the way, when the colonel stayed late in Melchester on Tuesday afternoon, what was he doing?--Meeting Mrs Ross-Harkins, I think.
Hermione? The bishop's wife, and his fellow magistrate too.
inspector, please find out who did this.
if someone tried to make it look as if...
well, they must hate Lawrence and me very much, and er...
well, I'm scared.
wait.
Oh.
this was outside the French windows.
no one at the vicarage smokes.
Dennis sneaking a crafty one?--Sniff.
French. Young men on leave a long time ago they'd bring them back from France.
when Monsieur Dufosse appeared on the footpath,
I wonder if he'd only just turned into it from the woods.
look, it's easy to imagine all kinds of things after the event, but the simple fact is...--Murder is never simple.
we would be foolish, stupid, to ignore any possibility.
we?
did I say that?
so sorry.
I don't know whether to buy her a box of chocs or kick away her stick.
I'd prefer the chocolates.
how marvellous that you're not in black. It's so dreary.
should I know you?--I want you to.
who are you?--Ah."Who is Sylvia?
what is she?
let's have a little chat.
I made a walk along the footpath.
it is very beautiful.
did you go into the woods, Mr Dufosse?
no. Footpath only.
when do you go back to France?
we have missed the good connection now.
tomorrow by the first train.
I might need to get in touch with you.
what's this magazine of yours called?
you'll have to spell it.
and the bishop and his wife get back tomorrow?
would you please be kind to ask Hermione to telephone me as soon as they get back to Melchester?
Jane Marple.
it might, yes.
very important indeed.
Anne gets the hall.
but you can set up on your own.
I'll help you look for somewhere.
he's only been dead two days.--So? You hated him.
the killer did you a favour.-- Dennis!
it's true.--I'm going in.
why did you tell Miss Marple you lost your beret?
you had it at tennis.--Were you listening?
and you left before we finished the game.
and you went soon after. The gardener told me.
Yes. But you don't think I could have killed your father.
you don't think I care enough about you.
I know who did it.--There you are.
two birds, one stone.
perhaps you could tell me where you both were on Tuesday evening.
together. We played tennis.
then we went for a walk. In the woods.
Yes, the woods, rolling around over towards Much Benham. It was a smashing evening.
wasn't it?
Hello, Tony? It's Joan Hargreaves.
I need a favour. Is your place anywhere near St Mary Mead?
I left the ledgers on the desk so you'd have them to hand when the colonel arrived.
you don't think the...murderer took them?
no. I expect Mary's been moving things.
were they all in order, by the way?
Mrs Price-Ridley's pound note was counted in with the jumble sale money.
I went back over the last six months and everything balances.
as we knew it would.
lust bringeth forth sin and sin bringeth forth death.
I...I can't stay in here.
I don't know what to do.
suddenly, we just seem so...distant.
what would you like to do?
Oh...
walk away, just the two of us into a crisp and snowy morning.
then paint it.
the sneeze that Mary heard that could have been the murderer, couldn't it?
and Anne was there.
I just hope she's safe.
he is early, your friend. Good.
Bonjour.
the magazine you work for went out of business before war.
now, what have you got? the silver?
my grandson, Henri.
he would have been my husband.
we met in 1943.
he was in the Resistance.--And you, Miss Hargreaves?
special Operations.
I was dropped into France, working with Henri and his crew.
the colonel?--He commanded a desk in London.
ll a trahi Henri.
he betrayed him.-- He betrayed my grandson.
Protheroe's section was responsible for supplying the whole of our region, weapons, detonators and so on.
early in 1944, he had to organise a money drop tens of thousands of francs in cash.
Henri and I waited at the rendezvous he'd given us, but the plane went over and dropped the canister a mile away.
Why?--The rendezvous was false.
the money was picked up by a man called Lacombe, one of our group, who had known Protheroe before the war.
it was simple greed.
after the war, they divided it between them.
LaCombe and the colonel.
LaCombe made a confession to me, last year when he was dying
that's the proof: bank transfers, statements
LaCombe's instructions.
what happened to Henri?
LaCombe had tipped off the Germans and they came for us.
I escaped.
he did not. --He was tortured...until death.
my grandson.
I'm very sorry.--And so am I.
so am I. I'll tell you the truth.
I had to kill that son of a bitch, the colonel!
because of him. And so,
I got my pistol, I went to the woods, up to the vicarage, through the French windows and into the study.
Ah...--Yes, Mr Dufosse?
I was too late.
I was too damn late!
he was dead.
are you saying...?--I'm saying...
he was already dead.
thankfully.
you're quite good at this.
I've had to learn.--Oh
so, if what he told you is true, the colonel was dead by 6: 30
when Monsieur Dufosse joined the others.
only just, if the shot you heard was the murder.
do you believe him?--Yes.
but the interesting thing is what Monsieur Dufosse saw in the study.
he described the gun as having a long barrel, you know, like the old Wild West ones?
and he thought the note was a good half page long, not just a couple of lines.
that is interesting.
I don't know how reliable he is, though.
he had just come in out of bright sunlight...
and he is getting on.
you've missed a bit.
the note...
have you shown it to Mrs Protheroe?
no, actually.
she's at the vicarage now, I believe.
funeral arrangements.
neither is in his writing, not the time or the words.
I don't understand.
you're not alone at this stage of the investigation.
do you have any examples of the colonel's handwriting?
Yes, of course.
I found it yesterday under the desk.
it's not Griselda's.
it's Anne's.
should I give it to the Inspector?--No.
not just yet.
sir, can I have a word?
how very unpleasant.
the verse?
to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife and let every woman have her own husband.
the motorbike was stolen in the morning and dumped soon after the incident.
such a...crude and uncertain way of killing someone,
unless it was just meant to frighten him.--I, er...
I must get on with my visiting.
I can...see myself out.
we'll get back to Mrs Protheroe.
Hello, Miss Marple.
I was thinking about leaving this one.
I might come back and finish it one day.
when do you go?
I don't know. Tomorrow or the next day.
as soon as I can clean out the cottage.
back to London?
I was thinking about Ireland.
put some real distance between us.
you'll find a new life in time.
but Anne won't, will she?--I'll do my best for her.
she's a good friend.
thank you. Thank you for everything.
you've been crying?
pot and kettle, dear.
I have some things to discuss.
not very clever to use your scented notepaper.
where are people's standards? That's what worries me.
this young man Mrs Clement was seen with in Melchester...
miss Hartnell said he was rather handsome and he gave her flowers.
I'm sure there's an innocent explanation, but even so, really, Marjorie...
I'm so ashamed, Jane.
what would Bruce think of me? And Andrew?
that you sometimes get very lonely.
Yes.--And Anne Protheroe's standards...
of course, you weren't to know the colonel had been murdered when you telephoned her at my cottage, but even so, it put her in a difficult position when she went over there.
that wasn't me!
when's the funeral?--Tuesday afternoon.
Ah. I'm in London all morning.
I hope the trains are better than last Tuesday.
I had to cadge a lift back.--The day of the murder?
chaos. Not a single train to St Mary Mead the whole afternoon.
every time we tell a lie...
we are offending God.
the heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked.
who can know it?
well, God can.
he sees into our hearts and searches them, to give every man according to his ways and according to the fruit of his doings.
let us, then, keep our hearts pure so we may say with Paul, "I have lived in all good conscience before God.
Oh, bad luck.--It wasn't luck.
someone stabbed my tyre.
such a violent thing to do.
with everything that's been going on, I'm...
I'm terrified, Mr Redding.
well, I'll walk you to your digs if you'd like.
Oh, yes, please. Would you?--Bless you.
thank you.
yes?
I want to live in all good conscience.
may I introduce you to my mother?
I know. I know I'm not a good advertisement for motherhood.
I don't want an advertisement.
why did the colonel divorce you, may I ask?
I had a...tiny, tiny fling.
I like parties and people, but Lucius wanted to clip my wings.
he offered me an allowance in return...
in return for never seeing me again.
until now.It's taken me six years since my second husband died to get my courage up.
dutch courage, mostly.
I'm not very proud of myself.
you're here now, Mother.
I thought you were dead.
never mind the hearts and flowers.
look, when Protheroe came to your room...
we have a witness. Were you trying to blackmail him?
Lord, no! I'm very well set up.
no. I just told him I wanted to see lovely daughter Lettice.
she's going to reform me.
you're all I've got.--She sees me in a cottage, baking jam and knitting...things.
as long as we can have an occasional cruise, dear.
Lettice...
may I have a private word?
it's Anne's.--It was under the desk where your father was murdered.
I knew it was her. Tell the police.
did you put it there when you were pretending to look for your beret?
she wasn't wearing those earrings on the day of the murder.
wasn't she?--Oh, Lettice, it's me.
all right, but I don't see what difference it makes, Miss Marple.
she killed him somehow so she could get her hands on Lawrence.
Lettice...--What?
the red paint on your dress was new, wasn't it?
you'd just been in the shed.
so? I heard you all coming and I had to hide.
I must have brushed against something.
it was magenta, anyway.
the colour of passion, Lawrence says.
you know, Hermione, I'll have to tell the police.
thank you, dear.
when the colonel kept his appointment at the vicarage, he had just learnt that Mr Hawes left his last parish under a cloud.
the bishop kept it from the vicar to give him another chance
what had he done?--Fiddled the accounts.
Ronnie's tried to kill himself.
dr Haydock's there and he's found a statement from Colonel Protheroe accusing him...
accusing him of stealing?--Yes.
I owe you a box of chocs.
nothing gets past you, Miss Marple, does it?
hardly ever.
nothing gets past you, Miss Marple, does it?
hardly ever, young man.
how clever!
how wicked!
the gas was full on, and that much sedative would have put him to sleep quickly.
another few minutes and he would have cheated the hangman.
note of conversation today regarding Ronald Hawes curate of St Mary Mead.
previous embezzlement of funds...It's all here.
Monsieur Dufosse said the note he saw was longer.
the accounts. He told me he'd left them in the study.
lawrence Redding can tell us his state of mind.
the landlady said he came in with him and stayed talking.
running well now, isn't she?--Ooh.
I've got it, Inspector.
Lettice was right.
Anne Protheroe did kill her husband.
Anne and Lawrence Redding.
they made themselves the obvious suspects by ensuring their secret was out, knowing that if their plan worked
they would later appear above suspicion
Oh!--I forgot you were coming.
which, of course, he had not, and Anne Protheroe chose the Toby Jug just for a change
mr Redding wasn't trying to run the colonel down
he knew it would help them muddy the waters when Anne mentioned it at the inquest.
bloody fool!--Oh!
they were making sure I'd be a captive audience for their little charade in a ringside seat
he must have had his gun with him then and a silencer
Monsieur Dufosse, remember, spoke of a long barrel.
mr Redding in the study.
it's the right decision.
have you told her?--I need to find the words.
then, he made two telephone calls, the first to get the vicar out of the way by pretending to be Mr Abbot's neighbour
Mary, old Mr Abbot at Lower Farm his neighbour's telephoned to say he's very poorly again.
the second to my cottage.
St Mary Mead 235.
we're all set, darling.
it was for me. Sorry.
she knew I'd see she couldn't possibly have a gun with her when she went into the vicarage at 20 past six
which was when you shot your husband.
coffee and cake, you said, when you telephoned.
Where's Lawrence.
under arrest by now.
the loud sneeze that Mary heard at 6: 20
was your silenced pistol
mr Redding, fired by Mrs Protheroe.
the shot at 6: 30 had me puzzled, until Miss Marple found what she did.
it didn't come from the woods or from the house
it came from the shed.
so she goes off with the Dufosses and you go to the Blue Boar
a large one. I've had a hell of a day.
then you return to the vicarage on the pretext of seeing Mr Clement again knowing he wouldn't be back from his wild-goose chase.
wait in the study with the colonel.
he's here?--He is.
you remove the murder weapon and leave a forged note with deliberate mistakes.
different handwriting in different inks on vicarage notepaper you'd taken previously.
a shock to find a statement from the colonel but it might come in useful
you reset the clock knowing it was fast all to make us think Mrs Protheroe was being falsely implicated in her husband's murder
and the colonel's statement did come in useful last night, didn't it?
as you now had evidence of a motive, enough to frame Mr Hawes for the murder.
Oh, bad luck.
calm down, Ronnie. I'll mix your medicine...
and turn on the gas as you drift away and leave the colonel's note by the body.
but murder, Anne?
for a stranger who reminded you of what might have been?
he wasn't a stranger.
but I was right when I said that nothing was ever the same again
it was Lawrence who didn't come back from the fighting...
except that he did four years after he'd been reported dead, and by then, I was Mrs Protheroe.
he found you?
he was too decent to try when he heard I'd married.
I found him.
a magazine article about the rising young artist back from the dead.
what did we do wrong?
you ask me that?
what mistake did we make?
when you came out of the shed with him you were the same woman.
you hadn't said goodbye forever to the man you loved.
you could tell that?--You think I've never...
I lost someone in the war...
who got a medal for dying.
his wife will have cherished it.
his wife?
easier for you, then, Jane.
he was dead.
you didn't have to choose between right and wrong.
when you volunteered, darling you made a choice to do your duty.
Yes.--I've had to make a choice too.
I've chosen to do my duty.
come back safe, but for your wife, not for me.
Jane...
please, if I can't come back for you, then there's...
Jane!
Jane!
Lawrence! Lawrence!
it's the apricot chutney with fish stew that gave me inkling
when did you find out?
my cousin called this morning to confirm it.
of course!
he's that doctor in Melchester, isn't he?
rather a handsome young man.
I didn't want to see Dr Haydock.
well, you know village gossip.
and I wanted to be sure first.
she told me she'd gone to London.
I never suspected a thing.
our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.
thy kingdom come.
thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
give us this day our daily bread. forgive us our trespasses.
as we forgive those who trespass against us.
and lead us not into temptation.
but deliver us from evil.
is there time?
just.
a letter from Edmund.
he's met a girl and married her in London.
we've tied the knot now without any fuss, just in case.
her name is Martine. She's French.
I'll bring her down to meet you all before I sail.
if I'm asleep when they come tell them from us it's only love that matters.
Love...not money.
however much you may have, actually.
have I said goodbye to the others?
my precious children.
Emma,
Alfred,
Harold,
Edith,
Cedric.
I love them all so much.
she's gone.
Oh, Dad.
ten YEARS LATER
tickets! Tickets!
a single to St Mary Mead, if you please.
first class.
thank you.
Jane!
fetch out the damson gin!
I'm catching the 4.50 from Paddington.
St. MARY MEAD
all aboard!
Oh, Roddy.
don't...
last service for tea, madam.
Roddy.
no, don't.
I've just seen a murder.
4. 50 FROM PADDINGTON
there's nothing in the headlines.
have a look in the Stop Press.
they must have found the poor woman's body by now.
when i changed trains that attendant said he was going to report it immediately.
and you told him you'd be staying here?
Yes, I gave him your telephone number for the police.
he did believe you? Why the devil shouldn't he?
Oh! I'm not so sure.
the awful thing is I'm beginning to doubt it myself.
last week I put sugar on my kippers.
you don't think I'm going doolally?
anyone less doolally than you, Elspeth, I have yet to meet.
should I still go tomorrow? Roddy will be so disappointed.
it's his first Christmas without Margaret.
and only your second without Arthur.
if I can be of some comfort to the poor, sweet man
then you must do your duty.
is it very hot in Ceylon?
and sticky.
I've taken plenty of light frocks.
I'm rather worried about perspiring, Jane.
I'll just have to change frequently.
you're a lady, Elspeth! You won't perspire. You'll glow.
now, if we get our skates on we should just catch the 10. 33.
where to? I've had enough of trains.
british TRANSPORT COMMISSION RAILWAY POLICE
I now apologise that no-one thought to relay the astonishing news to you sooner.
astonishing? Yeah.
I'm surprised we didn't get the headlines.
amazing discovery. No Corpse On Train.
I told you they wouldn't believe me.
now, be fair, Mrs. McGillicuddy.
the attendant did call the local police. They called us.
I interrupted major pickpocket surveillance to help identify the offending train, which was then held at the next stop with considerable disruption to the timetable.
a full search was carried out.
there was no body.
and the passengers? Did you look in their luggage?
Why? You read about Bodies in Suitcases, don't you?
I know what must have happened.
the murderer pushed the body out of the train.
have you any idea how hard it is to open a train door at speed, let alone shove a body out?
in any case on the off-chance that Charles Atlas is the murderer, all the drivers and the guards on that line have been asked to keep an eye open for a body by the track
so far, the phones have remained silent.
now, I have work to do
which train was it, may I ask, and where was it searched?
police information is confidential, dear.
if I was 20 years younger, I would put you across my knee and tan your hide, you snotty pup.
and it's railway information not police information when you think of it, and we all own the railways now, don't we?
I've got the timetable.
still no sign. Oh, dear.
did they have a map? They did.
that's us.
the very same train.
do you suppose the murderer's on it?
I doubt he makes a habit of strangling women on trains.
no. It was the last carriage?
third class.
how soon after the murder did you reach Hampton Parva and change for St Mary Mead?
the attendant said it was seven minutes to the next station and that was two minutes at the most after I'd told him what I'd seen.
lf we assume that the murder happened 9 minutes before and you arrived at the station at 5.35.
that train inspector said this train was searched at Brackhampton, which would have been at 5.40.
here's where we are now
the tracks run side by side.
we must be almost there.
would you mind strangling me, Elspeth?
not at all, Jane.
please don't mind us.
it's a bit rocky.
we're slowing down.
that's why the blind flew up when it did.
where exactly are we?
right slap-bang in the middle of nowhere, by the look of it.
this is where you must have seen the other train.
Yes, so it is, Jane.
come on, Stoddard-West! Catch up!
wait, wait, Eastley!
Alexander! James!
what did I tell you?
you are never, never to come this far without my permission
sorry, Daddy. Sorry, Mr. Eastley.
it was my fault.
what would your mother say if you'd fallen in?
come on. It's time to eat.
we slowed down around this curve.
the railway follows the boundary of a very large estate just before Brackhampton.
the house is Rutherford Hall.
Rutherford Hall. That clangs a damn great bell.
I just can't...
Oh, maybe I am going doolally.
no, no, no, it'll come to you.
I only had a glimpse but we were looking down.
the line runs along an embankment.
if that's where he pushed the body out, it would have rolled into the grounds.
no wonder no-one's seen it by the track.
he was a lucky brute.
if it was luck.
it's the only place a train would be going slowly enough to manage it.
it's just possible he chose the spot very carefully indeed.
but why has no-one at Rutherford Hall found her?
it could be unoccupied.
so many of our big houses are being sold off.
no, it is occupied, Jane. I've just remembered.
look
Rutherford Hall. Cook-housekeeper for Christmas holidays.
thank you again for my present.
and for yours.
I'd hate to run out of talcum powder in that climate.
Oh, dear.
it's the first time Mr. Linch has been to the airport.
it's the first time I've been to Ceylon.
I hope the pilot knows the way.
now, promise me you won't do anything foolhardy.
I promise. Not on my own.
# I travel alone #
# Fair though the places and faces I've known #
# When the dream is ended and passion has flown #
# I travel alone #
# Free from love's illusion, my heart is my own #
# I travel alone #
quite, quite enchanting, Lucy.
thank you, Mr. Coward. I'll lay the table.
not so fast.
a few words of heartfelt appreciation on your last day.
miss. Eyelesbarrow breezed in like a whirling dervish a fortnight ago to rescue me.
standing in, not only for my secretary, but also for my housekeeper.
clearly, I overpay them both.
in August, she was in Turkey, looking after a sultan.
did you know that a sultan's wife is called a sultana?
every time I bite into a slice of fruitcake, I wonder if...
I'm so sorry. Miss. Marple?
Lucy! Sorry.
whoever she is, dear, speak to her about timing.
this one's for you, Dickie.
is that Lord Mountbatten? Yes.
Raymond said you wouldn't mind my coming unannounced.
I had no idea... Don't mention it.
it's lovely to meet you again.
how is Raymond?
you know my nephew. Footloose and fancy-free.
like you, Lucy.
and long may it be so.
I do what I do, I see who I see
I meet who I meet, and it's glorious.
it's lovely to meet you again, but...
of course. Now.
I couldn't pay nearly your normal rate but Raymond said he'd help.
everything I know about you convinces me you'll take it on.
you want to engage me? Yes.
would you like an adventure?
possibly.
it's quite a challenge.
very possibly.
I want you to find a body.
hello. Lucy Eyelesbarrow.
I'm Emma Crackenthorpe. What a smart car.
thank you.
Wow! Look at that car.
lovely, isn't it, boys? Boys?
don't touch. Come in.
we only occupy this wing now, my father and myself.
though, as I said, there's family for Christmas.
which is why I advertised.
that was my brother-in-law Bryan, and the boy Alexander's his.
James is a school chum.
you have a sister. I envy you.
just brothers, me.
Edie died, having Alexander.
I'm so sorry.
would you wait here? I'll see if my father's ready for you.
the Gobstopper King.
sorry. David Quimper, Miss Eyelesbarrow.
Emma said you were starting.
is someone ill?
well, not more than usual.
I've given him the once-over, Luther - Mr. Crackenthorpe.
but I really came here to talk to Emma.
that's Luther's father.
sir Marcus. Crackenthorpe Confectionary.
rotting the nation's teeth since 1881.
you surely had a Nougatine Twirly in your time.
I don't think so.
or a Choco-Melty Bar.
Oh, yes. Wasn't I sick?
miss Eyelesbarrow.
excuse me.
thank you Dr. Quimper.
doctor
I'm delving for your name.
it has a definite Anglo-Saxon something about it.
it's not in the Chronicles.
I wondered if I'd seen it in lvanhoe.
isn't there an Aynseborrow, though, in Hereward the Wake?
perhaps you're thinking of that. Hereward the Wake?
Charles Kingsley.
Yes, I know.
I'll dust off my copy and have a look.
has Emma explained everything?
we two manage with a local girl who comes in most weekdays, so you won't quite be on your own.
she's twice a week now.
why is that? Money again?
never mind.
there's Alfred. I'll go down.
Alfred's my eldest son.
sponging a buckshee Christmas again.
who else will be here?
just Bryan and the boys and Alfred.
it's a pity you won't get to meet Cedric.
he has to fly off again tomorrow.
he's the only free spirit among them.
he paints in Spain.
well, lbiza.
if I were younger...
Oh, and Alfred's with Jacqueline, his girl.
observe, if you will, Miss. Eyelesbarrow, the sheer tawdriness of Jacqueline Briggs.
there's no-one with him. He must have ditched her.
Where's Jacqueline?
miss. Eyelesbarrow?
dine with us tonight.
I'll be in the kitchen. Mr. Crackenthorpe
for me?
just up here. Yes.
just mind your head there. Oh. See what I mean?
Oh, this is perfectly charming, Tom. And so kind.
I just had a fancy for a change from village life.
in Brackhampton? There's a Roman wall, isn't there?
about three feet of it behind the municipal swimming pool.
and an interesting church.
it's not that interesting.
there's a Norman window in the east wall, I suppose.
I've got a guide book of St Matthews if you really want to have a look at...
not to worry. Never mind.
there's my lift to work.
we're quite busy, actually. Are you?
will you be staying long?
I did wonder, have you made plans for Christmas?
no.
do you know, I'd be delighted
miss. Marple, absolutely delighted.
hello. Mr. Eastley.
the boys want to know if you make treacle sponge pudding.
you can tell them I'm famous for it.
can I be useful?
I don't know. Can you?
scrape the carrots.
what is wrong with Mr. Crackenthorpe?
well, grief mostly.
despair, his eldest son, his wife.
his daughter.
miss. Crackenthorpe told me about your wife. I'm sorry.
sure.
what happened to...Edmund, was it?
u-boat in the Atlantic. Just after Luther lost Agnes.
ten years ago last week she died.
last week? December 4th.
Tuesday.
Yes.
we always gather to remember her.
why don't I take this to the trash? No, no. no.
waste not, want not.
that's the one for Christmas dinner.
with prune and chestnut stuffing.
now, that I am famous for.
anglo-saxon for, "What an excellent dinner." More or less.
Bryan did the sprouts. I bet he did.
what will we do for tart without your precious Jacqueline?
dad, please. Don't embarrass Miss Eyelesbarrow.
Jackie and I...
I don't even know where she is and I care even less.
