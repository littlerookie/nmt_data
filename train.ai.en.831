I mean, for all we know, it's from another planet and it flew here.
like Superman? Yeah, exactly like...
wait. You know who Superman is?
Oh, my God. You know who Superman is?
okay, I'm not... I'm, like, feeling something.
are you aware of Garfield? A lot of people think he's from a planet that he's not actually from.
I just can't stop thinking about how the last thing I said to her was, " Good luck tonight, Travis. "
she knows you didn't mean that.
when I think of some of the things I said to Jason...
no, that's different. Why?
Jason knew you loved him.
Hey, do you guys remember a couple of years ago, when that guy was lighting homeless people on fire in the subways?
Jesus, Hud. What?
it's maybe not the best topic for conversation down here.
right.
I just can't stop thinking how scary it would be if a flaming homeless guy came out of the dark right now. Hud, seriously.
seriously. I'm just saying. Sorry.
what was that? Let's just keep moving.
holy shit! Oh, God, this is nasty.
this is disgusting.
they're all running in the same direction.
Yeah, like they're running away. From what?
Hey, how much farther?
I don't know. Let's get out at the next station.
okay? Yeah.
did you guys hear that?
what is that? Just listen.
I don't see anything. Do you guys?
Oh, man, this is the worst.
will you be quiet for five seconds?
Oh, turn on the night vision. What?
what do you mean? It's right here.
I got it. It's right here. There.
is it on?
Oh, shit. What? What?
run. Okay, run. Okay, run. What?
Hey, let's start running! Just run! Just run! Just start running right now!
start running now! Run, run, run! Run! Just run!
Lily! You guys!
wait.
Oh, God! Help! Please help! You guys, help!
Marlena! Here!
come on. Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!
Hud!
...there you go. Totally not what I was thinking...
how are you doing over there, Marlena?
you okay?
you tell me.
how does it look?
looks like it hurts.
what do you mean? You're saying this isn't attractive, like, at all?
a little bit.
here. Here, here. You can wash it off. Thanks.
here. Did it get you, Hud? Did it bite you, man?
no, it didn't get me.
okay. Okay.
Hey. Hey.
so those things came out of nowhere, right?
Yeah. Oh, man.
that one that grabbed me, it was trying to drag me away.
what's up with that?
maybe it liked you, Hud. Yeah.
maybe it was trying to make me its queen.
Hey, thanks for coming back and helping me out, you know?
what? You think that I'm the kind of person that wouldn't do that?
no. No. I know you aren't.
I was just saying, like, I'm glad you did.
otherwise, I would have been totally dead.
right?
it's okay. You just got bit.
Hey.
Marlena's hurt pretty bad, you know?
well, we could wait here for a little bit, I guess, and just hope those things don't make it through the door.
Yeah, okay. What's the next option? Well.
okay, we could see what's out through this way.
maybe find another tunnel.
no, no more tunnels.
then, I don't know. We try our luck up top.
okay, just to be clear, so our options are die here, die in the tunnels, or die in the streets. ls that...
Yeah, pretty much. ...pretty much the summing up of it?
but wait, we don't even know where we are, right?
so, let's just go up and look around. See if we recognize anything.
do you think you'll be okay to walk?
no, I'm fine. I'm fine. Here, I'll help you.
we're at 59th. We're at 59th.
Yeah. We're at 59th.
that's weird.
what?
Yeah.
Hello!
Marlena?
what's wrong? Are you okay?
I'm really... I'm dizzy.
Yeah. Do you wanna sit down for a second?
no, I'm fine. She needs a doctor.
you sure? I'm totally fine.
you know, 'cause we could sit down if you want to.
no, I'm fine, I'm fine.
we've got civilians! Are there any more of you?
no, just us four. It's just us.
we got four civilians here.
okay, bring them in, Roger.
let's go, move. Move it. Okay, okay.
let's go! Okay, okay.
excuse me, sir? Sir? Excuse me.
listen, we need your help. Our friend, she's hurt. She's trapped in her building right by here, at Columbus Circle.
that is not where you wanna be right now.
do you guys know what it is? Out there?
do you know what that thing is?
if they know, they ain't telling me.
whatever it is, it's winning.
what's up? We got another bite here.
don't look at that. Gross.
please, we can't stay here. We have...
Hey, not now.
copy that. Sir, we have two F18s on route from Selfridge. Four more are arming up, maybe 30 minutes out. Roger that.
listen up, people. Rack them and pack them.
we're phantoms in 15. Sir.
where the hell did you find them?
they were in the tunnels.
Yeah, we had to walk all the way from Spring Street.
get them ready for transport, put them on the evac chopper.
Yes, sir. Let's move. Move, move. No, wait. Wait.
listen, our friend is very badly hurt. Move it.
move. Move. We have to get to her.
sorry, son, can't help you. Get them on the chopper.
no, but, please, listen to me. Let go! Just listen for a second, please!
turn that goddamned camera...
we've been trying to get to her all... Make our own way.
no, do you have a...
I am not jeopardizing this operation, or my men. I don't want your help.
you are getting on that chopper now.
l just need you to listen to me for one second, sir.
you have no idea what's out there.
I don't care what's out there.
listen to me. She's dying.
there is nothing I can do about that now.
the girl that I love more than anything is dying and it's my fauIt.
she should have been with me tonight, and I let her go and...
and l get it, okay? You have your hands full. I get that.
I get that, but we're gonna go after her, and if you wanna stop me, then you're gonna have to shoot me. Hud.
I don't feel so good. Oh, shit.
bite! We've got a bite! Marlena.
hold on a second. Get her moving.
keep moving!
Hey, Marlena, are you okay? Hey, what are you guys doing?
hold on a second. Where are you taking her?
hold on a second. Wait! Oh, my God, wait!
Marlena, stop! Just wait a second! Let me go.
just wait a second. Please. Let me go.
wait! Marlena! Get out of the way.
Marlena! Hold on a second!
just wait a... Let go of me! Stop it! No.
God! Please, God! Where are you taking Marlena?
wait a second.
it's over. There is nothing you can do.
there is nothing you can do for her now. It is over. It's over.
rogers, clear out of here. You sure?
I'll get them to the choppers from here.
let's move out. Oh, my God.
what just happened?
let's go. I shouldn't be doing this shit.
come on. Come on. Okay.
let's go. Move. Okay, okay.
let's go, move. Come on.
you gotta listen to me.
this girl, her building, it's at Columbus Circle?
yeah? If you wanna go out in this,
I ain't gonna stop you. But you gotta know something.
the government's considering the hammer down protocol, which means they're willing to let this whole area go.
you mean Midtown? No, I mean Manhattan.
come on. We're taking one last shot at this thing.
Oh, God. If that doesn't work, they're leveling the whole goddamned city.
your watch is still working? Yeah?
all right. The airlifts are leaving from 40th and Park.
last chopper's wheelsup at exactly 06:00.
if you can make it there, then they'll get you out.
okay. Okay, thank you. 58th Street's right there.
now, go. Move, move, move. Let's go.
let's go. Go, go, go.
this is like a nightmare, you know. It all happened so fast,
I couldn't even really see what happened to her.
I mean, did you see it? Could you see what happened, Hud?
no, her eyes started bleeding, and then they were screaming she was bitten.
and then she wouldn't stop bleeding. And then...
Hud.
you okay? Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay.
look, guys, I don't mean to be... But we don't have a lot of time.
okay, so maybe you guys should just stay here, and l'll go.
all right?
I'm sorry. I just...
no, no, we're coming. We're coming.
are you sure?
no, no, man. No, we have to do this, okay?
we're with you. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go right now.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. What?
Oh, my God. What is it? What?
shit. That's not Beth's place, is it?
Oh, my God. Is that Beth's apartment?
Oh, my God. Rob. ls that her place?
tell me that's not her place. That's her place, yeah.
Oh, shit. I don't suppose she lives on the ground floor.
no, 39th.
Oh, great. How do we even get up there?
I don't know. We just go inside and then see how high we can get.
I don't know if l can do that.
well, maybe we could try going up the other building, and then see if there's a place to cross over onto her roof.
and then we could find some way down to her place.
wait. No, never mind. No, that's a bad idea.
Hey, that's a bad idea. I take that back.
no one ever listens to me, ever. And now, of course, they listen to me.
great.
shit. Shit.
probably not working.
what's going on? Not working.
wait, wait. Let's just... Maybe...
no? No? Shit.
well, why don't you take the stairs?
you guys see that guy's face when Lily asked him what it was?
I mean, they have no idea.
unless they're, like, in on it. Jesus, Hud.
I don't read the papers.
maybe our government made this thing. Oh, yeah.
I mean, you know, maybe it was an accident, or maybe it was on purpose... Sure, maybe they did.
does it really matter right now? Yeah.
it matters because l need to talk about something.
otherwise, I'm actually probably going to shit my pants in this stairwell.
I'm sorry.
Hey, wait, wait. You guys hear that? You guys hear that?
Yes. Yeah.
Yeah, I think we're getting close.
Hud, I'm gonna check this floor.
okay.
okay, like, I think it's like, two more up, I think.
okay.
guys, guys, guys.
this one, it's got to be. It's got to be this one.
Oh, God.
I don't think there's anybody here. No.
Oh, Jesus. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Okay.
okay, now, we can do this. We can totally do this.
I don't know, Rob. Look, it's a straight shot.
I don't know. I'm sorry. Lily, Lily, it's a straight shot.
look, it's a straight shot. We could use... There's pipes there.
we could use the air conditioners. Okay?
come on. We came this far.
we can do it. I'll go first.
okay, okay, okay. Yes. All right? Okay.
okay, I'll document it. Be careful, okay?
come on. Come on. Okay. Okay.

it's 6: 42 a. m. on Saturday, May 23.
approximately seven hours ago, something attacked the city.
I don't know what it is.
if you found this tape... I mean, if you're watching this right now, then you probably know more about it than l do.
whatever it is, it killed my brother,
Jason Hawkins.
it killed my best friend,
Hudson Platt, and Marlena Diamond, and many, many others.
we've crashed here in Central Park and taken sheIter under this bridge.
the military has begun bombing the creature and we're caught in the middle.
okay. Ready?
it's okay.
Beth, look at me. I don't know what to say.

I love you. I love you.
I know what I'm talking about. Come on, admit it.
you are going to miss me a little bit, right?
Yeah, we'll see.
okay, yeah, all right.
all right, we're almost out of tape. We got, like, three seconds left.
what do you wanna say? What do you wanna say?
last thing to the camera.
I had a good day.
Yeah! Nice job! Nice pass!
St, Francis High School basketball phenom
ty Crane, who they recruited just last year, is widely held as the next LeBron James.
we simply know him as "The Crane."
come on.
come on, y"all! Timo, let"s go man, come on.
Yeah, whatever.
where you at? Where you at?
pick him up! Pick him up!
Hey, son. - Hey.
right here, right here.
blue ball! - Good D, baby!
Damn! - What the hell are you doing, y"all?
you took three steps this way. - Yo, l put my fist up, man.
yo, homey, look where you"re throwing the ball, man. Damn.
get your man! - l knew it. l knew it.
St. Francis is up by 22.
stay out of my way, bitch. l own you.
Oh, hell no! - Bitch!
let me go! - Hey! Hey!
l"m good. Get off me!
get off me, get off me!
that"s it! Game"s over!
Game"s over!
crane. Great game, great game.
tell everyone out there what it feels like to be the next LeBron James.
lebron James? l"m the only Ty Crane.
all right, you heard it here first, "the only Ty Crane."
why do all the benchwarmers always got something to say?
we watching the damn game, that"s why.
you got a good view, huh? - Yeah.
ty Crane outscored our whole team by himself.
wonder how that happened. - We had nothing but 32 points.
l got 12 of them. What did you get, Kenyon?
just shut up, dog. The Crane swooped down on you and delivered a basket of beat-down. He clowned you, dog.
Yeah, you better shut the hell up. - He had you on lock the whole game.
Lyle, why don"t you shut your mouth before l close it for good.
you didn"t do shit either the whole game.
what, homey? l will slap the taste out your mouth!
can we all just get along? - Shut your little ass up!
you didn"t even play! - That"s what l"m talking about.
Shay, pass the ball, dog! - You got two points in 1 6 minutes, - that"s why coach got rid of your ass. - Exactly!
Timo, you was in the whole time, you never even touched the rock.
you didn"t do shit. You might as well.
who was you passing the ball to? - You were playing and didn"t do shit!
Kenny Ray Carter, Richmond High School all-American, 1972.
good to see you, sir.
l was really happy to see you in the stands tonight.
l have to tell you, sir, l haven"t made up my mind yet.
as l"ve told you, it"s time for me to step down.
last few years have been really tough.
well, losing"s hard, sir.
this isn"t about losing games, Kenny.
l can"t get them to show up for school, for practice.
l can"t get parents involved, and l"m done chasing kids in the streets and pulling them into the gym.
Yeah, it"s a tough job.
Richmond is a tough little city.
when l saw you here tonight, l thought, "l got him. He"s in."
well, actually, l was here for another reason.
my son plays for St. Francis.
he does?
which kid was he? - Well, you didn"t see him.
He"s a freshman. He didn"t play. - That"s great. Great school.
what, you wanna go?
Hey! - Lyle, bring it!
let him go. You think everybody"s scared of you? l ain"t scared of you!
Cruz, chill, man. Why you gotta be trying to act all hard all the time, man?
God, l"m sick of you, man!
you know, that school was rough when l went there.
lt"s way beyond that now.
well, then, just forget about it. Don"t even discuss it again.
l can"t quite do that. Coach officially offered me the job tonight.
the clock"s ticking.
and when you say ""offering job,"" there"s usually money involved.
Yeah, there might be a thousand bucks in it for me.
for five months of work?
Oh, well, you can"t say no to that.
and the team, it"s so bad.
those boys, they"re so angry and undisciplined.
and besides, you know, you don"t have the time.
you"re trying to open up a second store.
exactly, l don"t have the-- Hell, l don"t have any time.
and you promised to take your girlfriend to Mexico.
and l"m definitely keeping that promise.
there"s no way l"m not going to Mexico and hanging out on the beach with you in your bikini.
l can"t take that job.
so when do you start?
you should"ve spoken to me first. - Why?
lt was a personal choice for me. - So, what happens to me?
you still gonna come to my games?
l"ll probably miss most of your games, Damien. l"m sorry.
then l"ll go to Richmond and play for you.
no.
well, why not?
dad, you"ve always been my coach. - This is a great school, Damien.
lt puts you in a great position for college.
dad, l"m a freshman!
just because l"m coaching at Richmond, it doesn"t change our plans for your future, all right?
yo, my man, l need a vial, man. You got that good dope? How much?
you forgot to bring your lD, didn"t you?
l forgot it. - Every day.
good morning. Ken Carter.
Thanks. - Here you go, sir.
Hey, yo, what"s up?
nice to see you again, Mr. Carter. - You too, ma"am.
lf the offer still stands, l"d like to coach the team.
well, l hope you"re up for the task. These young men need discipline.
the job comes with a ＄1500 stipend and a major time commitment for the next four months.
l accept. - Great.
we"re thrilled to have you. Gentlemen, l hate to be abrupt, but l do have a budget meeting l need to run to.
Mr. Carter, is there anything you need from us?
well, l just need about 25 copies of this document.
l"m all set. - Ray, would you see to it that Mr. Carter--? Coach Carter gets these copies?
will do. - Gentlemen.
l"m not saying this is not gonna be a challenge, but, Kenny, you know the deal here.
just keep in mind, these are good boys.
guys! Guys!
guys!
now, as you know, l"ve been-- Hey!
you know l"ve been looking for a new coach to take over for me this season.
this is Ken Carter. He went to Richmond.
he was a two-sport all-American.
still holds records for scoring, assists, steals.
basketball scholarship to George Mason University.
we"re lucky to have Coach Carter.
now, let"s give him the respect he"s due.
they"re all yours, coach. - Thank you, sir.
good afternoon, young men.
as Coach White said, l"m your new basketball coach, Ken Carter.
l guess l need to speak louder so you can hear me.
l"m Ken Carter, your new basketball coach.
we hear you, dog. But we can"t see you.
the glare from your big, black-ass head is hella shiny, man. Damn, do you buff it?
Oh, you got jokes to go along with that ugly jump shot of yours, huh?
first of all, if you need to know my credentials, as Coach White said, they"re on the wall there behind you.
secondly, if basketball practice starts at 3, you are late as of 2: 55.
you, shooting the ball. What"s your name, sir?
Jason Lyle, but l ain"t no sir.
you"re not a sir.
well, are you a madam?
little bitch. Bitch. - As of now, you are a sir.
so are the rest of you.
"sir" is a term of respect.
and you will have my respect until you abuse it.
Mr. Lyle, how many games did you guys win last season?
like four wins, 22 losses.
sir. - Sir.
l"m going to give you contracts.
lf you sign and honor your side of them, we are going to be successful.
damn, do l get a signing bonus for signing this contract?
Yes, sir. You get to become a winner.
because if there"s one thing l know, it is this:
the losing stops now.
starting today, you will play like winners, act like winners, and most importantly, you will be winners.
lf you listen and learn, you"ll win basketball games.
and, gentlemen, winning in here...is the key to winning out there.
this contract states that you will maintain a 2. 3 grade point average.
you will attend all your classes and you will sit in the front row of those classes.
yo, this a country-ass nigga, dog. - Excuse me.

right. - That"s what you wanna say, right?
and what is your name, sir?
l"m Timo Cruz, sir.
well, Mr. Cruz and Mr. Worm, what you should both know is we treat ourselves with respect.
we don"t use the word "nigga."
are you some preacher man or some shit?
because God ain"t gonna do you no good in this neighborhood.
l live in this neighborhood, sir. - Sir.
can you believe this uppity Negro, sir?
okay, Mr. Cruz...
...leave the gym right now. - For what?
l"ll ask you one last time to leave the gym - before l help you leave. - Before you what?
do you even know who l am?
from what l can see, a very confused and scared young man.
scared of who? Scared of you? l"m supposed to be scared of you?
nigga, l ain"t scared of nobody. l will lay your ass out.
l don"t think so.
all right.

now, l cannot teach you the game of basketball until your conditioning is at a level that allows me to do so.
gentlemen, report to the baseline.
to the baseline!
l presume you all know what suicides are.
so...
l saw the St. Francis game the other night.
none of you have a problem shooting the ball.
you all had a problem getting up and down the court.
lf you are late, you will run.
lf you give me attitude, you will do push-ups.
so you can push-up or shut up.
that"s up to you.
yo, how many we gonna do? - Sir.
yo, sir, how many we gonna do?
Let"s see how many you can do in one hour and seven minutes.
fellas, don"t make me commit homicide.

why not? Worm"s the man. - Worm is Worm.
anyway, l got something for the baby today.
we don"t even know if it"s a baby yet. l mean, it"s kind of early.
you ain"t even been to the doctor yet.
Hello? l passed the pregnancy test, Kenyon. Three times.
these are kind of cute, though. - l know, l got good taste, right?
Yeah, all right.
precious little shoes.
well, l got a little somethin"-somethin" for you too.
thank you.
this definitely is a little something.
Where"d you get this? - Don"t sleep on the 99 Cent Store.
what? What"s up? - What are you doing? Give me!
are you crazy? - Are you crazy?
you got that for 99 cents? l"ve been there.
you can get three brooms and a bucket for 99 cents, with some toilet paper.

push! Go! Go! Let me hear you!
come on, close out! Explode! Let"s go!
sir, you"re 20 minutes late.
that"s ten suicides for the whole team, 250 push-ups for you.
this ain"t the track team, man.
nor is it the debate team, Mr. Lyle.
but you"re right.
and because you"re right, that"s 20 suicides for the entire team and you get the privilege of joining Mr. Battle - with 250 push-ups of your own. - What, are you serious?
Yeah. - This is bullshit!
good answer, Mr. Battle.
Johnny, tell him what he"s won.
because you gave such a good answer and you gave the coach attitude, you win the bonus prize of 500 push-ups!
and would you like to go for the grand prize of a thousand?
no, sir.
to the baseline! On my whistle! Let"s go!
J. B. come on, baby.
l can"t even move, son. Like, every muscle on my body hurts.
you can"t say nothing to him. - Why can"t l say nothing to him?
l"m a white boy? Man, what the--?

that"s some bullshit, Cruz!
yo, l"m gonna visit you in County, dog.
l"m just playing, B. Look at you!
Damn! l seen y"all walking from up the block like somebody put a pipe in your asses.
you all right, dog?
look, y"all wasn"t winning with me, but y"all damn sure look sad without me.
but you know what? l"m gonna watch y"all play.
see y"all get your asses kicked.
yo! l"d love to shoot the shit with you bitches all night, but l gotta go.
all right. - Yo, who that, man?
that"s my cousin, Renny.
l"m gonna check y"all. Come on, let"s go.
yo, Worm, you need a ride?
no, l"m straight, man. - You sure?
Yeah, l"m good. - All right, my nigga.
one love. - All right, Lyle!
don"t let nobody else put a pipe up your ass, or you might like it!
Hey, you was scared, huh? l wasn"t scared.
the state only requires that they have a 2.0 average to play.
now, you got in here they need a 2.3.
lf you have a 2.0, you have to score at least 1050 on the SAT to be eligible for an athletic scholarship.
lf you have a 2.3, you only need 950.
now, 2.3 is just a C-plus.
lt shouldn"t be that hard to maintain a C-plus.
these boys are student athletes.
student comes first.
lt says they gotta wear coat and ties on game days.
they don"t own ties! You gonna supply the ties?
there"s a Goodwill and a Salvation Army store less than two blocks from here.
they got a box full of ties for 50 cents apiece.
yo, man, what you trying to say, huh?
Oh, we too good to shop at the Goodwill and Salvation Army, is that it?
Yeah, l ain"t that broke. - This is crazy!
a dress code and they have to sit in the front row in class?
this is basketball, man! - And basketball is a privilege, ma"am.
lf you want to play basketball on this team, these are the simple rules you have to follow if you want to enjoy that privilege.
now, if you decide to follow these simple rules, l need you and the boys to sign this contract.
they can bring the contracts to practice tomorrow.
lf you come to practice.
l wanna thank you all for coming out and showing your support, and l hope l have your support the rest of the season.
good night. - Get up and leave like that?
how you gonna make them wear ties? - l want the other coach back!
lt"s one of your contracts, sir. l"ve amended that contract.
you require your players to maintain a 2. 3 grade point average.
l"ve committed to maintaining a 3. 5.
you require ten hours of community service, and l"ve committed to 50.
any unexcused absences, any other disciplinary issues at school, you can nullify this agreement and send me to any school you want.
and how many days do l have to consider this offer?
none.
the second page is a letter you need to sign that confirms my withdrawal from St. Francis.
they know l"m leaving. - What?
you withdrew from St. Francis? - l called Richmond.
they expect me there in the morning. - You called Richmond?
you should have spoken to me about this.
lt was a personal choice for me.
well, l can fix all that in the morning.
sir, please listen. All l wanna do is play for you.
lf l"m one of the top students at Richmond, l mean one of the top in the whole school, and l have great SATs, l can go to any college in the country.
l"m asking you to trust me.
you really wanna do this, huh?
okay.
part of growing up is making your own decisions and living with the consequences.
3. 7.
and you will earn every minute of playing time.
open it, please.
morning, sir.
say what? - You might think l'm wrong.
Hey, yo, yo, yo. lt"s Malcolm X from St. Francis.
Hey, yo, Malcolm! - Whatever.
what"s up, man? - What are you doing here, son?
l transferred to Richmond. - Oh, no, son, l think you"re just lost.
well, l am actually lost. Can you tell me how to get to...?
Bel Air? Hey, yo, Worm, tell your man Fresh Prince here - how to get to his mansion. - Fresh bitch.
l hope seeing you in this hallway mean l get to see you on the court today.
l can"t wait. With your five browns.
everybody up.
today we"re going to play defense.
sorry, sir.
gentlemen, this is a new player, Damien Carter.
he is my son, and he is late.
sir, you owe me 20 suicides.
sir, it"s my first day of school, l had to stay--
basketball practice starts at 3.
as of 2: 55, you are late. Get changed in the locker room.
do your suicides on the far side of the court so as not to disturb us.
all right, gentlemen, give me two lines!
okay, young sirs, we"re gonna take it to the next level.
everything l knew about basketball, l learned from women.
l have a sister, her name"s Diane.
she was always on my case about every little thing.
matter of fact, she still is.
turn down that radio! You eat the last piece of cake?
did you drink all the Kool-Aid?
she was always in my face.
so when l call "Diane."
we"re gonna play straight man-to-man pressure defense.
worm! No, no, no, no, sir.
look at your defensive posture.
come on. Split your man. Back straight, butt down.
this hand guards against the passing lane, this hand protects the crossover.
all right? Palms up! Get your head in the game.
now we have Delilah.
she was my childhood sweetheart.
sir, was she hot?
Oh, yes, sir. She was steaming hot.
but she was the devil. That girl was evil.
l remember once she tricked me into stealing brownies from Christ the King First Baptist Church bake sale.
she smiled and got her way out of it, while l damn near had to wear a pillow on my butt for a month before l could sit down.
Delilah, gentlemen. She"s our trap defense.
take notes, freshman. This is as close as you gonna get to playing.
come on, come on. Move, move! Delilah! Delilah! Delilah!
now, l know you"re all concerned that we didn"t work on our offense during practice.
we have all season to do that.
but what did we do in practice, Mr. Stone?
run. - That"s right.
so, what do you think l want you to do on offense tonight?
run? - Correct again.
l want you to run.
l want you to run every second that clock is ticking, all game long,
put him back on the bench!
nice pass, baby!
push it! Push it!
worm. - Let"s go, Worm.
stay alert! Pick him up right there!
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah! - What"s the call, ref?
white four, fifth. He"s out of the game.
Oh, ref, come-- - That"s his fifth foul, coach.
time, sir. - Time out, white.
bad call, ref! That was a jump ball, damn it!
time out, white. - Come on, fellas.
Carter, you"re in. - But, coach, he a freshman.
you wanna coach?
all right, take a deep breath, guys. Come on, deep breaths.
you tired? - No, sir.
those guys are exhausted.
that"s why this guy"s gonna miss that free throw.
when he does, Worm and Lyle are our first option.
push the ball. Go hard to the hole. Everybody attack the boards, got that?
Yes, sir. - All right, Richmond on three.
one, two, three! - Richmond!
all right, let"s out, all right? - Step it up, let"s go!
look alive out there.
all right, guys, you"re in better shape than they are. Push it.
box out, box out.
one shot.
kenyon, right here. Kenyon!
come on! Come on! - Come on, baby!
all right.
worm! - Yo, yo.
Oh, yeah!
Yeah! That"s what l"m talking about!
tight pass, baby. Nice pass, dog. - lt was all you.
a win like that don"t mean nothing, because they can"t play anyway, you feel me?
okay, Shaq, so you dominated down low tonight. Any thoughts?
l dropped a 20-piece. Kobe played his game.
we the champions till we ain"t the champions no more.
yo, man, on the real, that was the worst game l"ve ever seen in my life.
l thought that shit would never end. l was dying in the bleachers.
that"s right, you were in the bleachers, weren"t you?
we were on the court handling our business.
that"s right. We 1 -0, bitch.
yo, on the real, Hercules is weak, B, and y"all barely beat them.
damn, Timo, why you throwing salt, man?
we undefeated. Show us love, son.
Yeah, that"s right, we undefeated.
l"ll knock all y"all off.
yo. l"ll check y"all later, all right? - All right.
what"s up? - Here"s two bundles.
all right. - Yo, be careful. The block is hot.
yo, l got you.
how you doing, man? - Chilling, man.
you look good.
got some paper for you.
now we"re talking, yeah.
how you living, Timo?
l"m good.
you all right? For real? - Yeah.
here, take some. - l"m all right.
no, no, no, take some, please.
you did good, man. You"re doing good, bro.
thank you. - Don"t thank me, thank you.
you earned it.
take a nickel bag, okay?
go get yourself something, man.
l"m gonna see you? - Yeah, next week.
okay, l"m gonna see you.
keep it up. - Yeah.
Hey, Shaqua, Denise, holler at me,
Rafeca, l see you looking.
ain"t nobody thinking about you, Worm.
Oh, okay. - Gentlemen, let"s review the Hercules game, shall we?
yo, yell out my numbers, sir.
Mr. Worm, you were five and four.
no, sir. l had 12 points and eight assists, sir.
no, sir, Mr. Worm. You had five turnovers and four missed free throws.
now, we"re talking about fundamentals here.
until we learn them, l"m adding a practice every morning at 6 a.m.
six a.m? - We shot 56 percent at...
Mr. Cruz.
are you lost, sir?
what l gotta do to play?
Mr. Cruz, you do not want to know the answer to that question.
now, as l was saying, as a team, we shot 56 percent from the line.
from now on, before you leave my gym, you must pay an exit price of 50 made free throws before you can go.
what? - That"s everybody.
come on. - That"s a lot of free throws.
okay, Mr. Cruz.
before you can play on this team...
...you owe me...
...2, 500 push-ups...
...and 1 , 000 suicides.
damn. - Damn.
and they must be completed by Friday.
he ain"t finishing that by Friday. - He ain"t making that.
today"s flavor: offense.
now we talking. - Now, l have a sister.
her name is Linda.
Linda is smart, she"s political.
well, actually, she"s radical.
Linda"s got a big Afro.
Linda is our pick-and-roll offense.
before we get into that, let"s warm up.
give me a lay-up line.
Let"s go. - All right.
damn, how many sisters he got? - Who knows.
come on, get two more over here. - Break it out.
Let"s go, guys. - Energy, guys, energy.
we got this, let"s go.
l"m open. - l got him, l got him.
right here, right here. l"m open. l"m open.
l"m sorry.
all right. - Hey, hey, hey.
come on. - lt"s not my fault.
he was early. - Hey.
Yes, it"s important to move without the ball, but you gotta be patient on the weak-side screen.
set up your man and come off his shoulder hard. Okay?
okay. Switch it up.
what is your deepest fear, Mr. Cruz?
that you"re inadequate?
give up, Mr. Cruz.
go home.
all right, l want seven passes before you shoot.
seven. - All right.
you know your task is impossible before Friday, right?
move.
work it, work it.
what time your mom getting home?
she doesn"t get off for another hour.
Oh, that"s Myles.
what?
say, "Hi, Uncle Kenyon."
all right, don"t worry about it.
He"ll go back to sleep right after his bottle.
right, boo-boo?
Yeah, probably in time for your mom to get home.
or when your cousin get back from getting her hair fried and dyed, like she can afford all that shit. lt"s her baby anyway.
well, my mother had to work a double shift, but they cut her overtime.
and my cousin, don"t be trying to dis her.
you said we"d be alone. You call this alone?
well, that"s why we need our own spot.
did you turn this off?
Yeah, it was boiling. - Oh, come on.
well, turn it down, not off.
this is milk, butter and cheese. We can"t afford to waste this.
and hold him up.
making the baby"s bottle for Myles.
all right, Myles, here we go.
gotta cool off a minute.
ever think about what you were gonna do before you were pregnant?
what you mean, going to junior college?
Yeah.
l mean, yeah, l thought about it.
l could go later, l guess.
you have to get some work after you have the baby.
me too.
so l"ll work. - How you gonna go to school?
why you asking me all these questions?
and you gotta put your hands under his arm.
you gotta sit him on your chest. Hold him.
l am holding him. - You ain"t doing it right.
you gotta soothe him, Kenyon.
look...
l don"t know how to do this.
you"ll get it.
right?
look, l gotta help my mom with some stuff.
see you later, all right? - All right.
call me later, okay?
later.
all right, keep it riding on somebody.
don"t get lost in there. - Move it. Move it.
stay with your man.
box out, box out! - Position.
Hey, hey, hey.
you don"t get to your man, stand, watch the ball.
when the ball goes up, get in good defensive position, get your body on your man and explode to the ball.
all right? Let"s go.
go on, do it. - Forward pass. Forward pass.
work it. - There you go.
l wish you would. Yes, ma"am, l"m here all week.
Mr. Carter, how are the boys?
Oh, they"re great, ma"am. We"re 1 -0.
very good.
how may l help you?
well, l had my boys sign contracts requiring them to meet certain academic standards.
Yes, l believe one of the faculty members mentioned that.
very interesting scare tactic.
well, in order for that to be successful, l need their teachers to fill out weekly progress reports so l"ll know how the boys are doing in their classrooms.
okay. - Well, l haven"t received anything from their teachers.
l don"t see how this ties in to your job as the basketball coach, Mr. Carter.
well, l took this job with the understanding l could do it my way.
and you can.
our next faculty meeting is in two weeks.
l"ll remember to bring it up.
why, that would be great. Thank you, ma"am.
thank you, sir.
bring it in, guys.
Let"s go, hustle up.
all right, that"s it for today.
we have a game tomorrow, so get some rest tonight.
and remember, ties and jackets tomorrow.
Mr. Cruz.
l"m impressed with what you"ve done.
but you came up short.
you owe me 80 suicides and 500 push-ups.
please leave my gym.
Thanks, Clyde.
gentlemen, see you tomorrow.
l"ll do push-ups for him.
you said we"re a team.
one person struggles, we all struggle.
one player triumphs, we all triumph, right?
l"ll do some.
l"ll run suicides too.
l"ll do some too.
Clyde, keep count.
call me when they"re done.
defense! Defense!
push it. Push it. Move, move!
Yeah! - Go.
move your feet, move your feet.
worm. - White ball.
palms up, move your feet, right? Come out. Come out. Come out.
Hey, hey.
what is your deepest fear, young man?
go on.
why he keep saying that, "What"s your deepest fear?" What that mean?
move. Move. Move.
no, one more pass.
hands up.
three points, Cruz!
what the hell are you doing, Cruz? You allergic to lay-ups?
you do that again and you"re going to be glued to the bench.
come on, last kick.
kick it in. Kick it in. Let"s go.
you can"t guard me, can you? What you gonna do?
can"t do nothing about it, can you? - Delilah. Delilah.
come on, come on, come on.
shot. - Yeah, Jason.
kenyon, pose for me.
smile. - Kenyon! Maddux! Get back!
just play the damn game.
that"s me, baby. That"s me. l did that.
l drew that up. Yeah.
run it again.
all right, 1 -4, 1 -4. Linda, Linda, Linda!
all day, baby. All day! Can"t stop that.
can"t stop that!
Hey, coach, your shoe"s untied, sir. - Thank you, Mr. Worm.
look at that bow. Look at that.
l tied that. l tied that shit.
can l get something on the bow? Let me get some.
are you crazy?
what is wrong with you?
what"s wrong with all of you?
since when is winning not enough?
playing hard not enough?
no, you have to humiliate your opponent.
taunt him after every score.
you won four games last season.
four.
what gives you the right to taint the game that l love with trash talk and taunting?
what gives you the right to wear Richmond on your chests and act like punks?
coach, they were jawing too. - So?
you can"t show some class?
act like a champion?
you owe me 500 push-ups apiece.
on the line. Now.
listen, shorty, l"m just gonna be real with you, okay?
you"re my girl.
l get out on that court and everything is just getting crazy, all l gotta do is just think about you.
Mr. Lyle.
why aren"t you in...
...geometry? - l"m going there right now, sir.
sir, this is Betty. - Bella.
Bella. Bella. This is Bella, sir.
go to class.
don"t forget that these projects are due at the end of this week.
so if any of you need extra time-- - Excuse me, sir. Are you Mr. Gesek?
Yes. - l...
...don"t see Junior Battle in this class.
junior Battle is like a solar eclipse.
we rarely see him, but when we do, it"s always special.
thank you.
surprise arrival to the poll is Richmond High at 1 9th.
top 20, baby. - We"re 1 9th, dog.
the Oilers have posted a perfect 9-0 mark, winning on the road against perennial powerhouses
Xavier and Baxter Union.
junior, you should read the rest of this.
they blowing you up in this paper.
come on, man, read it. - Man, you know he can"t read.
man, shut up. - Shut up, Maddux.
Richmond center has been big as the Oilers are "boyed.
buoyed. The word is "buoyed."
buoyed by Junior Battle"s 19.8-rebound-a-night numbers.
see, that"s my big nigga right there, son. Hey.
lf you was any bigger, you"d be my bigger nigga.
sit down. Sit down!
"nigger" is a derogatory term used to insult our ancestors.
see, if a white man used it, you"d be ready to fight.
your using it teaches him to use it.
you"re saying it"s cool. Well, it"s not cool.
and when you"re around me, l don"t wanna hear that shit.
we clear? - Yes, sir.
Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Worm, what is it you want out of this basketball season?
to win that state championship, sir.
well, who won the state basketball championship last season, Lyle?
hell if l know, sir.
does anybody know?
what"s your father do for a living, Mr. Lyle?
my father"s in jail, sir.
well, l"m sorry to hear that, sir.
but that doesn"t have to be your life.
my point"s this:
l have four seniors on this team,
junior, Lyle, Kenyon and Worm.
all of whom l think can play basketball at the college level.
college.
that"s a viable option for all of you.
but you have to perform in the classroom to have that chance.
you have to have a vision.
tell me, how do you see yourselves?
that reminds me, Mr. Battle.
Mr. Gesek tells me he doesn"t see you in his classroom very often.
Yeah, we cool, though, me and him.
Mr. Gesek is a big basketball fan.
well, as of now, you"re suspended.
Oh, you can practice, but you can"t play until Mr. Gesek tells me you"re caught up in his class.
and that"s a shout out to the rest of you.
you signed a contract.
you made a commitment.
now, l have your schedules and l"ll be getting reports from your teachers.
lf you don"t perform in the classroom, you will not play.
what"s up with that?
sit down, Mr. Battle.
all right, that"s 500 push-ups.
man, this is bullshit! We won those games, not you.
that"s 1000 push-ups for Mr. Battle, Clyde.
you wanna try for 2000?
young man, think about the choice you"re making if you walk out that door.
to the baseline.
all right. How about LaQuisha, if it"s a girl.
LaQuisha? Okay, yeah, the ghetto called and they want they name back.
girl, LaQuisha? Be for real.
you might as well call the baby Food Stamp.
you"re stupid.
all right, l was thinking l could call her Harmony.
l like Harmony. - Harmony, oh, that"s good. l like that.
what did Kenyon say? - Please, he want a boy.
yo, what"s wrong with a girl?
Yeah, dog, boys grow into men, and men ain"t worth the trouble.
don"t you have someplace to go? Something to do?
guess he wants me all to himself.
see you later.
don"t forget, l need your notes for history.
all right, l got you. - Yeah. See you later.
l bought us tickets to the dance.
why you telling these loudmouth girls about the baby?
now everybody"s gonna know.
people are gonna know, Kenyon.
lt"s not people"s business, Kyra. - Why you jumping down my throat?
what"s wrong with you?
look, me and coach been talking, and he thinks l can play college ball.
all right, so?
so how am l gonna do that and raise a baby?
l don"t know. l mean, l"m not saying it won"t be hard.
hard? lt"s already hard.
the kid ain"t even here yet and l"m worried about how l"m gonna feed it, how l"m gonna pay for this and that.
everything.
l"m not ready. - So, what are you saying?
you want out? ls that what you"re saying?
go ahead and say it.
look, if l wanted to be out, l would"ve been out by now, Kyra.
that"s not it at all. l love you.
l wanna be with you.
Yeah, as long as it"s convenient.
l"m thinking about what"s best for us.
you"re not trying to think about what"s best for both of us, you"re thinking about what"s best for you.
you don"t want me to have this baby. You wanna leave Richmond.
you wanna go play college ball. So guess what?
we ain"t got to be ready enough for nothing, all right?
l"m ready enough to do what l gotta do all by my damn self.
so you can take these and go to the dance yourself.
progress reports? You"re the basketball coach.
look, ma"am, we talked about this. l don"t see what the problem is.
do you know what the APl is, Mr. Carter?
no, l don"t.
the Academic Performance lndex.
they judge schools on a scale of one to ten, ten being the best.
do you have any idea where Richmond falls on that scale?
no, ma"am, l have no idea.
we"re a one, Mr. Carter, and have been for the last seven years.
the state rewards schools for their performance.
so every year l have less money to pay faculty and staff.
look, ma"am-- - Can l ask what it is you want?
l want my boys to go to college. - College?
Mr. Carter, Richmond graduates 50 percent of its students, the higher percentage being girls.
now, in my very educated opinion, you have 15 players on your team, you"ll be lucky to graduate five of them.
l"m sorry, ma"am, but l don"t agree with you.
look, these boys signed contracts. Maybe if you"d read one of them.
your job is to win basketball games, Mr. Carter.
l suggest you start doing your job. - And your job is to educate these kids.
l suggest you start doing yours.
well...
...we had another good week.
Yeah, business is very good, Kenny.
but l"m on my own. You"re never here.
lt gets crazy. - Look, l appreciate everything you do.
and l promise you-- We"re closed.
as soon as the season is over, l will be here for you.
l"m-- - Junior Battle"s mother.
Yes, ma"am, l remember you.
how may l help you, ma"am?
Mr. Carter, l got a phone call today from a coach at a junior college in Sacramento.
now, they wanna see Junior play this Friday.
well, that"s great, ma"am, but Junior broke some rules
and l agree with them.
l"m not here to argue with your rules.
l"m not.
almost two years ago now,
Junior"s older brother, Anton, was...killed, and it"s been confusing and hard for me and for Junior.
after you lose a son...every time the phone rings, your heart stops.
now, l"m not asking for special attention.
l agree he needs to get straight with his classes.
but the idea of junior college had never even occurred to my son.
now, l could move to the Hercules school district, and he could play there.
but moving is not gonna solve-- - But l want him to play for you.
look, l"m not gonna stand here and say l know how it feels to lose a son, because l don"t.
and l do appreciate you putting your trust in me.
but l need to hear that from Junior.
he in the car.
go on.
l"m sorry for what l said and did at practice, and l promise to get caught up with my classes, sir.
look me in the eye, sir.
everything inside me tells me if l take you back, l"d be making a mistake and you"ll make a fool of me.
no, sir.
you owe me 1000 push-ups and 1000 suicides before you can play.
l"ll see you at practice tomorrow.
thank you, sir.
quitting basketball like you pay rent.
l don"t know who you think you are.
the next time you make a decision, you better ask me first.
yo, Junior, you did your thing tonight, man.
good looking out, yo. - Yeah, good shot, Junior.
Yeah, no doubt. - Gentlemen, listen up.
l just received a call from the director of the Bayhill Holiday Tournament.
you have been invited.
Yeah! - Yeah, baby!
now, l have more good news.
l spoke to Principal Garrison today.
she informs me that your teachers will have your academic-progress reports prepared by the end of holiday break.
sir, our grades are tight, yo.
yo, not only are our grades all right, coach, but we undefeated, homeboy. - Yeah!
so give it up for the new kings of Richmond, y"all!
yo, we 12-0, y"all, and l just wanna say l wanna see all the beautiful people up at that tournament.
Kyra, what are you thinking? You can"t drink!
you"re pregnant, girl. - Stop.
lt"s soda, all right?
so why don"t you just go back downstairs and find one of your little girlies to freak with.
lt ain"t even like that. Some girl just danced up on me.
that ain"t shit. - Whatever.
you shouldn"t be here. lf you"re serious about this, you need to check this bullshit. Because if not...
lf not, what, Kenyon? You wanna hold my hand through an abortion?
ls that what you want? - l don"t know what l want.
you so damn sure you wanna have this baby, why don"t you tell me how it"s gonna be.
everything"s great, right?
your cousin is 19 with two kids already, Kyra.
lt"s great?
lt was great when we was getting down.
you ain"t having no second thoughts about that.
you loved me when it came to that.
look, Kyra, l can"t tell you what to do, but l look around and l see exactly how l don"t wanna live.
paycheck to paycheck?
dead-end job?
you make it seem like everything"s gonna be all good, like everything"s so wonderful.
you don"t care about me.
you just wanna go to college, play ball and forget about me.
Kyra, that"s not even how it is. - l don"t care what you say.
l"m having this baby. - And then what?
you got everything figured out, right?
so tell me what comes next.
the third and final day of the 22nd Bayhill Tournament finds the host team, Bayhill, trying to win the championship against the surprising Richmond Oilers,
get your hands up!

Richmond uses their last timeout with 1: 20 remaining in the fourth quarter - and Bayhill up by six - Time out!

Hey, number three.
nice game. - Thank you.
okay, cool.
all right, come on. - All right.
watch his door.
yo, yo. Come on, man, let's go.
load up, load up.
Tonya, guess what.
we won the whole thing.
that's right, 1 6-0.
Oh, and here is the best part:
your second-favorite man was MVP.
wait, wait, wait, wait.
l shouldn't tell you that. He should tell you.
l'll wake him up so he can tell you. Hold on.
why don't you try their doorbell with your ghetto self. Move.
can you reach that?
look at this place. - Glad you guys could come.
Oh, you know, we try to be up in here, baby.
yo, what"s up? This is a nice crib.
know what? He must be in somebody else's room.
like l was saying, you know, l"m Junior Battle. l'm the man.
that"s what l"m talking about. - l know.
so you ain't got no boyfriend? - Maybe.
yo!
you looking for your team?
Yes, sir.
Oh, baby. Hard biz. Know what l'm saying?
this is my style right here. l"m amazing. Feel me, Lyle?
Hey, yo, Lyle. Let me get a coochie juice.
l got you, dog. l got you.
yo, Worm! - What up, dog?
Damien! - Yeah?
l'm open!
Damien, are you drunk? - No. l don't drink.
sorry about the thing. - lt's okay.
l see you! - l see you too.
l see her! - Why don't we go swimming.
we're going swimming? - Yeah.
Hey, l'm going swimming!
l'm going swimming!
you're going swimming with the MVP!
MVP!
this water probably cold as hell, shorty. l don't know.
and swimming ain't my cup of tea, baby. Know what l'm saying?
heated. Probably 90 degrees.
we don't have bathing suits. - Right.
neither do we.
Oh, so it's like that?
show me the money, then, know what l'm saying?
Damn! - Since it's like that.
Oh, damn. Yeah, that's nice.
Damn! - You are looking right.
l like that.
you guys coming?
we're getting in there.
l gotta take my chain off so it don't turn green.
Oh, man, l can't believe this.
heaven!
excuse me.
can l help you? - l'm Ken Carter, coach of the Richmond High basketball team.
you're a little lost, aren't you? - Well, l'm looking for my son.
the cab driver told me he dropped the team off here for a party.
excuse me.
Oh, my God, is that--?
Oh, my God, it's Susan's dad.
you see your son?
Yes, sir, l do.
get your ass out of that pool.
Yes, sir.
Richmond High players, let's go!
coach! - Hey, Worm, where did you go?
what up, coach?
l got somebody l want you to meet.
now, l just met her, but she is fine as well.
her name is... - Susan!
Susan. He right! - Oh, shit.
my daughter, Susan.
you are not going to like what happens in practice on Monday.
you think you've run for me before?
l come to your rooms to celebrate with you, and you sneak
l end up taking a road trip to the suburbs, where l find my drunk-ass point guard on top of daddy's little princess!
actually, l was on the bottom, coach. She was on the top.
worm, do you wanna be on this team?
because you're about six words from getting kicked off and kicked off the goddamn bus!
Cruz, open your eyes!
ghetto hoop stars!
signing autographs and humping the honeys!
well, l'm gonna show you what humping is.
coach, we won the tournament.
we undefeated.
l mean, ain't that what you wanted?
winners?
Oh, no.
Oh, no, no, no.
Oh, no!
God--!
you guys are awesome!
what's up, Cruz?
l don' know.
coach giving us a day off, l guess.
yo, l don't even know where the library's even at.
l bet you don't. -...Library's at...?
he don't know where the library's at.
quiet.
quiet!
gentlemen, in this hand, l hold contracts signed by me and signed by you.
ln this hand, l hold academic-progress reports prepared by your teachers.
we have six players failing at least one class, eight players getting incompletes based on attendance.
gentlemen, you have failed to up
no, l'm sorry.
we have failed.
we have failed each other.
now, there are some of you who have upheld this contract.
but know that we are a team.
and until we all meet the terms of this contract, the gym will remain locked.
locked? - What?
what you mean, locked? - What, like for the day?
he must mean for the day. - Mr. Thompson,
Mr. Geek and Miss Sherman have generously volunteered their time to help us reach our goals.
but, coach, l have a 3. 3.
that's good, sir.
do you score all the points for the team too?
we are the Richmond Oilers.
do you know what Oilers stands for?
sir?
know that you're not just walking out on me.
you're walking out on them.
l had to beg you.
and then l ran all those sprints.
l did all that shit.
l killed myself for you, sir, to get back on the team.
this is bullshit.
you put a lock on the gym and forced them to meet you in the library?
are you crazy? - Miss Garrison.
l'm surprised you know where my office is.
take the lock off that gym.
my phone hasn't stopped ringing.
maybe someone on the other end of that phone has a solution to our problem.
your intentions are good, Mr. Carter, but your methods are a bit extreme.
you painted an extreme picture.
no one expects them to graduate, no one expects them to go to college.
so you take away basketball, the one area of their lives - where they have some success? - Yes, ma'am.
and you challenge them academically?
Yes, ma'am. - And what if they fail?
then we've failed.
unfortunately, Mr. Carter, both you and l know that for some of these kids, this basketball season will be the highlight of their lives.
well, l think that's the problem. Don't you?
good morning, Coach Carter. - Good morning.
quite the Pandora's box you've opened.
Oh, l get all the blame now?
let's just say l'm happy to give you all the credit.
l've got every news reporter in town waiting to speak to you.
got a press conference set up around the front of the gymnasium.
coach Carter has taken the lockout to the next level by canceling last night's game.
Richmond forfeited the game, making it their first loss of the season.
and for now, the lock remains on the gym.
here he comes. Here he comes now.
coach Carter! Coach! Can l get a question?
good morning, ladies and gentlemen. l'd like to thank you for your patience.
at this time, l'd like to introduce Coach Ken Carter.
you may direct your questions to him.
Mr. Carter, is it unfair to the players whose grades qualify them to play?
basketball is a team sport, sir.
we support each other on and off the court.
anybody still think coach bluffing now?
l feel like running right up in the middle of all those reporters and telling them l think this is bullshit, son.
maybe you should've gone to class, Lyle.
maybe you should kiss my ass, dog. My grades are fine, homeboy.
lt's Junior they should've locked out. - Maybe Junior will kick your ass out.
why don't you try spelling it, then. - Chill, chill, chill, man. Damn.
junior, if you need help, l'll tutor you. - Man, l don't need your help.
well, he ain't lock us out for no reason.
we been tripping lately, man. All you know it.
how do you think the community's gonna react to this lockout?
l'm not really sure. l hope they'll support these young men.
what, man?
no, man, it's just funny, dog, because, Junior, man, you thought it was bad all us knew your dumb ass was failing science.
now the whole world about to know your dumb ass failing science.
man. - Hey, man.
and you have Fremont this Saturday, the biggest game on your schedule.
now, Richmond is gonna riot if you forfeit that game.
Saturday is a long way off.
we'll see what happens. Thank you all for coming.
that's all the time l have right now. l have to get back to work.
coach, have you talked to any of the parents?
thank you for your time, ladies and gentlemen.
l'd like to remind you that classes are in session, so as you leave campus, please do so quietly.
l ain't turning the cheek.
he come up in my hood, l'm serious, that's all.
young sirs. - lt's always been like that.
lt's been a long day.
Reporters,media everywhere.
let's take this time to say whatever it is we want while the doors are closed.
you have the floor. This is about us.
man, this ain't about us. This is all about Coach Carter.
we're the basketball team.
all l see is you on TV, getting famous, eating that shit up.
ls that all you see? - lts' all l see.
you ain't lying.
well, let me tell you what l see.
l see a system that's designed for you to fail.
now, l know you all like stats, so let me give you some.
Richmond High only graduates 50 percent of its students.
and of those that do graduate, only 6 percent go to college.
which tells us, when we walk down the halls and l look in your classrooms, maybe only one student is going to go to college.
well, damn, Coach Carter, if l ain't going to college, where l'm gonna go?
now, that's a great question.
and the answer for young African-American men in here is this:
probably to prison.
ln this county, 33 percent of black males between 1 8 and 24 get arrested.
so look at the guy on your left.
now look at the guy on your right.
one of you is going to get arrested.
growing up here in Richmond, you're 80 percent more likely to go to prison than college.
those are the numbers.
those are some stats for your ass.
now, l want you to go home...
...and look at your lives tonight...
...and look at your parent's lives...
...and ask yourself, "Do l want better?"
lf the answer is yes, l'll see you here tomorrow.
and l promise you...
...l will do everything in my power to get you to college and to a better life.
l don't understand this. lt's a letter, how can it be a number?
how are balancing those equations coming?
l can't do this. - Hold on. Come on, son.
don't give up yet, son.
here's a story out of California that's getting national attention,
the entire boy's basketball team at Richmond High School has been benched,
the highly ranked Oilers have a perfect season on the court, but some players were in big trouble academically,
and in an unprecedented move, Coach Ken Carter canceled practice, locked the gym and sent his players straight to the library,
now, at the start of the season, l understand you made all of your players sign a contract before they could join the team,
what exactly were the conditions of that contract?
the contract states that the players must maintain a 2, 3 grade point average and that the players must attend all their classes and sit in the front row of those classes,
well, Coach Carter, it's an unusual strategy, and a risky one in a sense, in light of your team's winning record, but l think there's gonna be a lot of people out there pleased to learn that at least somebody still cares about the concept of a student athlete,
thanks a lot for joining us today, l'm sorry to disturb you.
l'm Coach Ken Carter of the Richmond High School basketball team.
Oh, yeah.
l need to ask you a favor.
my team is studying in the library, and l've been trying to tell them that brains and beauty are a perfect combination,
know what l'm saying?
l mean, l'm Worm, baby.
how would you like to watch the Worm work?
Hey, where did you get that backpack?
watch out, too Short.
why study earth science or history or algebra?
getting good grades in those subjects, combined with basketball skills, can get you into college.
girl, you should've bought it. l would've worn it.
you selfish son of a bitch. You snake.
miss-- - No, no, don't "miss" me, snake.
Mr. Carter, you remember me?
now, after all the things that my son has been through for your team, for you to go lock up this gym like this, how dare you,
open up the damn gym!
let the boys play!
what's up, little cousin?
how you doing?
got something for me?
that's what l'm talking about.
Hey, hey. Put it down, man.
you Coach Carter, right? - Yes, sir.
yeah? Check this out, man. - Hey, hold on, man.
Yeah. How you like that? - Oh, hell no.
what? What? - You wanna get out the car?
let's talk about this. - Ain't nothing to talk about.
just open up the gym, man. Let them boys play.
trust me, you don't want me out this car.
Yeah, see? Yeah.
get on! - Don't be no punk.
say what you gotta say.
come on back, punk. - Dad, relax. relax, let it go.
no, l ain't letting nothing go.
these people in Richmond-- Goddamn it!
relax, dad. - Damn it!
relax, relax. Chill out. lt's over. lt's over. All right?
he doesn't mean anything. lt's over.
let it go.
come on, get back in the car. Let's go.
l think you know who she is, but she's got a friend.
l mean, dog... You gotta hook me up.
why l always gotta hook him up? Sound like l'm the Love Connection.
just start a conversation. l'll take care of it.
Yeah. - Yes, girl.
you don't remember me, do you? But, see...
l was just ready to rubbing my hands.
some serious shit. - You should have did it, man.
you talking all that shit, just do it. Know what l'm saying?
you let somebody do that to you. - l let him?
yo, Oscar, man. - What?
don't go nowhere. l'll be right out.
l gotta talk to you. - l already told you...
no. You guys is kind of passing... - l know l'm fine.
but l'm not feeling myself, l'm feeling you.
Hey, l'm gonna holler at my boys across the street for a quick minute.
come on, man. Hurry up, man.
all right. - You know who we are, then?
here they go. - What do we have here?
the Three Stooges from Richmond. - Punk, punk, punk.
Larry, Co and dummy. - Bitches.
dummy and dumb and dumber. l mean, what the hell is the bitchman from Richmond doing on our side of the turf?
you garbage. l can't believe you all won.
shut up, woman. - Don't be
l don't understand how you all won.
you all wack-star niggas. - You all wacked.
wacked.
yo, shut your bitch ass up.
l don't wanna hear you talking shit. - Homey, you a benchwarmer!
get the hell out my face, whitey!
let's do it, homey. Let's do it, homey.
what you trying to do? - He got a gun, man.
you all brought a gun. - Pinole homey. Feel me?
keep it up the block, homey. l'm right here, homey.
l'm right here. Right here.
lt's all good. You all brought a gun!
Pinole!
Bitch-ass...
Pinole, right?

nice to see the fight in you, dog.
know what l'm saying? - Appreciate the backup.
word.
l'm gonna see you all later, all right?
all right, homey. - Good looking.
no doubt.
l'm gonna check you all. - You got this.
this is my paper, man. l'm not playing with you.
then why don't you stop getting in my face.
l can't believe-- He was just standing there.
Renny! - Oh, shit.
come on. Help me. Call 91 1 . - Call 91 1 , man.
yo, l need a phone. l need something...
l just need you to stay with me, okay?
hold his head up.
somebody help me!
Cruz? - l wanna come back, coach.
what's going on? - l wanna come back on the team.
what the hell happened?
they shot him.
Renny. They shot Renny.
l mean, we was just there.
we was just there. Everything was good.
come inside. Come on. - Everything was good, coach.
l mean, you know...
come inside, son.
come on. - You don't understand.
l wanna come back on the team. What do l gotta do to play?
don't worry about that, son. Just come inside.
whatever you want me to do, l'll do it, okay?
okay. Okay.
okay. l got you.
come on. Come on, you're back with us now.
l can't believe they shot him.
just come inside now, all right?
come on. - l just wanna be on the team.
come on. Come on.
whatever you want me to do, l'll do it, okay?
the state only requires a 2. 0 GPA for participation in extracurricular activities.
Yes, ma'am. - And according to your contract, the players are agreeing to maintain a 2. 3?
that, among other things. Yes, ma'am.
other things like...? - Attending all classes, sitting in the front row of those classes, and wearing a tie on game day.
l see. Mr. Carter, does the lockout include practices and games?
and do you have a set period of time?
there will be no basketball, ma'am.
please. Quiet, please.
that includes practices and games, until we as a team reach the agreed-upon GPA.
please, quiet.
please, quiet.
quiet.
thank you, Mr. Carter.
ln the interest of time, l'd like to open this board meeting up for comments.
as a teacher, l was offended when asked by a coach to provide progress reports.
nowhere in my contract does it say that l have to do so.
lt creates more work.
this lockout has brought negative media attention that questions our abilities as educators.
end this madness. End this lockout.
l'm Jason Lyle's uncle.
that boy lives to play ball.
comes to school every day now.
you take away basketball,
God knows what he'd be into.
yesterday, he canceled the Fremont game.
now, that's the biggest game of the year.
l have scouts coming to watch my boy play.
me too. - These boys are 1 6-0.
this whole school, this whole community, is behind this team.
everybody goes to every game.
basketball is the only thing that these boys have got.
are we gonna let Carter come in here and take that away from them?
No! - l don't think so.
not gonna happen.
l'd like to make a motion. - Yes, Mr. Walters?
l move that we remove Mr. Carter as head basketball coach.
order, please. Order.
this board does not have the authority to terminate employment of a staff position.
then l move we end the lockout and let the kids play.
l second the motion.
okay. - lf l may?
Yes, Mr. Carter.
you really need to consider the message that you're sending these boys.
lt's the same message that we as a culture send to our pro athletes, which is that they are above the law.
now, l'm trying to teach these boys the discipline that will inform their lives and give them choices.
lf you endorse the fact that 1 5,1 6and 1 7-year-olds don't have to honor the simple rules of a basketball contract, how long do you think it'll be before they're out there breaking laws?
now, l played basketball at Richmond 30 years ago.
lt was the same thing then.
some of my teammates ended up in prison.
some of them ended up dead.
l took this job because l wanted to effect change in a special group of young men, and this is the only way l know how to do that.
lf you vote to end the lockout, you won't have to terminate me. l'll quit.
good.
thank you, Mr. Carter.
the board now recognizes five voting members.
ln this instance, we will be accepting the vote of Principal Garrison as well.
now, l put to those members the vote on whether or not to end the lockout.
all those in favor of ending the lockout will raise their right hand when called upon.
l will vote first by not raising my hand.
principal Garrison?
parent rep, Mr. Cepeda.
and Ms. Nyugen.
Yes. - Thank you.
the lockout ends with a vote of 4 to 2.
lf there's no other business, this board meeting is adjourned.
thank you all for coming.
Mr. Carter.
are you sure you wanna do this?
look, l know we haven't always seen eye to eye, but you've done such a great job with these boys, it seems wrong to just
look. No offense, ma'am, but all the work l did with those boys was negated when they ended the lockout.
l don't think that's true, l
the board sent the message loud and clear.
winning basketball games is more important than graduating from high school and going to college.
l'm sorry, l just can't support that message.
sir, they can cut the chain off the door, but they can't make us play.
we've decided we're gonna finish what you started, sir.
Yeah, so leave us be, coach.
we got shit to do, sir.
our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate.
our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure.
lt is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us.
your playing small does not serve the world.
there is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you.
we were all meant to shine, as children do.
lt's not just in some of us, it's in everyone.
and as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same.
as we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.
sir, l just wanna say thank you.
you saved my life.
thank you, sirs.
all of you.
academic-progress reports, young men.
these things are...
...unbelievable.
l know you've been trying.
l guess there's only one way to say this.
gentlemen, we've reached our goal. Let's play ball.
rich what? Richmond!
rich what? Richmond!
hustle back. Get back, get back.
set it, Worm. Set it.
watch baseline.
take it. - Take it, come on.
Yes! - Find a man. Find a man.
swing it, swing it.
go, go, go.
go, go.
come on!
go Richmond!
hold the ball, hold the ball!
see you!
great game, coach. - Good game.
Richmond returns from their lockout and keeps their streak alive at 1 7 games,
a team that won only four games last year is now a Cinderella team that has to be thinking that there's a chance of getting the phone call to come to the dance, is Richmond headed for the state tournament?
so, what else you all gonna do at the park when you go?
seesaw. - Seesaw?
you're gonna seesaw? - Yeah.
who's gonna push you? - My mommy is gonna push me.
yeah?
that's good. l wish l could go with you.
come on, baby. - But l'll see you later, okay?
Bye. - Bye.
how you been?
good.
you look good.
thank you. So do you.
considering.
you know, everything has been crazy, with the lockout.
Yeah, it'll be all right.
for sure.
can we sit down somewhere?
l've been trying to get my head straight about things.
a lot of things. Especially us.
Kenny, l-- - Kyra, just listen.
please.
for a long time, it's just been my moms, my boys and you.
and that's what l counted on.
l'm trying to count on myself now, and l'm all right and shit, it's just, without you, nothing good feels as good.
lt's like l'm missing some happy part of me.
l got you something.
and it ain't from the 99 Cent Store.
shut up.
they gave you a scholarship? - Yeah, baby, a full ride.
Oh, my gosh. That is crazy.
Oh, my gosh.
l know you gonna kill it up there.
no, we gonna kill it up there.
l told them about you and the baby. They wanna help us.
...there is no more baby.
l decided not to go through with it.
l had a choice to make, so l made it.
for me, Kenny.
well, when...?
why didn't you tell me? l would have gone with you.
l'm so sorry.
Kyra, l'm so sorry you had to go through that by yourself.
my mom went with me.
but l think that...
l think you should go to school and play ball and do your thing.
you know?
l want that for you. And that's real.
l think you should be all you can.
l want you to come with me.
Kyra, l love you.
l want you to come with me.
you serious? - l'm serious.
Oh, my God. - l love you.
l love you too.
l understand, sir.
all right. Thank you, sir.
we're in.
that's what l'm talking about.
guys, guys, guys. Now, listen.
lt's not gonna be easy. lt's gonna be a long road.
we're a really low seed. - Who did we get, coach?
coach, they ranked number one in the state.
Hey, yo, Junior, man, don't worry about Ty Crane, dog. You'll get him.
we got this. That's all right, baby. One game at a time. We got this.
all right, guys. - lt's on.
bring your A game, young man. - Yes, sir.
welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the first round of the ClF playoffs,
St, Francis is one of the best high school teams in the nation, with Ty Crane believed to be a shoo-in for the top NBA draft pick next year,
on the other side of the court is Richmond, a team that's had a media-worthy season as well,
Richmond High has never played in a state tournament,
let's go. Let's go, let's go.

gentlemen, you told me you deserved to be here.
well, you're not playing like it.
all season long, we played our game.
right now, you're playing theirs.
when we step on the floor, every second that clock is ticking, we are pedal to the metal.
we run the ball. We pressure the ball.
and most importantly, we control the tempo of the game!
we make them play Richmond Oiler ball.
worm, you can take this kid.
force him left, and when he crosses over, you jump him. Damien, push the tempo.
kenyon, Lyle, crash the boards.
Cruz, when you're in the game in transition, take that jumper you love.
junior, just keep doing what you're doing.
hold on to that monster.
you do those things, gentlemen, and l guarantee you, at the end of the game, we will be there.
all right, hands in.
game time. - All right, take control of this game.
who's gonna win this game?
one, two, three, Richmond! Let's go. Let's do this.

let's go, let's go.
all right, baby, it's all us now. lt's all us. Let's go.
they're standing on the edge of a cliff. All we gotta do is push them off.
we're gonna run Candy.
worm, you gotta sell them the pass to Damien.
junior, we come to you on the weak-side seal.
but, gentlemen, just because you deserve this doesn't mean they're gonna give it to you.
sometimes you gotta take what's yours. You ready to do this?
hell, yeah. - Let's go.
all right, hands in. - Come on, take this.
Richmond on three. One, two, three, Richmond!
careful of the foul, all right? Let's go. - l got you. 1 -4, 1 -4!

hold on, hold on. Let me down, let me down. Battle, Battle! Battle!
you're real, man. l mean that. All right?
all right? Keep your head up, baby.
well, not quite your storybook ending, huh?
not for us, anyway.
but you men played like champions.
you never gave up.
and champions hold their heads high.
what you achieved goes way beyond the win-loss column or what's gonna be written on the front page of the sports section tomorrow.
you've achieved something that some people spend their whole lives trying to find.
what you achieved is that ever-elusive victory within.
and, gentlemen...
...l am so proud of you.
four months ago, when l took the job at Richmond, l had a plan.
that plan failed.
l came to coach basketball players, and you became students.
l came to teach boys...
...and you became men.
and for that, l thank you.
lf someone walked in this door right now and offered me the coaching job at any school in the state of California, you know which team l'd choose?
l'm just saying, man.
Richmond? - Rich what?
Richmond. - Rich what?
rich what? - Richmond.
where we from? - Richmond!
what's my hometown? - Richmond!
what do we love? - Richmond!
rich what? - Richmond!
stories of time before man and gods, when Titans ruled the earth.
the Titans were powerful,
but their reign was ended by their own sons: Zeus, Poseidon and Hades.
Zeus convinced his brother Hades to create a beast so strong it could defeat their parents.
and from his own flesh,
Hades gave birth to an unspeakable horror, the Kraken.
Zeus became king of the heavens.
poseidon, king of the seas.
and Hades, tricked by Zeus,
was left to rule the underworld in darkness and in misery.
it was Zeus who created man,
and man's prayers fed the gods' immortality.
but in time, mankind grew restless.
they began to question the gods,
and, finally, rise up against them.
into this world, a child was born.
a boy who would change everything.
Shh. Shh.
Perseus.
what is it, son?
I'll have a brother or a sister soon.
you think we're gonna love this child differently to the way we love you? We won't.
this child will be yours.
me...
I'm no one's son.
I am your father, Perseus. Marmara is your mother.
and you'll always be our son.
the bond between us is much more than flesh and bone.
the love we have for you,
it's that love that gods and kings fight over.
I've never understood the gods.
but even I don't question that you were saved for a reason.
and some day,
that reason is gonna take you far away from here.
but not tonight, eh?
Perseus. Perseus!
getting frail, old man.
Marmara! Marmara!
another day, nothing.
caught on the reef.
to whom do I direct our gratitude for this glorious bounty?
Spyros, please.
poseidon, Zeus? Who do I thank, Marmara?
thank the men who provoke them. - They crush my island.
they put a plague on yours.
they take from us what they want. We're their slaves.
the gods gave us life.
for that, we should be thankful. - I'm tired of being thankful for scraps.
I'm a fisherman. Perseus is a fisherman.
they've even taken that away from us. What we are.
still they want us to love them anyway.
one day, somebody's gonna have to make a stand.
one day, somebody's gonna have to say "Enough."
just like the day you came to me.
the storm brought me right to you.
I know you have questions, son.
I wish I had the answers.
I have everything I need,
right here.
good night, son.
hold her steady!
Tekla, the wreath.
fetch the wreath.
the statue of Zeus. Magnificent.
something isn't right.
the soldiers, what are they doing?
come on!
lift it!
hang on!
in the name of the king and queen!
who are they?
soldiers from Argos.
what have they done?
they've declared war, a war against the gods.
let's turn the boat around. - No.
do nothing.
behind you!
hold on!
Tekla.
Where's the boy?
Tekla!
No!
go! - No!
No!
Zeus, you must bring an end to this. They attack our temples!
now they dare to desecrate Zeus' image.
we could reach out to them.
an accommodation could be made. A truce!
No!
I created them...
and they reward my love with defiance?
there will be no truce.
finally.
some rage from you.
how long has it been?
how long, brother,
since you've seen my face?
Hades.
endless years, I've watched from the underworld...
and saw your wrath tempered with love.
you created them for one reason,
so their prayers would fuel our immortality.
but you love them too well.
they've grown strong.
and now I am forced to rise because we are all threatened.
what do you want, brother?
let me loose upon them.
they will pray again,
and you will bathe in their awe and fear.
and we will grow strong again.
he belongs in the underworld, not here.
you do not tell me where I belong.
you say it is love that feeds us.
but you depend on their love.
I've only learned to live on their fear and their pain.
Zeus, our brother speaks the truth. Hear him.
go. Do what you will.
father, we need the mortals.
no, Apollo.
Hades is right.
their insolence has a price.
like children, they need to be reminded of the order of things.
set an example, brother.
turn them on each other...
and back into our arms.
are we the last boat to come in? - No, captain.
you're the only one.
is he one of ours?
no. We found him off Paxos amongst our dead.
he was the only survivor.
let the palace figure out what to do with him.
squad by four!
go on.
because if we show the gods our love,
they shall show us love in return. They shall.
they gave us the corn in the fields, the sun in the sky.
these are all gifts given to us.
gifts can be taken away. This will be taken away if we do not pay love to our gods.
if we do not, we stay in filth and misery, which we have brought upon ourselves.
move. Out of the way. - Our gods, we beg for the whip,
the beauty and clarity of servitude.
man cannot rule man. You defy the gods and you will be punished.
is this all there is?
we lost many men, Your Majesty,
but we have victory.
to King Kepheus! To Queen Cassiopeia!
no.
to you,
our mighty legion.
our heroes who have dared to strike a blow at the heart of Zeus!
the temples are burning.
the statues have fallen.
we have starved them of our prayers.
tonight,
after a generation of struggle,
the sun does not set over the ocean.
it sets on Olympus itself.
a new era has begun.
the era of man!
that frown doesn't suit you, Andromeda.
have something to drink. You'll feel more lively.
Andromeda.
what's your name?
Perseus.
take this.
please drink.
hands off. - Enough.
our daughter, the missionary.
have you seen what's happening out there?
have you even bothered to look?
we serve as an inspiration.
hundreds of our men have lost their lives,
yet we celebrate.
you provoke the gods and you act as if there will be no consequence.
well, what do you want? Should we be afraid?
should we be trembling and soiling ourselves in fear?
the gods need us.
they need our worship.
what do we need of them?
look at my daughter. - Don't.
what could be more divine than her face?
more beautiful than all the women of Greece.
more beautiful than Aphrodite herself. The Olympians should envy her.
we are the gods now. - My queen. You're making a spectacle.
interesting.
you!
you are specks of dust beneath our fingernails.
your very breath is a gift from Olympus.
you have insulted powers beyond your comprehension.
who are you?
I am Hades.
kneel.
not now, Perseus.
you will have your chance.
what do you know of beauty?
what is more beautiful than death?
gaze upon me, mortal queen.
mother. - Princess.
in 10 days,
when the sun is eclipsed,
I will unleash the Kraken.
Argos will be swept from the earth,
and all of you with it.
unless...
you sacrifice the princess.
you so foolishly compare to the gods.
only her blood will sate the Kraken and Zeus
who you have so offended.
choose your penance, Argos.
destruction or sacrifice.
this is the will of Zeus.
the will of your father.
there is a demigod in Argos.
that is impossible.
he's yours.
his name is Perseus.
we could offer him sanctuary.
have I heard his prayers?
this son knows no love for me.
he's no different from any of the others who have turned their backs on us.
for the last time, demigod, speak!
I'm not a demigod. - Who are you? Why were you sent?
I don't know.
I advise against this, sire.
he's not to be trusted. - What would you have me do? Draco.
leave him.
is it possible?
if it's true you are the son of Zeus,
you can save us.
you must save us.
I can't save you. I'm just a man.
my lord, as terrible as it is to utter the words,
a sacrifice is the only way.
don't even say the word.
he's right.
no one should have to die for me.
let Perseus go.
sire, we need to get the princess out of the city now.
I'll find a place to hide her. - You can't hide from Hades.
so says the bastard son of a god.
my father was killed by a god.
my mother, sister, and everyone I loved was killed by a god.
I mend nets,
not wield a sword.
so, demigod, you have a visitor.
she says she knows you.
my name is Io, Perseus.
and how do you know me?
I've watched you all your life.
I guided you to your family.
are you a god?
there are gods and there are men...
and there are those of us who are in between.
many years ago,
I refused a god's advance.
I was cursed with agelessness.
that's not much of a curse.
I've lived for years watching my loved ones die.
I imagine you're sympathetic to that plight.
is it true?
am I the son of Zeus?
Yes.
the story of your birth began with the rebellion of King Acrisius.
mankind had grown tired of the gods' mistreatment and cruelty.
Acrisius led a siege on Olympus.
it is said the other gods...
wanted to simply lay waste to Acrisius and his army...
but Zeus loved man too much.
instead, he chose to make an example of Acrisius.
he disguised himself as the king...
and visited the chamber where the king's wife was sleeping.
my king.
Zeus?
Acrisius grew mad with rage.
he ordered the execution of his wife and Zeus' newborn son.
I curse you, Zeus.
I deny you the body you soiled
and the bastard child with it!
No!
the queen and her child were cast into the sea.
your mother was killed, but you,
part man, part god, you lived.
I've watched over you ever since,
waiting for the day when you will help bring an end to the tyranny of the gods.
you were born to kill the Kraken.
I don't know why I was born
or what I am.
but I know it's not the Kraken I wanna kill.
how do I get to Hades?
if the Kraken falls,
Hades will be weak enough for you to strike a deathly blow.
only then will you have the revenge you seek.
then they better release me.
if the Kraken can be killed,
the Stygian witches will know how.
the witches are further away than the legion has ever been.
no man can go there.
no man.
keep your distance, Io.
Zeus, forgive us for these affronts and protect us.
and you still believe they're going to help?
this is suicide.
and the shields. Come on, boys.
it's a lost cause.
we've no chance, and you know it.
here's who you drew into this, Perseus. An honor guard.
young men who look good on a reviewing stand,
and old soldiers, heading towards retirement.
do you know what the Kraken is?
the Kraken is the end of us. A colossal, elemental beast.
it doesn't think. It doesn't feel. Even the gods fear it.
and you, you're going to kill it? - Don't come.
I don't need your help. - Of course not.
you're the son of Zeus.
but we have orders. - Come, we need to leave!
gentlemen, may our journey be long, filled with agony and torment,
and may we all complain about it bitterly as old men.
so what should we bring? - Bring everything.
what makes you think the witches will tell us anything?
Oh, they'll tell us, or I'll kill them too.
come on. Let's go, boys.
what is this? - Just leave it.
don't leave us to the mercy of the gods! Please.
don't go. Please stay!
stay here. Please? Please? Help us.
you're just going to make the gods angrier. Please.
just sacrifice the princess!
watch your mouth! Stay back. Stay back!
you'd think they might be thankful.
you cannot desert us!
maybe they're tired of being thankful.
good news!
my brother and I have decided to accompany you on your journey.
- We have enough strangers here.
we can be of great help to you, trust me. You'll need us.
I need soldiers, not hunters.
which one of your soldiers knows how to cut the impenetrable skin of the Nemean lion?
which one of them knows the soft points on a centaur's armor?
which one of them knows which jugular to slice on a five-headed Hydra?
the middle one. - The middle one. Good guess.
my brother and I, we know how to kill.
we enjoy it. - If you can keep up,
and you don't mind dying, come along.
it is death who should be afraid of us.
king Acrisius.
there is no Acrisius.
just Calibos.
we have an enemy in common.
Zeus. - Zeus.
my brother.
what do you want from me?
Zeus' seed in your wife survived.
the child of your shame.
Perseus.
he lives?
you murdered your wife for nothing.
now Perseus hurls himself from Argos to destroy me.
he must die.
what would you have me do? - Zeus must think I serve him,
but I am growing stronger.
until I possess my full power,
you will be my weapon.
come.
use this.
kill Perseus for me.
and I'll destroy Zeus for you.
I serve you.
the boy will die.
how far is it?
four days to the witches.
four days? I'm tired already.
here, use this.
would you like us to wait?
Oops.
you really are a fisherman.
you should've seen my father.
you.
bring your weapon.
have you handled a sword before?
there's been no need. - I see.
left foot forward.
your motions should be fluid.
the weapon is a part of you.
like the sting on a wasp.
stay focused.
know what's around you.
keep your balance at all times.
you fall...
you die.
get up.
don't...
there is a god in you.
be sure to bring it.
end of lesson.
Perseus.
a gift from the gods.
forged on Olympus. - Why?
just accept it.
I can do this as a man.
so it's yours.
gentlemen, retrieve our savior.
Shh.
the Pegasus.
no man has ever ridden one.
it's a message.
they're watching us.
Perseus!
Perseus!
Perseus!
why does it always have to be...? - Shh!
listen.
help me!
help me!
you reek of your father.
who was that? - I don't know. Let's ask him.
let it go.
no. We split up.
just follow the blood.
come on!
look! His blood.
are you happy now?
attack!
wait! Wait!
what is that?
come on!
Lxas!
spear!
Draco!
faster!
let's go, let's go!
go, jump!
run!
back up! Back up! Back up! - here's more!
run! - Everyone. Back to back!
stand your ground.
three more! In the name of the gods, they're bigger.
what are they?
djinn.
I fought them in the legion.
this is their desert.
enemies? - I thought so.
they aren't human. Not anymore. Desert conjurers, cutthroats.
well, somebody should thank them. - What?
what is it? - Venom. From Hades.
pray. Pray to Zeus for strength. - No. No.
pray to your damn father.
hear my prayer. Protect and heal your son.
no. - Please, Zeus, hear me.
would you like some bread?
thank you. - Thank you.
please. - Have some bread.
over here. Over here.
for you. - Please.
no.
we must turn our hearts to Hades!
it is the only way!
brothers and sisters!
come to me! Come!
I have the way out of our misery.
Hades has asked for the princess.
sacrifice one for the life of the city.
why do they remain silent while we suffer?
why do they guard the woman whose death will save us?
is she better than any one of you?
we have long worshiped Zeus in Argos.
but it is Hades who now offers us salvation.
we must pray to the one who showed us our sin
and who offers us redemption through blood.
a bribe for the ferryman.
when they get injured in battle,
they replace their limbs with charwood and black magic.
they feel no pain.
live hundreds of years.
so how old is that one?
I don't care. I don't trust them.
you're burning.
drink this.
I'll get more water.
come on!
look out!
what?
what's he saying?
the Djinn have waited many years for the one who will free them from the gods.
he says he is no friend of the humans. - You don't say.
but the only way we can help Perseus is together.
Draco.
look.
together.
he's not ready to travel yet. - Time is slipping away, Io.
he may be a demigod, but he's still mortal. - Feeling better?
Yeah, a bit. - Good.
your pride is killing my men.
you were given gifts. Use them. - Those gifts are a trap!
I don't care what they are. Use them. - No.
I will not use that sword or anything that they give me!
so we'll just continue to die.
I can't become like them.
if I do this, I do it as a man.
but you are not just a man.
I choose to be.
a man cannot do this, Perseus.
according to who?
the gods?
if I had your gifts...
when you need your sword, it's in my bag.
they're riding them.
they tried to kill us. I'm not getting on it.
magnificent.
what are you waiting for?
well, we need to make up for lost time.
we're making good time.
not good enough. The eclipse is drawing near.
how close are we to the Norn Mountains?
it'll be two days before we reach the witches.
this thing is making me feel sick.
trust me, it's better to be on one than in one.
what, don't you ever smile?
when I spit in the eyes of the gods,
then I'll smile.
what is this place? - The Garden of Stygia.
this is where the Kraken defeated the Titans.
it's what Argos will look like when we fail.
every step we take is an insult to the gods.
good. - Perseus.
only ask what you need to know. Nothing more.
of course.
visitors.
who is it? - Visitors.
got the eye.
give it to me. - Who is it?
who is it? Who is it?
the eye. Give it to me.
Perseus, no.
we didn't come here to fight.
we just have one question. - Young Perseus.
son of Zeus. - So fresh.
Perseus. - Closer.
a little nibble.
flesh of a god. - Flesh of a god.
witch. - Don't. Easy.
stale meat, ladies.
so which one's gonna answer my question?
you want to know about the Kraken. - Kraken?
do it. - Kill it.
that's right. - A wasted journey.
the Kraken fears no weapon.
it must have a weakness.
maybe.
but knowledge demands payment.
sacrifice. - Sacrifice.
Eusebios! - Watch out!
look out! - Lxas, shoot!
help! - The eye!
let him go! Do it! - You wouldn't dare!
we cannot see the answers without the eye!
let him go!
now answer the question.
how do we kill the Kraken?
there is a solution. - Solution.
but it is an impossible one.
yeah? - The Gorgon, Medusa.
Medusa.
anything of flesh is killed by her gaze.
killed by her. - Her prison lies across the River Styx at the edge of the underworld. - A Titan against a Titan.
she's no use against the Kraken. We can't control her.
then we take her head.
clever boy. - Now the eye. Give us the eye.
the eye. - The eye.
where is it?
but wait. There's more. Don't you want to know more?
Perseus, no.
tell him. - Tell him.
what?
your journey does not end well.
fate has spoken.
you will die, son of Zeus!
it's a lie. Come.
written as history.
Perseus.
you will die.
why are the Djinn leaving us?
they believe we will all die. It's the prophecy.
who are you?
well, you can call me "Father" if you wish.
my father's dead.
he was killed by a god.
an unfortunate casualty in a war men brought on themselves.
men didn't murder my family. Your brother did.
you heard the witches' prophesy.
you will not defeat the Kraken, much less Hades.
if you continue this journey, you will die, and Argos will still fall.
if you're so sure, why are you here?
to offer you sanctuary.
your blood is mine, Perseus, and that makes you a god.
it's time you came to Olympus and started living like one.
rather die in the mud with those men than live forever as a god.
you foolish boy.
man's entire existence is a gift of my grace.
for someone who created man,
you don't know much about us.
we live,
we fight and we die for each other, not for you.
tell Hades I'll see him soon.
I will not make this offer again. - Good.
because I'd hate to refuse you twice.
Perseus.
wait.
it's expensive where you're going.
Kucuk fashioned this shield from the Scorpioch.
stronger and lighter than any metal.
very rare and high-quality item.
we can fight anywhere,
but not in the underworld.
Yeah.
good luck, fisherman.
we all heard what the witches said.
but we can prove them wrong.
I need your help.
it wasn't the gods that saved me up there.
if you believe that we have a chance.
I never liked Argos much anyway.
I know the way.
then we go to the underworld. We kill Medusa.
now what? - We wait for Charon.
charon only ferries the dead.
any volunteers?
heads we swim.
a bribe for the ferryman.
so, what happens when we get there?
just another beast to kill.
a beast?
Medusa was beautiful once.
so beautiful as to tempt Poseidon.
when he came for her...
she ran to Athena's temple thinking that the goddess would protect her.
she didn't.
Poseidon took her on the cold floor.
she prayed to Athena for comfort.,
but the goddess felt nothing but disgust.
she made sure no one would ever want Medusa again.
one look at the creature she has become will turn any living thing to stone.
I cannot assist you there. A curse prevents me.
it was Athena's one bit of solace to Medusa so that Medusa would never harm a woman.
only men are allowed in the temple.
though no man has ever made it out.
Medusa's got a tail and that's how she'll use it.
listen.
hear her muscles coil.
smell her skin.
feel her hunger in your gut.
Medusa's killed you twice now.
do you think she'll hand you her head? She won't be gracious about it.
one look in her eyes and you'll turn to stone.
good.
try not to enjoy this so much. - I'm trying to help you live.
don't look at me.
ease your storm.
we're nearing Medusa's lair.
I never thought I could reach this place.
who'd you lose?
my daughter.
taken away on her 16th birthday.
dragged down here.
I have a feeling I'll see her soon.
you brought us this far. Let's go the rest of the way.
how many coins did you get, Perseus? - Just the one.
I only knew one great man in my life.
my father.
now I know four more.
and a woman.
and whatever the hell you are.
I know we're all afraid.
but my father told me:
someday someone was gonna have to take a stand.
someday someone was gonna have to say, "Enough."
this could be that day.
trust your senses.
and don't look this bitch in the eye.
doesn't really inspire confidence. - Quiet.
listen. - Eusebios.
keep your eyes down.
here we go.
Solon!
keep going!
flank her.
Draco. - Go!
Eusebios, follow me.
hang on!
Eusebios.
remember what Perseus said.
eyes down.
Lxas, no.
eyes down.
where are you?
where are you?
Eusebios.
go!
wait here.
I'll lure her out.
get ready.
now!
together.
let them know men did this.
just you and me, son of Zeus.
Perseus.
don't become one of them.
io, I'm here.
there's no time.
the eclipse.
Perseus, you must go before it's too late.
I'm not going anywhere.
my fate is certain.
but the fate of Argos is still in your hands.
all my life you've been there.
you never left me.
I can't leave you.
this part of the journey you must do alone.
Perseus,
you're not just part man, part god,
but you're the best of both.
everything will be all right.
brother.
it is time for the mortals to pay.
my child waits to do your will.
leave us.
release the Kraken!
the Kraken comes now!
our suffering ends when the beast is sated!
will it take us...
or will it take Andromeda?
Andromeda!
it's my name they're calling.
this cannot continue.
stay back! - Stay back!
look! The Kraken! Help us!
Andromeda!
hades, we sacrifice our princess in your name.
it comes, brothers and sisters!
Argos has fallen.
do you feel stronger, brother?
you thought the Kraken would bring you their prayers.
but the Kraken is my child. It feeds only me.
I command Olympus. Remember who you serve.
I serve myself.
I have since you cheated me.
you sent me to the underworld to be hated...
while you basked in their love.
we need the love of humans.
no, you need it.
I survive on their fear.
your reign is over, brother Zeus.
you'll watch while my blessed avenger devours their hopes.
and then finally you'll know my pain.
there is still a demigod in Argos, brother,
Perseus.
the bag! Come on!
Hyah!
Hey, fisherman!
come on!
No!
I'm a god.
I will live forever.
but not here.
the boats are coming for us.
for you. Not for me.
you won't stay, will you?
Perseus, Argos needs a ruler.
I cannot be a king.
I serve you better as a man.
you'll make a fine queen for them.
olympus owes you a debt of gratitude.
as do I.
Hades lives.
he's just sent back to the underworld.
biding his time, no doubt.
waiting for men to grow weak, and in their weakness, he grows stronger.
it's mankind who holds the key to Hades' rise.
it always was.
so we'll see him again.
Yes.
but now the world knows a man can stop him.
of course, you had some help.
a sword, the Pegasus...
I wanted men to worship us again, but I didn't want it to cost me a son.
that's almost human of you.
I don't suppose you'll reconsider my offer to take your place as one of us.
I've got everything I need right here.
you may not want to be a god, Perseus.
but after feats like yours, men will worship you.
be good to them.
be better than we were.
and if you insist on continuing this mundane human existence,
I won't have you do it alone.
you're the son of Zeus, after all.
Hey. - Hey.
is this yours? - Dad.
didn't think so.
Hey.
Hey, I was gonna do that for you later.
now you won't have to.
OK. OK, are you hungry? - Yeah.
cereal? - OK.
all right.
so the plan... - [girl] The plan.
Cara, Dad's about to reveal the plan.
I'll pack up the car, pick you up right after school, and then we'll drive straight... through.
[Girl 2] Sounds good. - Does not.
what now? - Well, isn't the whole point that we go to school? You're forcing us to miss school when we should be, like, in school.
right? I mean, what about my studies?
OK, why are you smiling?
I just never thought I'd hear you say, "What about my studies?
it makes me, like, smile.
[Scoffs] I don't wanna go. - We do this every year.
only time we can get the family together.
[Girl] Gotta help Grandma and Grandpa.
go. - You're destroying my education.
change. - [Doorbell rings]
yes? - Very good column, sir.
that bit about curfews? Very apt.
and may I also say that yesterday's column on boundary setting was excellent.
who are you? - I'm Marty Barasco.
I would like to thank you for last Friday's column.
it helped me understand my parents.
[Laughs] OK.
well, Marty, what else can I do for you?
I'd like to see your daughter, sir. If I could.
Ah. Jane. Jane!
actually, I'm here for Cara.
nice to meet you, Marty. Come back in two years.
I don't wanna brag, but Mr. Shaff says
I'm one of the best drivers in his class. He says I'm highway ready.
Mr. Shaff and I may not agree.
Cara! Let's go. - So will you let me?
we'll see. 3pm sharp. Do not be...
late. We got it. ...late.
Yes, we do.
FYI, that boy you were really rude to before is my friend, Marty, my lab partner from class. We're doing an extra-credit project together.
bus.
whoa, whoa, whoa! Wait! Wait, wait, wait!
come on! - Hurry up!
yeah?
Yeah, Jordy, I e-mailed it half an hour ago.
what?
no way. You're kidding.
that's funny. [laughs]
Where's your sister? - You're late.
she went to Yumms. Can I drive?
dad's going to be syndicated. - Not so fast.
there're others being considered...
Aw, that's great. Can I drive?
look. You're a fine driver. It's the just the other hundred million dr...
if you don't let me, I'll never learn.
but if I let you, you may not live.
what was that? What are you doing?
could you be more embarrassing? - Sorry to interrupt your studies.
well, we can't all be monks like you. No.
by the way, you're grounded. - Oh, I'm grounded?
Mm-hmm. For how long?
for life. - [Girl] Dad, come on.
it's humiliating. - Tell me about it.
[Dan] Grounded for a month.
a month! But that's worse than forever.
OK, Dad, why? - You lied to me.
Yeah, well, you can't handle the truth.
try me next time.
[Stammering] But... but... - No, no. No. No.
OK, Dad. I... I love Marty. - Oh, please.
[Cara] OK. - Come on.
dad, Dad. Dad, Dad, stop. OK, just listen. Listen.
I didn't know right away. It took me a while.
what's a while? - I've known him for three weeks, but I knew in three days.
you can't know in three days. - [Car engine turning over]
well, maybe she can. - No, no. No.
what you're feeling is not love.
it is young and reckless. - Yes, it is. I love him.
you may think it's love, it is not! - No, I love him. I love him.
no, it's not. No, it's not. - I love him.
I love him. I love him.
dad? You OK?
[Dan] There goes Jane's college education.
there goes Cara's.
Oh, no. What about mine? - No, you're good.
Ah, no, wait. There it goes.
you can't keep me from Marty.
dad, let me remind you that guys are half the world, and I'll find others.
but know that only Marty gets my heart.
in the car.
I know a really good driver. - No.
no.
here you go.
I think your sisters aren't very happy with me.
Duh. - Why do you think?
you're a good father, but sometimes a bad dad.
who told you to say that? - No one.
was it Jane or Cara? You can tell me.
I made it up myself. - No. You didn't.
which one of your sisters told you to say that?
I made it up myself. I'm in the fourth grade.
I can make things up for myself. - Jane or Cara?
I made it up myself. - Jane or Cara?
I'm in the fourth grade. - She's in the fourth grade!
[Horn honks] - [Woman] Oh, they're here.
[Indistinct chatter] - [Woman 2] They're here. Come, girls.
Hey, Poppy. - Good to see you.
Hi, Lil.
Hey, Dad.
well, now we're all here. - Mm-hm.
how you doing? - Uh, fine. Or maybe not.
my kids can't stand me. - Means you're doing something right.
Oh, you're so... Hiya, honey.
look at your girls. They're all grown up.
no, no, no. They're still very young.
come on, Lilly. Lilly. - Hey, how are you?
she's getting big. - Getting bigger every day.
Hey, man. - Dan the man.
good to see you.
hello. - Hello.
Hi, Uncle Dan. - Hey, Eileen, how are you?
did you hit traffic? - Yeah, it wasn't... eh, not too bad.
Hi, sis. Good to see you. - Glad you're here.
who are they? I've never seen these guys in my life.
Hi, Uncle Dan. - Say something.
something. - It happened. I knew it. Way to go.
sounds good. - Help your uncle with his bags, OK?
honey, you're down here.
your brother, Mitch, has a friend coming to visit, so...
I'm in the special room. - Yeah.
[Mitch] Sorry, bro. - That's OK.
you sleep tight. - You too.
you tired? - [Girl] Get down, get down!
morning. - Good morning.
sleep OK? - Yeah.
[Girl] Get down! - Can I get you guys something?
get a life.
she just needs some space. - That's not what she needs.
Yeah. She does.
from the sound of things, you all do.
Yeah, why don't you go get the papers?
Oh, Mom. - Yeah, go on.
it would do you good. Get lost for a little while.
maybe I should stick around. - No. Get lost, Danny.
it's not a request.
good morning. - Good morning.
good morning. - I'll be with you in a minute.
Oh.
well, then he went downtown.
Yeah. For coffee. Right.
talks to him on weekends.
Hi. Excuse me. Could you help?
um... Yes.
I'm looking for a book, obviously.
anything in particular? - Yeah, something that can help me deal with, um...
...what might be an awkward situation.
Oh. OK. Um, what... what's kind of, um...
well, something funny might be nice.
but not necessarily big, "ha ha ha," laugh-out-loud funny, you know, and certainly not make-fun-of-other-people funny, but rather something, uh, human funny.
OK.
and, uh, if it could, um, sneak up on you, surprise you, and at the same time make you think that what you thought was not only right in a wrong kind of way, but when you're wrong, there's a certain rightness - to your wrongness. - Um...
well, maybe what I mean is, um, more importantly, I'm looking to be swept up. [laughs]
and at the same time, not.
meaning I wanna feel, uh, a deep connection to, uh, something.
or maybe I don't know what I'm looking for.
well, in my experience, you rarely find it all in just one book.
Oh. - Maybe that's why there're so many.
hmm. - Um...
so, what do we have? - We have a smattering, a sort of - potpourri of possibilities. - Potpourri?
Yeah. Um, here we go. We have, uh, poetry.
dickinson, you know, basic stuff.
little Neruda is always good. - I agree.
Oh, now, this is actually a real page-turner.
the Life of Gandhi? I... No, but he...
nobody has ever been quite so cool as him.
um, lighthouses. A Good Man Is Hard to Find.
uh, the title alone. - Anna Karenina. I don't...
Oh, now, that's funny. - [Both laugh]
no, actually, no, funny is here.
maybe it's not that funny.
no, actually that's funny. Very funny, and true.
good. OK, good. Um...
but, uh, if you could pick only one.
Ah. Well, I would say that nothing rivals - the romance of Fishcliff. - [Laughs]
I'm being honest. I just walked around and I just grabbed stuff.
I just grabbed whatever I could grab.
[Clerk] You were lookin for? - Sold.
[Clerk] I'm sorry? - I want them all.
these were just suggestions, I...
make sure he gets the commission for this.
[Clerk] He doesn't work here. - Well, he should.
you are smooth.
uh, actually, no, I'm not smooth.
I'm, uh, Dan. Sorry. - [Both laugh]
Marie. [sniffs]
Hey. Hi.
um, so, Marie, can I make it up to you?
[Dan] OK. Here is your tea. Hot.
watch it. And there is my orange juice.
and I bought a muffin, but I think they gave me a small planet.
[Marie laughs] - I should put that down.
thank you. - I have napkins and utensils.
I'm a big believer in forks. - [Laughs]
and you are not, apparently.
so, Dan... - Yes.
you were born? - I was born.
like everybody else. And I grew up, like everybody else. Good?
um, OK. What else?
I went to school, and I had a Bonanza lunch pail.
this show, 60s, a TV show.
when I was ten, I wanted to be a magician.
so I used to hold these magic shows for all the kids in the neighborhood.
I tried to make a neighborhood girl levitate.
and she didn't. And it involved a body cast, and several stitches...
[Marie laughs] ...the end of my...
[Dan] Let me tell you something, something I've never...
[Laughs] You're gonna laugh. Something I've never told anybody...
...in my life.
um, and this is really hard for me to say.
and then she got, uh, sick.
and, um, then she was gone.
and, uh...
it's taken a while.
we should probably talk about something else.
so you're telling me that you're one of those widowers with three daughters who preys on unsuspecting women in bookstores?
it seems that would be me. - Been there.
Really? - [Laughs]
no, it seems that it's been...
...seriously hard. - No. Um...
no, we're OK now. We're really OK.
[Whispers] You don't have to smile.
better than the alternative.
[Cell phone rings] - Ah.
can you hold? - Mm-hmm.
excuse me. - Mm-hm.
Hi. No, no, I'm minutes away. Yes.
um, I have to go. - Oh. OK.
I just lost track of time.
I wish we could keep talking.
well, it was nice, and a bit unusual, meeting you.
maybe I can call you sometime? - Uh, that might be awkward.
cause you're in a relationship? - Yes. A new one.
I would've found out if I hadn't been talking.
that's true. - But it's not exactly fair, is it?
I mean, you know all about me... - Thank you.
and I know nothing about you. I don't wanna go through the rest of my life wondering about the woman in the bookstore who let me do the talking.
all we'd be is two people finishing a conversation.
uh... OK. No harm in that.
[Sighs] Oh, OK.
call. Or don't, but, uh, call.
Oh! Um, hey, hey, hey!
just so you know, um, I would even call to say I'm not calling.
hmm.
[Laughs] Um...
OK.
I'd even call to say I'm not calling? Wow.
sorry. Sorry!
I, um... I never do this kind of thing, officer.
I'm usually very careful.
and nobody believes in...
welcome to Rhode Island. - Yeah, OK.
Yeah, it's nice to be here.
Hey. - Hey.
[Laughs] What's wrong? - Nobody.
I mean, nothing. - [Both laugh]
Danny's back.
dude, are you all right? - What? Yeah.
no, no, no, I'm good. I'm good. Yeah. - Really?
cause you don't... you don't seem good.
well, it was the strangest thing. I, um...
Wow. - Wow what?
I met somebody, and she's really something.
hot damn! - Bro, that is beyond huge!
you got her number? - Yeah.
you gonna call? - It's complicated.
no, it's simple. You've gotta call.
no, he just met her. He's probably worried it's too soon.
no, it's never too soon. Especially for somebody his age.
Amy, Dan met someone. - Shh...
he met someone? - Dan met someone?
come here. How soon till he can call? - Shh.
I don't know. I haven't been single for years.
me neither. My God, who is she? - Uncle Dan met someone?
Dan met a hottie. - [Overlapping chatter]
all right, all right. That is enough.
you know what? Let's ask Annie.
just now? - Now.
what does she look like? - Um...
she... - What's the, um?
the question? - This is my brother, Dan.
and, um, he needs your advice. He met some hottie downtown, and, um... She's a little shell-shocked.
wouldn't you be? Mitch neglects to mention that in their weekend away, she's gonna meet our entire family.
I didn't want to scare her off. - Let's go, everybody! Let's go.
Congratulations.
so, um, Annie?
it's Anne-Marie. Um, Mitch calls me Annie, but, uh, I'm Marie everywhere else.
I've two Marys and a Martha in my exercise class, - so I didn't wanna confuse people. - No. That would be not good.
I... I prefer Marie. - [Mom] Come on, sweetie.
women are on the porch. - Girls out there, guys in here. Come on, Dan. Let's do it.
perfect! OK. The briefest time units. Four letters.
[Eileen] Mili. - [Woman] Oh, wait.
Nano! ...A- N-O. Great!
Hey, no spying.
you guys are way behind! - That's not helping.
uh, I don't think "secretive" fits.
no, it doesn't fit. "Secretive" doesn't fit.
let's move on to 12 across. - We're movin' on.
for you to be interested in someone, she must be really special, right?
skip 12. - This is what I'm trying to tell you.
it is not going to happen. She is already dating somebody.
that's not your problem, bro. - [Sighs] Actually, it kind of is.
listen up, 15 across, five letters, pan-fry.
pan-fry. - Pan-fry. Uh, "grill." Uh...
dude, is there a rock on her left hand?
uh, no, not yet. - Then all's fair.
all right, now focus, people! Pan-fry!
saute. - Oh, my gosh. Of course it's saute!
and, uh, the word before, did we try "zeitgeist"?
it would be E-l-T. - I think it would make "ozone" work.
Lord, we hit the mother lode! - [Laughter]
ten letters. "Anything that can go wrong, will." So...
earth to Dan. We're still at across.
we're not even at down, Dan. - We're dying here, buddy.
we're done. - Hooray for the dishes.
congratulations, yeah. - [Cheering]
let's check it! - What now, boys?
dishes, duh!
what happened? You were useless out there.
sorry, guys.
lay off him. He's got a lot on his mind.
saute. - Dad, Mom.
what do you think of?
well, Mitch, it's too soon to tell.
that being said, she's bright, lovely, adorable, and if you botch this up, we'll keep her and get rid of you.
Dan, honey, you missed a spot.
seriously, dude. That girl is smokin'. Amazing. Really.
what do you think of her? - Um, she's great.
let me have a bite.
[Inaudible] - [Woman] Hey, hey, hey, hey!
no, no! Let's go, Gus. - All right.
can I show you where we are on this map...
Oh, yes. Yes. ...here?
um, if I had known, I would have never...
not my brother's girlfriend. - Uh, no, of course not.
and, for the record, I never called you a hottie.
Hey, we are... This is the bay. - Oh!
and we're right there. - I see.
so, what should we do? - Um, it's kind of funny.
maybe we should just tell everyone.
no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
we didn't do anything wrong. It was sweet...
good! You guys are getting to know each other.
Yeah. Just showing her where we are on the map.
[Boy] Hey, Uncle Mitch, you're not counting.
OK, OK. Hey. I know what's goin' on here with you two.
you're not hiding. [Laughs]
go ahead. One!
two! Go! - OK.
all right. I'm... - Three!
clay, I know you're in that back closet.
[Clay] Come on! - [Mitch] Four!
[Clay] Do over! Do over!
five! Six! I'm counting to 200.
I see you. - Yes, we do.
I'm gonna lay down for this whole thing. Eight!
Mitch is a great guy. - He is!
he's fun and, uh, funny.
uncomplicated in a... in a good way. Just what I need.
he's a great guy. - [Mitch] Nine!
see, I just ended this long, messy relationship, and I joined this gym and Mitch was there.
he's a great guy. - [Chuckles]
you keep saying that. - Well, because he is.
so good luck... to all of us. - OK.
so a little bird told me you're gonna be syndicated.
Lilly. They're looking at a bunch of columnists. It's a long shot at best.
she's amazing. Name a place, she's either lived there or visited.
tibet, Chile, Berlin when there was the Wall.
she's... [laughs]
wait! Whoa, whoa, what'd I miss?
well, Mitch certainly made out. - Yep.
and what about you? Have you found anyone?
dad, don't... [sighs] - Look, I know you always say that with Suzanne you won the lottery and that to try again would feel greedy, but it's been four years.
can we just walk, please?
I wanted to spare you. - [Laughter]
and I never smelt a thing! - [Groaning]
somebody please pass the corn.
[Marie] And that's how we met. - I got it.
[Mitch] My version... - [Marie] No.
what's your sign? - Scorpio, Libra rising.
Oh, my God, so am I. - Really?
do you have any siblings?
[Marie] No. - Who wants corn? Any...
tell us something about yourself few people know, not even Mitch.
I am an, um... an accomplished - maker of pancakes. - Talent show.
talent show. - What would your perfect day be?
mine would start with Annie, and end with Annie...
we're not asking you. So you were saying?
uh, my perfect day would start with going to a country where they speak a language I don't know, new customs, someplace where I'm completely out of my element.
welcome. I think you've arrived.
I want to say, the first time...
the first time that I saw her...
sweetheart, sweetheart, you don't have to shout.
well, I thought that I just died - because there's an angel in the room. - Mmm. Thank you.
[Cara] Are you and Mitch in love?
this corn is like an angel.
[Girl] Let's design a tent tonight. - Yeah! Big giant one!
we can make it have ceilings!
dessert! Dessert.
Oh, Danny, some of us are still eating.
it's getting late. - No, it's not.
I'm an only child too. This is really overwhelming, isn't it?
have you ever lived your perfect day?
when does a boyfriend become a lover?
OK. OK, all right, all right.
I think we can stop asking her questions. Been grilling her all night.
does it feel like we're grilling you?
no. No, not at all. - [Dan] She's just being nice.
no. I love the questions. - Oh, please.
Mm. On behalf of my family, I would like to apologize.
none of Mitch's girlfriends have ever been subjected - to such in-depth questioning. - Dan does have a point.
[Dan] Right? Not the body double. - No.
what was her name? Oh, God! - Not the Knicks City Dancer.
or the massage therapist.
none of the flight attendants from every major and regional airline who've wheeled their carts through this house.
OK, that's enough. - What? Am I wrong? Come on.
wow, Dan. Thank you for pointing that out.
you're the smartest guy I know.
he's right. It's Annie's turn to ask me whatever...
she prefers Marie.
ask me whatever you want, Marie.
I don't have any questions. - Oh, come on.
Mitch said early on that if I'd forgive him his past, he'd forgive me mine.
well, that's a stupid thing to do.
OK, into the family room. - Hey, guys. You done?
kids, come on. Into the family room.
John, bring the pies, please.
not you. You'll be doing the dishes alone.
[Mom] Six. Six letters.
[Cara yelling] Yes, yes, yes!
[Clay] Good job. Good job.
second word. - [Woman] Second word.
[Cara] You, you! - Hey.
I'm sorry. I was way, way out of line.
no, you're never out of line. You're my brother.
you'll understand when I tell...
nothing you can say would upset me.
can I just say one thing? ...the bookstore...
when you were talking about my other girls,
I realized something.
what I feel for Marie is different.
you know that feeling in, um... in your...
heart. - Yeah.
when your heart is just... - Pounding.
pounding. And... - Like it's actually outside your ribs.
Yes. - Exposed, vulnerable...
Yeah. It's... - Wonderful and awful and heartsick and alive, all at the same time.
Yes. Yes. Yeah, what do you... what do we call that?
[Laughs] Uh, love.
you always did have the words.
stanford or Berkeley. - Oh, those are great schools.
maybe University of Washington. - Huh.
or somewhere closer to home.
Lil, you have trouble sleeping, you know where to find me.
dad.
uncle Mitch, are you going in for your good-night kiss?
you bet. - Mom and Dad's old - "separate bedrooms till married" rule. - Kinda high school.
I agree with that rule. - Thank you.
you're welcome. - Mitch, what're you doing?
Marie brought some books, but I thought she should read a real book by a real writer.
Oh, no, no, no. Not a good idea. - Au contraire.
please don't. - Best book I've read.
may be the only book you've ever read. - Funny.
be nice. - If you can sign it, that'd be great.
that's first edition. - It's the only edition, Mom.
Oh, now. Good night. - Good night.
sleep tight.
um, I really wish you wouldn't.
good luck? That's it?
OK, we can work with that.
Hi.
good night.
[Dan sighs] Good morning. - Hey.
say, "Good morning." - Morning.
Yeah. Good. - [Laughing]
[Clears throat] - Have fun.
here you go, sweetheart. There you go.
[Mitch] Marie. Will you join us, please, beautiful girl?
Hey, Mom. - Yeah, honey?
mom, will you hit that music? - Sure.
you need this more than I do. Here he comes.
all right, Dan. Get on over here. Here we go, boxer shuffle.
and I wanna see those fists up. Three, two, one.
to the right!
get a good bounce. Five, six, seven. Switch!
five, six, seven. Whoo!
four, five, six, seven. Counting!
you wanna take it, babe? - You wha?
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. - OK.
salsa? - [Indistinct chatter]
the floor is yours, baby.
and left, and one...
OK, hold on, hold on, all right. Dan. Dan gets to go up front.
beginners in the middle. Keep your eyes on Marie. Doing good. Doing good.
one, two, three, four. - Yeah!
let's do the arm a little bit. - All right.
OK, everybody. Look, Marie, what to do. Dan, what not to do.
[Laughter] - The other way.
you were excellent.
thank you so much.
Oh, you're welcome. - That's great.
you always hate to start it, but then you feel so great after...
Wow. That's a good stretch.
Oh, yeah. - Ready?
Hey, maybe you'll try that on me a little bit later.
it's good.
dad? - Lilly, get your sisters and meet me in front. Now.
where are you going? Can we come with you?
can we, can we, can we?
my girls are looking for a little quality alone time with their dad.
but I promise we'll do it another day. All right?
Lil, come on. Let's go. In the car.
girls, let's go.
dad, what is it? Nana's gonna teach me how to knit.
Cara, let's go. - No.
OK. What are you waiting for?
come here.
right here. Right here!
Oh. Oh, you're so heavy. I don't know what I'm gonna do.
all right. Ah! Oh! I'm gonna fall down.
I don't think I can do this.
[Dan] Wow.
no, no, no.
this used to be the place with all the shells and the papier-mache shark.
remember you loved the saltwater taffy?
when I was four. - Yeah, but... OK.
stick with me, guys. Oh, I have an idea! Bowling!
Yay! - Bowling, bowling, bowling!
sounds good.
life is full of disappointment.
big and sometimes even bigger.
so, what's it gonna be?
the lighthouse or the whaling museum? Your pick.
do you know why we have lighthouses? - Because they're neat?
that's right. Yes.
and also because they help when it's dark out.
they, uh, help keep boats safe and keep us from crashing into the rocks.
because when you're out there and you're being tossed back and forth by those big dark waves and you think that you'll never feel land again and that you could just split into a million pieces and sink down all the way down... deep, it's the light that keeps us on course.
it's the light... - Dad, are you OK?
course I'm OK... honey.
did you guys have fun? - No.
no.
jump inside. Let's go, honey. - Kids? Where've you been?
I know. I know. I'm... - Oh, we looked all over.
for an expert on parenting... - I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking.
Hi, buddy. Hi.
[Exhales] I'm sorry. - Come on, buddy.
[Yells] - I got it.
Dan. She was amazing. You should've seen her.
she killed the last quarter mile.
I was fast. Wasn't I? - Yeah, it was like I couldn't catch up.
even your sweat is beautiful.
Where'd Dan go?
[Mitch] Mom, she moves like a goddess out there.
[Nana] Yeah? - [Mitch] She's like a panther.
you know, just her body...
she's competitive, but I just wanted to pounce. You know what I mean?
I wanted to ride her up the beach. She was...
[Nana] Don't do that. - [Mitch] She was like my stallion.
I wanted her to be in front of me. You know what I mean?
[Nana] Marie. There's fresh towels up there in the cabinet to the right.
I miss your skin.
[Sighs] I miss your smell.
Mm. I miss...
I miss your eyes. [laughs]
dad! - [Chuckles] I...
you're such a freak! - I...
no, sorry. That was just my loser of a father!
Yeah, he was totally spying.
[Marie] Hello? Hello? - We gotta talk.
[Stammering] Can it wait? - Is this working for you?
[Sighs] - I mean, really working. Be honest.
I'm having a nice time. - A nice time?
Yes, I am. - Really? So you're enjoying yourself?
except for the soap in my eyes. - OK.
cause you know what? I'm not. I'm not enjoying myself, and I think that, as two people of principle, we should have ground rules. Don't you?
Oh, yeah, sure. OK, sure.
Oh. OK! All right, that's...
that's what I'm talking about. No, no, no.
we need to keep our distance. Stop. Stay away.
towel. - Stop. OK. I'm sorry.
thank you.
and, you know, stop reading my book. OK, just stop.
Why? - And that salsa thing you do...
what are you talking about? - The salsa dance.
this... This thing. If you could just not do that.
[Laughs] I'm sorry. - If you stop doing that as a rule, it would be very helpful to me.
there are other things you can do, such as not exist.
Oh. Thank you. - That... not... Yeah!
I said it. I said it. I didn't mean it, but I said it.
and you know what else I'm gonna do? - What?
I am going to make myself less attractive, so as to not encourage any inappropriate feelings.
OK, that's hilarious. But you know what? I... No.
I'm gonna stop thinking about you. - Good.
I will.
and if I start thinking about you, - which may happen in a moment of... - Weakness.
...weakness, I'm going to focus all of my thoughts on your flaws.
my flaws. - Your flaws.
and they are? - I have no idea, but you can rest assured that I am going to find...
just ask Nana. Oh!
I'm so sorry. Are you taking a shower?
Yes. I'm taking a shower.
Oh, well, a little advice. Old houses, old pipes.
thank you. Thanks. - Takes forever to heat up.
um, can I talk to you about something?
sure. Absolutely. - And can we just keep it between us?
it's just... It was... Um...
see, last night what I was...
you were talking about your life last night.
the importance of travel and of, um, trying new things, you know, and I just started thinking about... Amazing! Um...
all of that, you know, how much...
that looks like it's ready. - [Laughs] Right.
um... But just...
Oh, you're... You're still dressed.
Oh, I forgot.
I'll look away. I'll look over here.
anyway, so, I just realized, you know, really, um...
you know, I've been thinking a lot about what I wanna do, um, you know, in the future, like not just for school, but...
it's just hard to figure out exactly what I wanna do with my life.
I mean, I know I wanna go somewhere new and, you know, try new things, um...
I mean it's just hard to figure out, you know, - your place, like where you should be. - Right.
and just to have that experience, you know, and to...
which is, you know, what it's all about. You know?
[Marie] Right. - But it's also, I mean, it's also... I mean, it's also terrifying realizing what you want is what you want. You know what I mean?
you know, I think it's so interesting not...
interesting the way that, um, you end up somewhere other than where you, um...
Oh!
lunch!
mac and cheese. Nothing better.
adults are in the dining room.
you know, I think I'm going to mix it up and sit with my peeps.
Dan. Honey... - Mom, please. Just let me be.
Hey, guys. - Hi, Uncle Dan.
Hey. - Hi, Uncle Dan.
Hello?
Hi. - [Lilly] Hi.
what's going on? - Marie's helping me with something.
we're having no fun at all. - Yeah, I can see that.
how's she doing? - She's amazing.
Bye, Dad. - Bye.
Bye. - [Laughs] Bye.
so you were saying... - Oh, yeah.
and I was trying to, um, make, like, you know...
I was trying to make like a really heart.
but, you know, I didn't even know how to even draw a heart. So I cut it.
Uh-huh. - And it came out, like, it was so... it came out like a... like a star.
[Knock on door] - Yeah.
[Knock on door] - Yeah.
[Nana] Dan? Hi. - Hmm. Hey.
uh. Honey, you know we're worried about you. You know that.
and with your behavior last night and this morning, we are now officially worried.
well, thanks, I'm touched. But I'm fine. You don't...
we're having a private conversation. - Come on in.
no, come on in. This is good.
mom, go ahead, I'm all ears.
look, you know, you do so much for your girls.
and you do so much for all of us. What are you doing for yourself?
[Indistinct chatter] - Not now.
come on in. - Think about...
we're trying to have a talk. - It's fine.
we'd like to speak to you privately. - Stay.
go ahead, Mom. - Yes, honey.
is it 'cause Uncle Dan's acting weird? - Yes, it is.
there's an explanation for it.
please tell us. - I just wanted to talk to you.
dude, you got to be way backed up.
so I just hope from time to time you are treating yourself to a little self-love.
Oh, come on. - I talked to my urologist about this.
that's enough. Come on. - Sorry.
what are you talking about, man?
the real question, the one no one will ask, - is will Dan ever find love again? - No, he won't.
Howard. - I'm sorry, he won't.
I'm saying, one of the things, if you're open to it, love will find you.
Oh. - I suppose.
Hey, people. - And... perfect.
[Laughs] - I don't think I was being clear before - but you got to unclog that drain. - Uh-huh.
you gotta unplug that bottle. If I mixed a metaphor there.
Yes, you did. - So far what you've missed is, uh, "worried," "love will find," unclog the drain.
well, thanks. That is it.
no. That's not it. - We are done.
you can all... Oh, come on, Ma.
we met Margot Draper's daughter at the farmers' market.
who? - And she asked all about you.
you see, Danny, you gotta, you know, have a little fun.
which means that Ruthie Draper is gonna pick you up at 6: 00, - and you're gonna have drinks! - I don't even remember Ruthie...
you're gonna go on a date! - No, no.
no, I'm not going on a date, Mom.
Yes, honey, it's time.
Ruthie "Pigface" Draper. Mom, Dad, what, are you kidding?
not "Pigface" Draper. I'm sorry, that is downright cruel.
there's nothing cruel about it.
mom, I don't even remember Ruthie "Pigfaced" Draper.
I don't wanna go! I don't want to go with the pig face.
he's going. It's been decided! - No, I'm not.
I don't remember "Pigface" Draper. - This is a blind date.
we'll double. OK? Lt'll be fun, it'll be fun. Right, Marie?
Yes, it'll be fun. Yes.
that's my girl.
come on, it'll be swine... fine.
[Laughter] - I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
go hog-wild. - [Laughter]
all right. All right.
all right. All right.
here we go.
that's very good.
it's really... it's beauti... Hello! Hi.
Hi. Everybody, this is Ruthie Draper.
you know everybody. They're bigger. - Yes. Hi, everyone.
nice to see you again, Ruthie. - Hello, Dan.
Hi. - I'd know you anywhere.
I mean, you look just the same.
Ruthie, um, you look great.
[Laughter] - Funny.
no, no, no, don't... - So, Harvard Medical,
johns Hopkins... You're doing well for yourself, Ruthie.
Yeah. - Yeah, that's impressive.
it must not, uh, leave enough time though for... for dating?
uh, there was someone.
he was very special in my life, but, uh...
[sobbing] He was lost in a freak accident.
I'm so sorry.
thank you.
what's weird is that we'd only known each other three days, but it's... you know how sometimes you just know.
Yes. - Yeah. Yes, absolutely, yes.
um, yeah. - So you're a doctor?
Yes, yes. - What's your, uh, specialty?
um, I'm a plastic surgeon. - Oh, of course you are.
no, I know, I know, I know what you're thinking.
but I work exclusively with burn victims, with children - born with facial deformities. - Oh.
she is basically a saint. - [Ruthie] No. No, I'm just...
I'm just doing my little bit to help, I think. Just like your brother.
Oh, stop. I'm... - When I can't sleep at night,
I go online and I read your past columns. Have you read Dan?
only his fiction.
you're in for such a treat, really.
I mean, what... what you said, the mother of Couch Potato?
Mm-hmm. - "Hide the remote.
so, what if he has to get up and change the channel? At least it's exercise.
it's brilliant. And then... and the parents of the five picky eaters?
they had to make individual meals for each kid and...
what are you, a restaurant?
right. - Brilliant.
she used your every word. - All I'm saying, all I'm saying is that I don't have kids. And I don't, I don't have problems, but it's clear that if I do one day, your words will bring me comfort.
I'm sorry. I'm just gonna have to excuse myself. I can't help it.
I'm sorry. But a girl that moves like that,
I mean... [exhales] ...a guy has got to wonder.
Hey, man.
she's cool. Marie, you're cool, right? - Yeah. Of course. I'm cool.
but I don't think Dan is interested in her.
he's not? - I'm not?
I don't think you are. Are you?
Oh, nice. All right. Yeah!
I don't know what it was, but something was holding him back.
not anymore.
well, that's a beautiful thing.
we're coming.
all right. OK. Home again, home again.
I really love your car. - Oh, thank you.
Bye. - Bye.
nice meeting you, um, Ruth.
Yeah, you too. - Come on, guys.
actually, um, Dan and I are gonna go for a little drive.
don't wait up.
[Inaudible] - Oh.
Mmm, this is fantastic.
Mmm, this is fantastic.
I know what the secret ingredient is... love. Mmm.
better and better with every bite.
words cannot describe. - Mmm, thank you.
well, how are they? - Dad, they're scrumptious.
Mm-hmm. Truly mouthwatering.
almost on my third stack. - More, please.
and nothing's stopping you, right? - Nope.
it's a secret recipe, but she let me crack the eggs.
[Dan] Yeah?
so, uh, how's Captain Lucky doing this morning?
Oh. Uh, it was fun. - Yeah?
heard you worked up quite the appetite last night.
Yeah.
could I have one more there? - There you go.
you know what? Actually, I am a little hungry.
secret recipe. Right here. - Boy, these are good.
I love them. - Thank you.
how many have you had, Dad? - So did you uncork?
whatever did or did not happen, no one deserves someone more than you.
there you go. - [Indistinct chatter]
coin toss. Outside. - Hoo! Hoo! Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!
[Lilly] Yummy.
all right. Nice!
yeah? You're gonna do that? That what you're gonna do?
is that how we're gonna play it? Yeah! OK.
all right. Yeah, so you wanna take out my knees, huh?
come again.
line up, I need coverage over here.
line up! Line up! Here we go! - All right, bring it back.
Hike! - Hey, pork chop!
Marie! Marie! - Go, Marie!
[Shouting] - Danny!
why you persist in acting like a 15- year-old is beyond me.
I'm filled with reckless desire.
you ought to be filled with greater restraint.
what does that mean? - I think you know what that means.
dad, could you? - Oh, yeah.
Thanks.
Hello? No, I'm his dad.
someone named Jordy for you.
everybody! Everybody! Dan just got a phone call.
[Poppy] And you know, syndication is everything for a columnist.
OK, all right. Let me explain.
um, I've been asked to meet with the head mucky-mucks of the Lamson Newspaper Group.
they're driving down tomorrow and they are going to sit down with me.
[All exclaiming] - That's great!
maybe you should get the job first. - Yes, that's true.
Dan the man. - Thanks, man.
[Sighs] - Wow.
Wow!
dad? - [Laughs]
dad? Lilly just asked me why you were flirting with Marie.
I wasn't flirting. - Don't worry, I covered for you.
I told her it was nothing. - Because it was.
dad, I'm 1 7. OK? You were so flirting.
you know, it doesn't matter anyway.
it's not like she's the least bit interested in you.
but cool it, OK?
and, um, congratulations. - Thanks.
look, he took a bus here. He has relatives in Boston. Dad...
dad, he loves me!
OK.
you don't have to worry.
when it comes to sex, Marty is the one who wants to wait.
what about that sentence is supposed to give me comfort?
dad, I love him. - Honey...
I love him. - [Groans]
I love him. I love him. - No, you don't.
what we have is true love.
and just because you don't have it, doesn't mean you have to punish us.
infatuation is not love. Sexual attraction is not love.
you don't understand. - Uh, I don't understand.
no, you don't even understand that you don't understand.
what don't I understand, Cara? Please, help me out.
what is it? It's frustrating that you can't be with this person?
that... that there's something keeping you apart, something about this person you connect with?
and whenever you're near this person, you don't know what to say, and you say everything that's in your mind and in your heart.
and you know that if you could just be together, that this person will help you become the best possible version of yourself.
so Marty can stay?
I'm sorry.
[Laughing] I'm sorry.
Marty can stay?
Howard is going to drive you to the bus.
we called your aunt, she's waiting in Boston.
Yes, sir. - Look, I'm not your parent, but I think you should know, love is a dangerous feeling.
no, sir. - Are you arguing with me?
no, I'm... It's just...
love is not a feeling, it's an ability.
who told you that? - Made it up, Mr. Burns.
come say goodbye.
[sobbing] - Window. OK, that's it.
dad. - She'll see him again soon enough.
[Cara sobbing] No! No!
No! Marty! Marty! Marty!
that's sweet. - What's sweet?
how... How is that sweet?
it's OK. It's OK. Come on, it's OK.
to be that certain. To feel so much love.
love isn't a feeling. - No?
it's an ability.
well, if that's true, you have one gifted daughter.
you are a murderer of love!
OK, Cara. Next?
uh, Olivia has something with the girls.
Gus will be doing his usual. Bella is on the fence.
Howard and I will sing. - Oh, that's nice. Aunt Eileen?
put me down. - Oh, really? What's your talent?
murderer of love.
you were saying?
we have something planned for the whole family.
put us all down.
what's your Dad's talent? - Doesn't have one.
he's the only one excused from participating.
I give you Bella Wilson.
all right, Bella! - [Applause]
chihuahua.
[Boy] Go, Bella. - You OK?
I don't have a good feeling. - Do what you always do.
Marie is not a lip-sync kinda girl.
I gotta do something special. - Just... be yourself.
[Bella] Bulldog. [pants]
that's... - [cheering]
this is for Marty. - Want me to take the cherries?
Mm. Uh-uh. - OK.
Wow! - [Cheering]
[Girl] She tied it!
I got an idea. - I'm sure it'll be great.
it could be.
[Jane] OK, last but not least, Uncle Mitch.
uh, someone very wise, uh, my brother, once told me that if you want to be completely honest, sing.
um, by the way, I'd like to introduce my band.
I don't believe it. He hasn't played since she...
Yeah, Uncle Mitch!
[Applause] - What he said.
[Howard] Great job, guys.
[Sighs] What was that?
I couldn't... I couldn't stop myself.
what am I supposed to do now?
you can't do anything. He's my brother.
why did you sing for me... then?
because I... I'm...
page 92. "Did I just die?
because an angel walked into the room.
page 1 48. Uh, I'll forgive you your past if you'll forgive me mine.
it seems all his best lines were yours.
it's unbearable. I...
[Lilly] Dad? - Yeah, peanut.
will you come up to my room? I wanna show you something I made.
um, we'll do it tomorrow. OK, sweetie? I promise.
OK, Dad.
[Mitch] Oh, God!
Hey, what's going on? - Shh.
what is complicated being here? My singing.
I shouldn't have sang. - I know this.
no. It's not...
it was a bad song. I... - Is she crying or laughing?
Oh, no, no, no. Please. - Please don't do it.
[Mitch] Marie... - [car starts]
[Groans] - Here he comes.
[Mitch] Mom!
uh, no, no, no, no. I don't know what to say to him. I never lost a girl.
Oh, good. This is a first. - Wow.
OK. Oh, uh, oh, yeah, I'll follow through with these.
please stop trying to act normal.
said I was a great guy.
she said she loved me a lot.
and then she said...
...we should both go find our own true soul mates.
I'm so confused. I don't really know what happened from yesterday to today that made this happen.
there has to be something. You know, some reason she...
why are you looking at me? - Not looking at you.
he's looking into the vast void that is his future. You just happen to be there.
[Laughter] - Danny, do you have anything to add?
Yeah, what does the expert have to say? Come on.
uh... [sighs] - [Nana] Honey, the hard truth is we all liked her a lot.
Yeah, we really did. - [Groans]
this isn't helping. No.
[Sighs] Could somebody think of something fun to do?
OK, OK, um... OK, OK.
part of the Rat Pack! Singer. Um, um...
Dean Martin! Sammy Davis, Jr! - [Shouting]
Yes!
your turn, buddy. Come on. Let's do it.
[Mitch] OK.
go!
this is a, uh, gift... - Hi, Jordy.
[Marie] You can't talk. - No, but go on.
I had to leave. - I know.
Ben Franklin! - But the truth is, um...
yes? - ... I didn't get very far.
beautiful smile, lovely eyes, one-of-a-kind woman.
Marie! - Yes.
Oh, honey, don't, don't, don't...
[Lilly] Dad? - Hey, you.
can I show you what I made? - First thing when I get back, OK?
[Lilly] OK.
you again. - Nice to see you, officer.
how are you today? - You know why I pulled you over?
I sure do. I know what I was doing and I know it's all wrong.
this is gonna cost you. - Put it on my tab.
what was that? - Put it on my tab.
[Laughs] What are we doing?
it may be wrong. - Yes.
but there's a certain rightness to our wrongness, I think.
I think, um, we've got to think.
I mean, your girls, and how do we?
they're extraordinary and...
what? - I think this is all premature.
you do?
we don't even know if you can bowl.
all right. No, don't! Wait.
wait. No, no. You have to line up.
leave me alone! - Line up.
come on. - You come on. All right.
I'm just watching you. I'm not...
ready? - Woo!
[Music plays] - Oh! Thank you.
that's... - [laughs]
I liked that. That was a terrible shot, but I loved this at the end.
Oh, I wouldn't go yet.
[Pins crashing] - Not bad. That's good.
you're gonna break your arm like that.
no, no. Don't do it.
Oh, come on, come on, come on!
Yay! - Let's go at the same time.
[Lilly] Dad?
Oh, my God. Dad, what are you doing?
Oh... - [Mitch] What the hell? Marie?
Hey. - What the hell's going on?
we'll go. - They were just kissing.
[Indistinct chatter] - I can explain.
you two broke up, right? - Two hours ago.
we broke up two hours ago. - I know, I know, I know.
I thought that you left.
she did. She left, but she just didn't get very far.
what? - I can explain this.
Yeah, let him explain. - OK.
remember the woman at the bookstore? Here she is.
you told me to go after her, and I didn't.
it wasn't planned, Mitch.
I know how this looks. But, Mitch, I also know how it feels.
how does this feel, you son of a bitch?
Oh, my God! - [Shouting]
what happened? - I'm so sorry.
everybody, take it easy. You're not helping.
Oh, no. - I'm sorry.
[Nana] Oh, darling. Get some ice. Oh!
[Howard] Dan, you all right? You OK? - Marie!
no, don't go!
I don't know what we were thinking.
I'm sorry.
[Car starts] - Don't go.
dad? Get...
dad, wait!
what are you doing? Dad!
all right, this is your summons for your court appearance.
one last thing. You need to surrender your license.
you have guests.
Oh! Speak of the devil. Hi. - Hi.
Cindy Lamson. Editor of special features, Lamson Newspaper Group.
Hi. - Jim Lamson, publisher.
nice to meet you. - Yes.
we've been sitting here chatting with your family.
we've especially enjoyed the pleasure of meeting your lovely daughters.
Oh. - Hot cider?
thank you. That looks... Thank you very much.
looks great. Thanks.
father? Hot cider?
not only are you a murderer of love, but you're the worst parent ever.
sweet.
well, um, as you probably know, we have met with two other candidates, but my father and I are confident that we have saved the best for last.
uh, girls. You can leave if you like.
Oh. If it's all right, perhaps they should stay.
we like to keep the family involved.
well, Dan, here, he knows all about keeping things in the family.
don't you, Dan? - That's why we're so drawn to you.
what you represent in your column, your moral values.
the personal characteristics that are reflected in your writing, - Very impressive. - Honesty, trustworthiness...
[Jim] And we have great plans for you, Dan.
what we try to do is what you keep telling your readers to do.
what's that? - Put family first.
OK. OK. Here's the thing.
somebody hasn't been reading his own column.
I'm not sure what that means.
go away. You're a liar and a hypocrite. Cheating with your brother's girlfriend?
how long did you know her?
two moving violations and a collision? Was that part of the plan?
worst of all, you blew off Lilly.
she's been wanting to show you something she made for you.
but you never showed up.
hm.
I really messed up. - No, you didn't.
Yeah, I did, Mom. What I did to Lilly.
don't forget Mitch. - Oh, John.
and those newspaper people.
admittedly, not a good day for you, honey.
if I just stay focused on being their dad...
Oh, please. You know, love is messy.
I should know better. I hurt my kids.
go un-hurt them.
honey, you've made some mistakes. - Many, so many.
falling for Marie wasn't one of them.
can somebody get me another box, please?
Yep, yep. Coming.
Mitch.
Mitch, I...
if it was anybody else...
I am so...
hold that thought.
Hey, beautiful.
girls, I'd like to talk to Lilly alone, if I could.
OK, then. All of you.
I know I messed up. Big time.
Yep. - Yes, you did.
now, your mom...
I miss your mom.
all the time and I always will.
mom's gone. - Aw, honey. I see her every day.
I see her in your goodness, Jane.
and, Cara, your passion.
and, Lilly, you have her eyes.
and her smile.
so here's what I'm going to do:
I am grounding myself for life.
I'm sticking with you. I am going to be with you...
you're with us every day. - I'm not going anywhere.
see, I got a little confused with Marie, but that is over. OK?
I kinda lost my head.
got a little stupid because I love her.
that's... That's not...
I don't love her. And that's not what I meant.
I mean, how could I love her? I've only known her...
three days. - [Laughs] Yeah.
and how can you know in three days?
I don't know.
Yes, I do. I love her.
I love her. I love her.
I love her. I love...
I love her.
then go get her.
we so prefer her to you.
go.
[Whispers] Now. - Oh.
honey. Honey. For the road.
what is it? - I can't do it.
you must. - I don't have a license.
I'm pretty good with maps.
this is so queer. But I wouldn't miss it for anything.
[Dan] Dear readers, for most of you, this is my first column in your paper.
in the future, I will be answering your questions, but today, I wanna break from my usual format and talk to you about the subject of plans.
not so much my plan for this column, more like life plans.
how we all make them.
and how we hope that our kids make good, smart, safe plans of their own.
but if we're really honest with ourselves, most of the time our plans don't work out as we'd hoped.
so instead of asking our young people, What are your plans? What do you plan to do with your life?
maybe we should tell them this: Plan to be surprised.
it's falling out.
[Man] And that's it.

it has been more than a year since the Rodney King beating.
the twelve jurors in the trial of the four white officers...
have just returned with a verdict...
after deliberating for several days.
the four officers accused of assaulting Rodney King...
are on the way to the courthouse here in Simi Valley...
along with their lawyers.
as soon as they get here, the judge will call the jury...
back into the courtroom...
and the clerk will begin to read the verdicts.
we expect it will happen very, very soon.
on the other side of the courthouse...
a large crowd is developing.
these are people who have been monitoring this trial.
they are anxious to find out what the verdict is.
there it is. Come on.
hang a "U." Turn around.
Jack O'Hearts. That's it.
they ain't getting off.
the jury don't have fucking eyes?
Rodney King's getting his ass beaten, man.
they beating the black out of homeboy's ass.
bust me.
you ragweed-mouth motherfucker.
check this shit out. I wouldn't give a fuck...
if it was motherfucking Martin Luther King...
got clapped off, nigga, it don't matter.
ain't no brothers on that jury out there, fucker.
it's Simi Valley.
all good, decent white folk like yourself.
that's why they moved the venue. The cops are protected.
it's on videotape. You can't fuck with that.
they going down.
if they go down, I'll buy you some old-fashioned black pussy.
if them motherfuckers walk, you gotta spot me a ho.
and no white ho. I want a Puerto Rican.
where you gonna find a Puerto Rican in L. A?
I'll get you some Mexican shit.
I don't want no clumsy-ass Mexican.
I want me a badass Puerto Rican bitch.
I don't give a fuck if you gotta swim.
let's shake. It's about that time.
we do this short, simple, and clean.
detective Keough...
if you had a little time machine...
and you could travel back to the day of the shooting...
to the afternoon that you killed Mr. Robertson...
I'd like to hear what you'd do differently.
I wouldn't do anything differently, sir.
he drew down on me. I did what I was trained to do.
if anything, sir, I should've acted quicker.
the last man Robertson pulled a gun on isn't with us anymore.
thank you, Detective.
I think we've kept Detective Keough long enough.
chief Barcomb, I have a few questions.
fire away, Chief Holland.
I know it's been a long day...
and I know those chairs aren't well-padded...
so I promise to be quick.
you OK?
three weeks in SlS...
and you've made your first kill.
would you say you've proven yourself?
respectfully, sir...
I think the shooting board has to decide that.
do you think it could've been avoided?
no, sir, I don't.
it says here that you and your partner...
had Mr. Robertson bumper-locked...
for two days before the shooting.
why didn't you bust him for the weapon?
because we weren't sure he had the weapon.
the informant who told us is highly unreliable.
but you tailed him anyway for 680 man-hours.
he was on parole. You could've shaken him down...
but you let a two-time felon stroll around downtown L. A...
with a. 357 Magnum stuck in his jeans.
Why? Why?
we didn't want to get him on a bullshit weapons charge.
thank you, Chief Holland. We have to wrap it up.
officer Garcia, will you bring Sergeant Perry in?
sergeant Perry, we're not quite through beating up on you.
I have one final question before we adjourn.
time machine, sir?
Yes, the time machine.
chief, I'd get real proactive.
if I had a time machine...
I'd go back a decade and take out G-Bone
his street name-- before he killed a man for $10.
the time machine doesn't go back that far.
it goes back one week...
to the day Detective Keough chose to use deadly force.
what would you change about that day only?
nothing, sir. It was textbook.
the bullets were in the bad guys, not us.
we expect department personnel to use deadly force
only as a last resort, which it was, sir.
Bobby Keough's a good cop with a lot of potential...
and he dropped a menace to society.
it was a good call.
thank you.
thank you, Sergeant Perry, Detective Keough.
you gentlemen are dismissed.
we'll issue our findings at 9 A. M. tomorrow morning.
proceedings are closed.
call me.
it is the second full day of deliberations...
in the Rodney King beating trial.
no word on when the jury might reach a decision.
reporters, photographers and news media covering this case...
are sitting in the parking lot of the courthouse...
waiting until we get word that there is a verdict.
reporting live from the Simi Valley courthouse in
they should've wasted that worthless motherfucker's ass.
here. Settle your stomach.
Thanks, Jack.
how'd my nephew perform? - He aced it.
say hello to the department's new poster boy.
no, I'm telling you, I'll get suspended.
I'll end up being a fucking security guard at Taco Bell.
Bobby, you go down, I go down.
I go down, Jack goes down.
and Jack ain't going down...
so have some faith in the system.
a man is supposed to be nervous...
in front of his first shooting board.
listen, kid. Here's my advice...
for what it's worth.
live with it! - Jesus Christ.
good hands! - Held on to it.
I'm never going to live it down, am l?
don't go getting sad and weepy on us.
one mistake means you're human.
two mistakes means you're fired.
holy shit. It's a royal visit.
look what descended from the sixth floor.
Hey, Jimmy. - Jack.
how are you holding up, son?
I'm good, sir.
you should've seen this kid. He was outstanding.
ever thought about doing a tour with public affairs?
we could use a good-looking son of a bitch like you.
he's a good young cop, Jimmy, and he's mine.
well, I tried.
the board voted.
in policy.
you're off the hook, kid.
there you go. - Congratulations.
have a cigar.
the report will be ready in the morning.
you guys can get back into the field.
so, the vote...
the vote was four to one.
what? Who the fuck pissed backwards-- Holland?
Affirmatron.
I'd like to see his bald-headed black ass...
back in a radio car in South Central.
we don't need that shit.
he actually said "out of policy"?
Holland began contacting outside agencies a month ago.
he's doing civil service testing with the city of Cleveland.
he's leaving to run their P. D. Didn't hear it from me.
didn't hear it from you.
fuck Holland. Good riddance.
have to pin his stars on another brother...
or the community will go apeshit.
Jesus, Eldon, you sound like your old man.
it's true. - It's not such a bad thing.
everything I know--his old man.
a toast to Bobby. Right between the eyes.
thank you, guys. I mean it.
thanks for giving me the chance to prove myself in SlS.
Amen, Bobby. To Jack's squad.
Eldon, Jimmy has something to tell you.
you made lieutenant.
you're next on the transfer list.
fuck you, too, Jimmy.
no. We're not pulling your dick.
it's about fucking time.
it's about fucking time! All right!
Where's my badge?
the badge ceremony's Wednesday at the Academy.
a dozen lieutenants being promoted.
the biggest in department history...
if you can make it on time, Mr. Smart Ass.
I'll try to shove it into my busy schedule.
thanks for dropping by.
thanks for the cigars, Jimmy.
good luck, kid. - Thank you.
we'll hoist a few next week.
that'd be good, Jack, anytime.
looking forward to it.
that's our next chief, gentlemen.
that's a scary fucking thought.
I mean-- God help us.
I can't stand much more of that dump.
did you see that drunk tonight trying to paw me?
what drunk?
does it matter, what drunk?
what's the matter with you tonight, darling?
that's the third time you started to tell me something.
we shouldn't have any secrets from each other, Sue.
you're a fucking alcoholic.
Thanks.
there's goulash in the crockpot.
I'm not hungry.
did you just get home?
eleven prisoners got early releases.
I had to process them out.
Sal...
I made lieutenant.
you're kidding.
finally. - Yeah.
when will it show up on your paycheck?
not till after the ceremony, honey.
who the fuck is calling 900 numbers?
if it's anyone, it's you, and you don't remember.
the department tapes for manual labor.
watch this. It's the damn kid.
welcome to Sorority Slut Hot Line.
Yeah. Sorority Slut Hot Line.
fucking pay it. At least he's not a fag.
no, he's not a fag.
your damn kid has a girlfriend.
know that, Detective?
no. No shit?
she's very pretty, very sweet.
that's excellent. The boy's finding his dick.
I work in a jail. Do I have to listen to that at home?
OK, OK.
I'm sorry.
aren't you going to ask how the shooting board went?
aren't you going to at least ask me...
how the shooting board went?
I'm sorry, honey.
I have a hard time keeping track of all your shootings...
and investigations and interrogations and inquiries.
how did your shooting board go?
ln policy. - Like it would be anything else.
what is this? I recognize this.
I've seen it before somewhere.
Bobby's strutting around like a little bantam rooster.
you're just jealous of him because he's cute.
cute.
you are so lost in space...
you have no idea what the fuck's going on.
jealous of Bobby?
Bobby's a fucking coward.
Bobby's not a coward.
he's not?
OK.
chicken shit.
let me tell you how that Robertson case really went down.
my gun's gotta cool, because I blasted that freak in Pacoima.
it's time Bobby gets tested.
we're out there in this alley waiting.
robertson comes running out, smacks into Bobby.
they eyeball each other with their shit hanging out.
robertson says, "Boo," Bobby drops his gun...
and Mandingo goes track star.
Bobby dropped his fucking gun.
I don't want to hear this.
no, listen, because this is good.
so, I reach down, I pick up Bobby's gun...
and I go, Hey, yo, G-Dog!
or GQ, or whatever the fuck his name is.
he turns around and-- Boom!
I split this guy's eyeballs. It was a lucky shot.
the point is, I let Bobby take the triggerman slot...
to save his ass from big-time embarrassment!
how do you like that for "cute"?
fuck.
fuck it. Goulash? Oh, boy.
and you wonder why I drink.
Jesus Christ.
is that all you got?
Yeah, for now. For the moment.
man, you sure you're a cop?
just call me Sarge.
but no last name.
we've known each other for three weeks without last names.
I'm afraid if you tell me, you're going to...
what? Turn into a pumpkin?
something like that.
want to know my last name? - No.
no, I don't want to know your last name...
your division, your partner.
I like it like this.
nothing too serious...yet.
what just happened was pretty serious to me.
ready to go again?
whatever you say, Sarge.
that's what I'm talking about-- money.
orchard! Sidwell! - Did you hear that?
open up! I know you're in there!
orchard! Sidwell!
Where's the safe?
dump that shit.
Where's the money?
give me all the money now...
or I'll put you back in your cages.
this it? - Yeah.
what about our half?
I'm keeping your half...
because you couldn't control yourselves.
why did you dumb fucks kill those people?
what the fuck you think?
we're gonna let people walk out after they've seen us?
I don't give a fuck.
you live and breathe and walk the streets...
because of me and me alone.
you know that, don't you?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
your whore is dead. Dump her, too.
get off your asses.
I'm putting you in a fresh-blood case.
there was a quadruple homicide on Jefferson yesterday.
two coloreds fucked up a robbery.
monkeyshines. Why call us in?
the shit fairy paid me a visit. It's rolling downhill.
I hate it when the shit fairy visits.
one of the vic's was an LAPD dispatcher.
I got four bodies in the morgue.
this Rodney King shit has the department...
on the ropes, so get these gorillas.
show the world LAPD looks after its own.
Eldon, can we do this?
sure, Jack, we can do this.
help the guys out in South Bureau.
peltz and Sapin. They're overworked.
they'll be happy if SlS take point on this.
Bobby. - Yes, sir.
this could be a second chance for you.
I hope so, sir.
what's the deal with this new girl, Bobby?
what are you talking about?
I am a detective. Give me some credit.
what's her name? - Beth.
what's she do? -I don't know.
she works in the building.
bullshit. She's a cop.
I bet she's the only blue suiter...
who didn't drop her drawers when you flashed your shield...
and now you're intrigued.
I'm more than intrigued. Remember the stenographer?
Bobby, don't do that. You fucking idiot.
you'll regret that when you're my age.
I'm sure I will.
the latest now on the Rodney King beating trial...
Hey, Lefty. Let's see.
I'll have a...
couple of coffees, regular. - Two black coffees.
can we turn this shit down? - Thanks, man.
guys, getting your swerve on?
Eldon, what's shaking?
no, that's fine.
so, how's Sally?
Sal? She's my angel.
what brings you south of King?
please tell me Jack gave you our case.
van Meter's all over this one.
he wants us to help you guys out.
Eldon, it's dog shit.
it's crazy-man stuff.
these dumbasses hotfooted it without tapping the till.
hypes or cranksters. They gotta be ex-cons.
any wits? - The fifth victim.
did you interview him?
no. He's in surgery at Drew King.
metro's on him 24 hours.
that's all we know. You're welcome to it.
all right, partner.
gentlemen, thanks for the help.
thanks a lot, guys. - You bet.
keep ducking.
Thanks. - You're welcome.
they called again about the shooting board report.
send it back without my endorsement.
attach this cover letter.
do you know what you're doing?
declaring war.
that's crazy. You can't upstage a hard-ass like Van Meter.
he has a weak spot-- Eldon Perry.
weak don't come to mind when I think of that redneck.
Perry and his little partner...
iied through their teeth for eight hours straight.
Perry killed Robertson, not his partner...
and I'm going to prove it.
I'm going to get their badges. Will you help me?
whatever you want.
I need copies of every piece of paper with Perry's name on it.
every ratings report, every division log...
payroll, medical, commendations, everything.
his partner, too.
Arthur, this is some dangerous shit.
Sailboats-- I don't understand them.
I prefer a big boat with a big motor...
on a big lake behind a big dam.
how about you, Arthur? You a motor or sail guy?
I don't like boats, and I don't like you.
has this department been so bad to you...
you feel driven to humiliate it?
don't hide behind LAPD blue.
it's not your color.
no one buys your sudden transformation...
into this beacon of higher consciousness and moral right.
the last thing your ham-fisted political ploy...
will get you is four stars.
you should rethink this-- very seriously.
very seriously.
I know how you fight.
I'm ready for you.
we can handle this like gentlemen...
or we can get into some nigger shit.
so you do whatever it is you feel you have to do.
I plan to, nigger.
they didn't get a dime?
no. They're crazy.
they shoot and run.
they're like dogs. They have no heart.
no, sir, they don't.
you have any problems with anybody in particular...
in the neighborhood-- any troublemakers?
no video, huh?
camera not work.
what's upstairs there, apartment?
I live with my daughter.
my wife...
we married 22 years.
Mr. Kim, we will get the guys that did this.
give me a call if there's anything you need.
we're here to help. - Thank you.
please. Excuse me.
it's all right, man.
what are you doing?
I'm just getting a feel for the scene.
how'd it go down, Sherlock?
I don't get it.
one suspect kills Mrs. Kim and hops the counter.
shooter two pops each vic as they walk in.
this is what I don't get.
he moves the bodies over here...
hiding them from the street.
that must've taken some time.
keep going.
all right.
outside they run into Mr. Lewis.
one of them shoots him in the neck.
they get into the car and they're gone.
I'm sorry. That does not make any sense.
it never does, Bobby.
what do we do now?
why don't you ask Mr. Kim for a broom...
and bag everything in this gutter for the lab?
let's get that gutter, too.
heads up.
let's jack these motherfuckers and rattle some cages.
what's up, Maniac? - Ain't nothing happening.
you know I be shaking it down.
Yeah. - What it look like, man?
I'm trying to get my paper, that's what it is.
up against the wall, boys. You know the drill.
let's go. Palms on the bricks.
man, we ain't do nothing.
you, in the gorilla suit, turn around.
turn the fuck around, man.
man, I ain't do nothing.
think this bullet gives a shit how tough you are?
you're under arrest. -For what?
give me your elbow! Don't do that!
hook him up. Let's go.
calm the fuck down, man.
fuck you, man. - Calm the fuck down!
what the fuck I did?
why did you shoot my car?
I ain't shoot your fucking-- Oh, man!
get in there. Let's go, come on.
get down. Get in there.
man, that shit sting!
I know, man, he's crazy.
just cooperate with us. What's your name?
maniac, man. They call me Maniac.
who the fuck are you, Metro?
Yeah, we're Metro. I'm Detective Smith.
this is my homeboy, Detective Jones.
somebody dropped a dime on you, big guy.
you robbed a liquor store and dumped four good citizens.
now your ass is getting gassed.
why you running that bullshit at me?
how about this?
you're fucking killing me with that shit.
I'll find an alley and empty this can up his nose.
he's fucking crazy, all right?
man, fuck him! - He'll do it again.
he cool-ass people.
he be throwing us out with 40s and shit.
we keep our eye out for him.
somebody came in blasting the other day...
on a civilian, man. That shit ain't cool.
speak fucking English!
he's a good dude, bro, so we gonna handle this.
shut the fuck up. I want to know who did this.
if you help me bring these guys down...
I'll bust a doper and give you his shit.
two motherfuckers that ain't from around here.
somebody gonna get drunk and brag about it.
he went up against Mr. Kim and did his wife.
why is somebody gonna do that?
because he a player. He got game.
game? What's he play, golf? Speak fucking English!
word on the street, he got strip club...
Iadies and stuff like that.
he selling that flat-ass booty.
you're telling me fucking bedtime stories.
check it out, cop.
hold still now.
this hurts a lot less without a broken nose.
I told you! Kim's a straight-up gangster!
he a pimp like that.
I hope you're not fucking with me, Maniac.
ed, it's Detective Smith.
Yeah. Do a make for me?
Yeah. Thanks, Ed.
kim's in the gang book.
suspicion of loan sharking and pandering.
he's got a club on Olympic, just like you said.
unhook him.
where you going?
I gave you what you wanted, right?
what do you want?
I want a goddamn cheeseburger.
Tommy's or Fatburger?
Fatburger, double king with cheese.
sounds good. Let's go. Get in.
he's tripping, huh?
shit, I'm getting in the front seat this time.
so, you little sneak...
you're smitten with this broad with no last name...
and you're dumping stenographers.
but I don't know anything about her?
sometimes you're clueless.
you'll make a great Pogue someday.
how about a fifth of scotch over here?
I admit it, Bobby.
I get played now and then because I'm trusting.
I like giving people the benefit of the doubt.
when my trust is abused...
it drives me out of my fucking mind.
not as much as she's driving me out of my mind.
she's black, Eldon.
that's why I don't talk about her.
you be dating a sister.
I didn't know you were an ebony and ivory man.
I don't want to hear a bunch of black jokes.
amigo, you think I care about...
the size, shape, color, or political party...
of some sweet thing you're rolling around with?
while you're thinking about pussy...
I'm talking about Henry Kim...
and his "struggling immigrant from South Central" tap dance.
he's a gangster.
think it was a hit on his wife?
it wasn't a hit.
it would've been in and out, a couple of vics.
these guys lingered.
back to robbery.
I bet this place moves five or six Gs of pussy weekdays...
and double that on weekends.
that's a lot of cash, Bobby.
let's go fishing.
what do you want?
half an hour ago, I wanted this drink...
now I want to fuck that girl.
sorry, she can't do that.
find me one that can, slick.
you got eight girls here. You're not pimping them?
I'm not talking to you.
you're LAPD. You beat Rodney King.
I did not kick Rodney King's ass...
but I'll have some serious fun kicking your ass!
did you take Kim's money, you son of a bitch?
talk to me!
did you put on a ski mask and take his damn money?
get the fuck back inside! Now!
did you kill his fucking wife?
no, no, no! I didn't do that!
get the fuck out of here now!
now! Move! Now!
his family is like my family. I didn't steal!
I heard they got 200 grand.
no, look, they took a safe.
but it only has 1 50.
anybody show up for work late this morning?
anybody in your little sewing circle blow town?
give me a fucking name!
du Ku. He's not home. I don't know where he is.
this guy doesn't own one fucking chair?
there's nothing in there.
Holy...fuck.
Oh, man.
I guess that's what they mean by chilling out.
shit. - They tortured this guy.
he sang, man. - He hit a high fucking "C.
all right.
our bad guys have turned on to Henry Kim's business somehow.
snatched the bag man...
tortured him to find out where the money was hidden.
they go in, kill four people...
come out, wing a fifth...
torch the getaway car...
and take off in a second set of wheels.
this thing's coming together, Bobby.
let's call this in and take another shot at Kim.
Yeah, good.
morning, Matt.
morning, Sergeant.
here.
thank you.
the verdict might be today.
I bet they get off.
that's my opinion. What about you?
Jesus, you talk about everything else...
from dog racing to foreign policy.
how come you never talk about the King thing?
Bobby, I avoid the subject...
because it pains me to see real criminals free...
while four of my brothers eat political shit...
because the Pogues outlawed the choke hold.
when they got rid of the choke hold...
it left us with a stun gun and a baton.
the choke hold saved lives...
but nobody ever got elected saying that.
they don't give those guys enough cars, radios...
equipment or live bodies to man the watches.
then they take away the tactics that work...
and indict them for using approved tactics that don't?
Bobby, this is simple.
either four good cops are going down...
because they followed the department manual...
or they get off and we're back in the Summer of '65.
I don't know about that. You really think so?
if they get off, this city burns.
Perry.
I got it. Let's go.
the wit's conscious.
freeway bags for these?
how's he doing?
in the last couple of hours, he's moved around a bit.
good.
Mr. Lewis, how you doing?
I'm Detective Keough. This is Detective Perry.
sir, we'd like to ask you a couple questions.
he's whacked out on painkillers.
he can't speak. His larynx has been removed.
the bullet shattered it.
sir, can you write?
here.
Mr. Lewis, could you identify the race of the attackers?
one was white, and one was black.
Hey, Jack.
Hi, guys.
brief me on Jack O'Hearts.
I've been getting calls all day.
my two best guys are on it, giving 200%.
tell me you got the suspects in your trunk.
my trunk has nothing but a spare tire and underwear.
you gotta have some breaks.
I interviewed the "K" who owns the crime scene...
who I sniffed out as a lesser light of the underworld...
and it turns out he's got a strip club.
he's pandering, a cash-and-carry businessman...
and he had a safe with a buck-fifty in it.
that's real money. You guys found a body.
kim's bag man. - Your shooters are Korean.
that's what we thought till we interviewed the wit.
he can't lD them. They had ski masks.
he can lD race. It was a salt-and-pepper team.
a safecracking spook and a blue-eyed peckerwood.
who does that sound like?
how about Orchard and Sidwell?
always Orchard and Sidwell with you.
what is that?
you're not dumping my two best informants.
Jack, your pets, your science projects
whatever the fuck they are-- the evil shits did this.
it's time we put these slick twists down.
your job is not to think.
it is to follow orders, to execute plans...
and to be a good soldier.
you're a goddamn great soldier...
because you leave the planning and fixing to me.
are you listening? - I'm listening, Jack.
listen to my philosophy. It's very simple.
I am a performer of unpleasant tasks...
so that the majority of people...
are free to perform pleasant ones.
the last thing I care about is what you think.
I got it, Jack.
good. Open your fucking ears.
orchard and Sidwell were in San Diego working for me.
you and Bobby will do whatever it takes...
to clear Jack O'Hearts.
find some bad guys and get a search warrant!
you listening? - I'm listening, Jack.
you better be listening!
I don't need you making shit up!
take the warrant and serve it with Rico's platoon.
do what you do.
OK?
OK? - OK.
where are you going?
OK. OK.
it'll be a beautiful thing.
pull this off, you'll be sitting on waterskis...
sucking fumes from my new boat...
a couple of kegs and hookers in Lake Havasu.
stick this in Holland's mailbox...
and get your asses back on the street.
forget finding the real guys? Did I hear that right?
Hey, Perry.
you guys get anywhere with that Jack O'Hearts case?
we just had a breakthrough. How are you guys doing?
just got a drive-by murder-suicide
a 12-year-old wasted an ice cream truck driver.
another normal day.
good luck nailing those bastards.
keep us posted.
sit down, Bobby.
we're going to find a couple of assholes...
and bury them in the Jack O'Hearts.
we cannot pin four murders on patsies.
no fucking way.
the real shooters need to be taken off the streets.
I absolutely agree with you.
they're vermin and should be exterminated.
but you got a crime and you got criminals...
and if you're meticulous, somehow you make a match.
we're in the getting-shit-done business.
what are you talking about? You know who did it.
come on!
how can Jack involve us in this type of shit?
what the hell's he thinking? - How fucking dare you!
who the fuck are you to question Jack Van Meter?
you don't question his orders. You follow them!
I ought to kick your ass, man!
you know jack, Bobby!
you were tested and failed!
that's my daddy's gun.
you see those? Eleven men.
he and Jack were partners...
and the only goddamn reason this city's here...
is because they made it possible.
they built it with bullets!
hunted down evil fucking parasites...
that would've committed thousands of crimes...
would've ruined hundreds of lives.
they protected the good people, Bobby...
so that they could grow and not the cancer!
who the fuck are you to question anybody?
Eldon, please. Take it easy!
come on, take it easy. I'm with you.
good. - We're going to do this.
OK?
how do we get a search warrant?
sergeant Perry?
I'm from the paper. You got a minute?
no.
I heard SlS is attached to the Jack O'Hearts killings.
that's a little overkill, don't you think?
is there some political motivation here?
I know you've said you've been misquoted in the past.
that's why I brought a tape recorder.
you give me a quote, and I'll run it...
exactly as you say it-- word for word.
the question is this
why has an elite force like SlS been asked to solve...
a routine multiple robbery homicide in South Central?
unless there's something that we don't know about.
quote
get your fucking head out of my ass...
and stop writing that cocksucking criminals...
are victims, instead of the pigs they are...
and let motherfucking cops do what motherfucking cops do.
end quote. Print that.
Hey, Deena.
sergeant.
how you doing? I'm Detective Keough.
Hi. Good to meet you.
what brings SlS to my office?
the quadruple on Jefferson...
and a linked mayhem homicide in Koreatown.
dead dispatcher. - That yours?
we're helping out South Bureau. You know Peltz and Sapin?
the Bourbon Brothers? Good Homicide guys.
we're taking point because they're overloaded.
we found the gentlemen that did it.
we need a search warrant.
better have more than on that Hollywood Hills double.
I got hell from the judge on that one.
you could finish the story.
his Honor signed, and I nailed the bastard.
you got lucky. Let's see what you got.
it's a little thin, but these are some bad hombres.
this guy sodomized an 80-year-old woman for two days.
this one raped a little girl in front of her family...
during a home invasion. Read the file.
calling these circumstantial would be a compliment.
I can't issue on this. No judge will sign it.
we're not going to trial, for Christ's sake.
it's a search warrant. There's probable cause.
don't bullshit me. I can't process this.
you can process it... and you will.
and by tomorrow morning...
those two young bucks will be dressed out...
and strapped across the hood of my Chevy.
so says the playbook, Deena, so do it.
be a team player.
Jesus Christ, you got Alzheimer's?
you know the deal.
you want to change it?
give me your phone.
do you have any shame? - I try not to.
I'll issue the search warrant, but no judge will sign it.
the judge is my problem.
we'll wait, Deena.
fine.
I'm lost. What just happened?
Deena went to USC.
good sorority, Dean's list, the whole thing.
she's a sharp gal, but like a lot of young girls...
away from home for the first time...
she experimented and got into team sports.
the whole football team, man.
fight on for old S. C!
it was a hell of a videotape. I never saw it.
she married some CEO from Century City who doesn't know...
and that's the way she wants to keep it.
and that's the deal.
there's always a deal.
judge Russo, I'm sorry.
I really appreciate this, sir.
you're sure about this one?
these guys are a couple of sick puppies, Your Honor.
it's all here if you want to read it.
raise your right hand and repeat after me.
as the affiant, do you swear that everything...
contained in this affidavit is true...
to the best of your knowledge...
so help you God? - I do.
how's Sally? - She's great.
Mrs. Russo feeling better?
much better, thank you.
this is Bobby Keough, my new partner.
judge Russo. - Hi.
great. Thank you very much, sir.
appreciate it.
sign out a car and paint "Enola Gay" on the side...
because we're gonna drop the bomb on Holland.
take a look at these.
who's the female?
Beth Williamson-- LAPD Sergeant.
she's Holland's assistant.
who took them?
me.
some people call that "doggy-style.
I like "Bow wow wow.
call this one Girl on top.
wait. Who's wearing the high heels here?
and let's see. Oh, yeah. Missionary.
although I am not quite sure what religion that would be.
what do you want me to do with these?
stick them in Holland's mailbox.
then you're off till 21：00. Get some sack time.
you look like shit, Bobby.
I'll see you.
what's up with the blue suit?
public relations.
so people see everyone who wears it...
isn't like you, Detective.
would you like a menu?
why don't you tell Holland he's a great pimp?
what the hell are you talking about?
I think I was falling for you.
Yeah, I really do.
do you deny you're sleeping with him?
the secret files. The gossip.
the dirty little stories whispered...
in the men's rooms and hallways of Parker Center.
you're a part of that? - I know what happened.
he was my station house fling.
I was a patrol supervisor, and I was attracted to him.
I thought he was a great man.
it was a brief affair.
then he told me he wasn't leaving his wife.
that was five years ago.
we walked away like adults.
it's long over, and it is my business, his business...
and not yours or anyone else's.
Yeah, it is my business.
it is my business when you're spying on me.
you're the goddamn spy.
you work for Van Meter, not me.
who approached who first?
I never wanted to know anything about your work.
I never asked.
now... I know more than I want to.
what do you know?
chill, man.
honey, we're running late.
I want out of the marriage, Arthur.
listen.
please, just listen.
I'm glad the time you put into the department...
is paying off for you.
but the time I put into you isn't paying off for me.
I want to have a life while I still can.
don't worry. I'm still down for you, baby.
I think you'll make a wonderful Chief...
and I'll do my part to help you make it.
and when you do...
I don't see myself staying around.
I'm sorry.
that happened five years ago.
you know it. We dealt with it.
you said you would forgive me and try to forget.
it's hard to forget when you got a mailbox full of those.
I didn't know about those pictures.
LAPD doesn't miss a trick, does it?
is it possible to have a secret inside that department?
no.
Perry, you know the Xs and Os.
you'll be in the observation post in the alley.
you guys are lucky the verdicts didn't come in today...
or we'd be in the south end on standby.
it took my guys a day to locate these assholes...
and two more days to pat them down.
we finally tailed them into Charcoal Alley.
you know Bobby Keough, my number two on this one.
how you doing? - Yeah, I know Bobby.
congratulations on the shooting board.
you ever get tired of SlS, come down to Metro.
we could always use a good man.
that's not gonna happen, but thanks.
what do you say we hit the bricks?
what's going on, man? This ain't your style.
political as it gets, Rico.
they want this one on the front page...
so make as much noise as you want.
I'd like to introduce a member of our congregation...
who has spoken to us on many occasions...
assistant Los Angeles Police Chief Arthur Holland.
praise the Lord!
ladies, listen up.
Perry and Keough will give you some background on the players.
these are the two shitbirds that took out...
one of our dispatchers and a few other innocents.
no one fucks with our family.
and remember-- SlS doesn't have a jail...
so if you knock one of these pricks down...
make sure he stays down.
I remember one fine spring day...
about 25 years ago.
I had just graduated from the Police Academy.
I felt so proud with my brand new blues...
coming to church that Sunday.
I felt so proud with my new badge on my chest.
bottom line, gentlemen, watch your asses...
and pay attention to your fields of fire.
once we have secured the location...
we turn it over to Perry and his people.
sergeant, take over.
a couple of weeks ago...
some gentlemen from Cleveland called me.
they wanted me to move out to Ohio...
to become the Chief of their police department.
that opportunity is knocking mighty loud...
and my LAPD badge doesn't seem to glow anymore...
and I'm not as proud of my blues as I used to be.
today, I called those gentlemen in Cleveland...
and I told them I'm staying put.
questions?
we'll be pulling out in 15 minutes.
I stand before you tonight...
to declare my goal of becoming...
the first African-American Police Chief of Los Angeles.
what happens if they take these guys alive?
getting out alive isn't part of the drill.
no, I know.
for all I know, you'll hand these dicks your Roscoe...
and they'll shove it up your ass.
shut the fuck up about that. I'm serious.
shut the fuck up about it.
hate me right now? - You're damn right!
good. Stay in that zone.
what are you doing? - Calling the suspects.
Why?
making sure they're up. You can't shoot a man in bed.
Hey, dumb ass, take a look out your window.
the cops are crawling all over your place.
flash bang!
on the ground now! Get the fuck down!
all right! - Get your fucking hands up!
all right! I'm cool.
get the fuck down! Now!
take my piece. There you go. Here.
there you go. Safety's off.
you drill him, I'll take the heat.
who's that?
all right Hey!
take this worthless piece of shit down right now!
I never did shit to you.
shut up! - Be cool.
shut the fuck up! -I ain't got no gun.
go to work, Bobby! We're running out of time.
man, go to work! We're running out of time here!
I ain't got a gun. - What?
can' t beIieve it. They' re right on time.
let' s get these boys to their party.
mama!
man ON RADIO: It' s 10: 48 on Fat Tuesday, Mardi Gras.
now lets go back in time to 1964.
the Beach Boys on 105. 3 FM, the heart of New Orleans.
okay. Take it out wide. Give the pig some room.
my daughter's on that ferry. PIease. PIease.
Oh, God, my daughter!
do the other side?
ATF New OrIeans, Agent DonneIIy.
listen, caII New OrIeans PD.
I want aII surveiIIance from the AIgiers dock.
then caII City Transit.
I want the Crescent City Bridge surveiIIance, westbound between 10: 00 and 11: 00.
aII right, got it.
Hey. Seen an ATF agent around here?
Yeah, he went down beIow.
how do I get there?
the south side of the bridge.
you Agent Minuti?
Larry Minuti, ATF?
no, Larry's my partner. I'm Doug CarIin.
PauI Pryzwarra, FBI.
how you doing? -Where's Minuti?
on vacation.
not anymore. We're caIIing in haIf the region on this one.
you can reach him?
CARLIN: I tried. He's not picking up his phone.
weII, try harder. It's important.
obviousiy.
what are you Iooking for?
anything that doesn't beIong.
you want to give me a spot?
Yeah.
ANFO.
ammonium nitrate, water-soIubIe.
fueI oiI wouId have burned off during the bIast.
between the river and the rain, if ANFO was used, the onIy pIace you'd find it wouId be...
underneath this bridge.
that's right.
we can't ruIe out an accident at this point.
it's not officiaIIy a crime scene yet. - Here's a thought.
why don't we doubIe the perimeter so we don't have waII- to- waII traiIers down there?
ELKINS: No, we're gonna need aII our manpower for evidence controI and witness processing.
now, we need to keep it tight untiI we can determine that it is a crime investigation.
it is a crime investigation.
got a piece of eIectric bIasting cap and a strand of what appears to be Ieg wire.
about a miIIion of those bIue particIes washed up on the AIgiers side.
it's probabIy from a pIastic container or a barreI.
most IikeIy. There was post- bIast residue under the Crescent City Bridge.
the insuIation on the Ieg wire wiII inform us of who the manufacturer of the bIasting cap is.
then we go after the switching mechanism and the bomb's power source.
we probabIy don't need to wait for the Iab to teII us what we aIready know, that this is an expIosive and a trigger.
and you are?
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm Doug CarIin, ATF.
who's in charge? - We're working on that now.
gentiemen, pIease.
ed EIkins. I'm in charge.
Oh, good, good, good. - Yeah.
you're in charge, then? Okay.
first things first. Where's the coffeepot?
come on, this is a poIice investigation, right? Operation.
we gotta have a coffeepot.
Yeah, you'II find it in the back.
back there? - Yeah.
he is in charge. Thank you, gentIemen.
see anything?
traffic.
hit rewind for me.
Hey, did Larry caII?
stiII not answering his ceII. We Ieft another message.
aII right.
say, that girI ever get ahoId of you? - What girI?
you know, sexy voice, asked if you were taII, dark and handsome.
I gave her two out of three.
two out of three. That's very good. Hit pIay.
thank you.
Hey, Larry, this is Doug. How you doing?
listen, I know you're maybe stiII pissed off at me, but you need to get your behind down here, aII right?
Doug. - Yeah?
Doug, OrIeans Parish on Iine one. It's Sheriff Reed.
they puIIed a body out of the water, and they want a profiIe.
aII right, teII him they don't need a profiIe.
just teII him to bag it. I'II caII him back. - WOMAN: Okay, got it.
CARLIN: Put this on a candy wrapper?
it's aII I had.
cutting back, huh?
hoId it right there.
Yeah, this is ATF Agent Doug CarIin returning your caII.
my ceII number is 504- 555- 0130.
what's that?
KEVIN: Looks Iike a dude on a bike.
run it forward a IittIe bit.
stop right there.
what is he doing?
going to the bathroom?
run it forward, run it forward.
what time does it say? - 10: 4 7.
that's before the expIosion, isn't it? - Right before.
McCREADY: Can I have your attention, please?
thanks very much for coming.
im Jack McCready, special agent in charge of this investigation.
first, let me say our hearts go out to all of those affected by this tragedy.
early estimates place the number of casualties at 543 men, women and children.
now, Lord knows this city has seen its share of pain, but unlike Katrina, this disaster was not an act of nature.
after careful review of evidence retrieved at the scene, we have concluded this was a deliberate act of terrorism, and the President concurs with our assessment.
on our end, we have to ask for your patience, as the investigation will take time.
its a unique and complicated crime scene.
theres no baggage checks. Theres no flight data recorder.
there are maximum casualties, and most of the evidence is under 100 feet of muddy water.
there are no shortcuts.
Kevin, where' s Doug? - You just missed him.
weII, his car' s stiII here. - Took the streetcar.
what? Streetcar? - Hey, don't Iook at me.
it' s part of his process. He says it heIps him think.
sheriff Reed.
how you doing? It' s Doug CarIin returning your caII.
Hey, Doug. I know you got your hands fuII right now.
Yeah, that' s okay. What do you got for me, Bob?
weII, a coupIe of kids found a woman face down in the waters off AIgiers Point.
she was burned over 30% of her body.
right, weII, you' re gonna see a Iot of that over the next few weeks.
we've just set up ECC. Just have Crime Scene bag it for us.
well, we already done that. The bodys at the MEs right now.
crime Scene' s aIready been there?
Yeah, they' ve been and gone.
weII, exactIy what time did this woman wash up on shore?
kid caIIed it in at 10: 42 a. m.
you mean 11: 42, don' t you?
no, I mean 1 0: 42. I got the sheet right in front of me, and I got my reading gIasses on.
Phil: ImmediateIy evident is the focaI charring of the Iimbs and torso.
anterior face, neck and chest are intact, though swoIIen from apparent immersion in water.
hoId her hand for me, wiII you? Right here.
there we go.
each digit of the right hand has been severed between the middIe and distaI phaIanges. Thanks.
Angie of shearing indicates a singIe sharp- force trauma, possibIy caused by shrapneI.
no. No, it's too even to be shrapneI trauma.
posterior charring gives off a strong odor, suggesting perimortem immersion in burning fueI.
DieseI.
AcceIerant, maybe? - I don' t know.
if she was that cIose to the bomb, she probabIy wouIdn' t be Iaying here now.
what are you doing?
what are you doing?
you got a UV gun?
Yeah, on the tabIe behind you.
CARLIN: You see that? - Duct tape.
what' s that stippIing? You see that?
adhesive probabIy retained some substance against the water.
Yeah.
Yeah, go ahead.
I ran down those MPRs for you.
a CIaire Kuchever was reported missing this morning.
supposed to pick up her father from the airport, pulled a no- show.
okay.
aII right, PhiI, I want you to do a fuII autopsy.
concentrate on time and cause.
fuII spread of Iab tests. Everything.
just pretend Iike the ferry expIosion never happened today, okay?
AbsoIuteIy.
she' s beautifuI, huh? - Yeah.
very.
you' II need a photograph for your investigation, right?
there's pIenty in the house. PIenty to choose from.
Mr. Kuchever, I' m sorry about this, but I' m gonna need you to confirm your daughter' s identity.
okay.
now, anything that you can teII me about your daughter' s activities over the weekend, or any time, anything at aII, wiII be heIpfuI.
weII, I don' t know.
my fIight got in at 8: 00 a. m. this morning, and she was supposed to pick me up, but she wasn' t there.
I thought maybe she just oversIept, so I took a cab and I went straight to her house.
her and AIan' s car was gone, so I thought maybe she' d just finaIIy soId it.
who's AIan? - Her fiancé.
or ex- fiancé.
they broke up a few months ago.
and where is he now, AIan?
he moved to MontreaI. - Okay.
she was too good for him, anyway.
I got a sweater that she Ieft, if you want to take it.
no, that' s okay. But if you have keys to her house, I wouId appreciate it.
Oh, she had a date.
last night on the phone, she toId me that she was gonna meet someone, but she didn' t say who. Her friend Beth set it up.
Beth WaIsh. CIaire baby- sits her daughter, Abbey, sometimes.
okay.
thank you.
that' s good for now.
somebody' II be in touch.
agent CarIin?
Doug.
I want you to take these.
weII, that' s...
just go through them when you get a chance.
weII, it's reaIIy not necessary. - Yes, it is.
see, I know how these things go, Agent CarIin, and I need her to matter to you.
wo MAN: Monday, 7: 48 p. m.
KUCHEVER: Hi, Claire. Its Dad.
my flight gets in at 7: 55 tomorrow morning, so don' t stay up too late. Love you. Bye- bye.
woman: Tuesday, 9: 44 a. m.
Claire? Hi, it' s Beth. Are you there?
I' m sorry to call you so early, but you said you were gonna call me when you got home, and when you didnt, I started to get worried.
Claire: Beth, is this a joke? BETH: Oh, hey, hey! No.
like I said, I was just worried about you, that' s all.
I can' t talk right now. Someones here. I' ll call you later.
woman: Tuesday, 9: 50 a. m.
tuesday, 10: 04 a. m.
Claire, it' s Dad. I did say 7: 55, didn' t I?
I' m here at the airport, waiting for you.
if you' re not coming, I hope youre sending Beth or someone.
call me.
tuesday, 1: 18 p. m.
Yeah, this is ATF Agent Doug Carlin returning your call.
my cell number is 504- 555- 0130.
woman: Tuesday, 1: 18 p. m.
Yeah, this is A TF Agent Doug Carlin returning your call.
my cell number is 504- 555- 0130.
the bIast wave initiated here, hit the buIkhead and propagated fore and aft aIong the path of Ieast resistance untiI it hits this access hatch.
and that's where it gets reaIIy bad.
STALHUTH: The blast wave continues into the engine room, bursting the fuel tanks.
this utility shaft here acts like a chimney, draws the thermal components into the engine room, which ignites the fueI vapor, causing a secondary expIosion of far greater magnitude.
PRYZWARRA: EssentiaIIy, the initiaI device turns the whoIe ferry into a bomb and detonates it.
and so our earIy guess is that the bomb vehicIe was a minivan or SUV.
possibIy red or tan. - McCREADY: Make and modeI?
take weeks, maybe months. - I got a partiaI on the Iicense pIate.
shit.
check aII the SUVs and minivans that are registered in the state.
anything recentIy rented or purchased, anything tied to a theft or a missing persons report.
agent McCready? - Yeah.
Doug Carlin, ATF.
Oh, yeah. OkIahoma City.
right. That' s right.
this afternoon, I witnessed an autopsy of a young woman who washed up off the PoIand Wharf.
heavy fueI burns, traces of PETN on her face.
PETN, that' s the base expIosive used by domestic terrorists.
she aIso Iost severaI fingers in what appeared to be bIast damage.
appeared?
that' s right. I checked the tide tabIes against the position of the bIast.
for her to have washed up that earIy and that far upriver, she wouId've had to have been kiIIed two hours before the ferry expIoded.
before?
she died before the expIosion?
she died before the expIosion, yeah. Her name is Claire Kuchever.
she washed up before the expIosion and against the tide.
do you have a scenario? - Yes, I do.
I beIieve that somebody abducted her in her home, taped her mouth, bound her wrists, burned her aIive, dumped her in the river so she wouId appear to be just another disaster victim.
a disaster that hadn' t happened yet.
but the PETN teIIs us that the bomber came in direct contact with the victim.
you soIve her case, you soIve this case.
why this woman?
good question. Her SUV is missing.
it' s a tan and red Bronco.
it couId have been stoIen to drive the bomb to the ferry.
Oh, one more thing.
the victim caIIed the IocaI ATF office the morning of the expIosion.
Yeah.
we' II Iook into it. - Okay.
aII right.
okay.
Where's Larry?
what? - Larry Minuti, my partner.
that' s his car right there. Is he here?
I thought you said he was on vacation.
Yeah, that' s right.
what?
those cars were brought here from the AIgiers ferry parking Iot.
they' re the vehicIes that beIonged to the victims.
sorry.
so he' s a former Marine?
Yes, sir. Yeah. LocaI, too. He's born and bred in New OrIeans.
his famiIy stiII in the area?
Nope. Nothing, reaIIy, but his job.
you Iike him? - He' s smart.
Yeah, I Iike him, too.
aII right. Let' s go find him.
OkIahoma City.
Yeah.
you and Larry were cIose? - Yeah.
Yeah, you know, cIose enough to get on each other's nerves.
Doug, I' ve been put in charge of a newIy- formed investigative unit.
the ferry disaster is our first case, and I want you on the team.
why me?
we' ve got some unique time constraints.
I need someone who can Iook at a crime scene exactIy one time, teII us what' s missing, teII us what shouIdn' t be there, teII us what we can ignore and, especiaIIy, what we need to pursue.
aIso, you' re IocaI. You know the peopIe and you know the area.
but why an ATF guy?
why not? It' s your shot.
you want to find the guy who kiIIed Minuti, don' t you?
Yes, I do.
I guess you' ve got some questions.
for me to have questions, first I' d need to know something.
now I do have some questions.
don' t touch anything. We don' t need you yet.
Doug, you remember Dr. AIexander Denny.
where' s my audio?
compensating for audio deIay. Just a second.
compensating for a technicaI bIunder by a tech guy...
soIid stream. Minus four days, six hours, three minutes, 45 seconds.
GUNNARS: And 14 and a haIf nanoseconds.
DENNY: Okay.
anytime you want to jump in here, be my guest.
me? - Yeah.
what are we Iooking for?
you know, cIues, suspects, anything out of the norm.
when was this taken? - DENNY: Four and a haIf days ago.
Gunnars, try the guy with the backpack.
Oh, that' s tender.
I wish I had someone. Okay, widen out.
let' s cruise the car deck for a whiIe, see what we got.
how can you change the angIe on footage taken four and a haIf days ago?
PRYZWARRA: This is a digitaI recreation.
we' re combining aII the data we've got into one fIuid shot.
any angIe, any view within the target area.
okay, Iet' s cruise the breezeway, see what we get there.
PRYZWARRA: It' s a brand- new program.
it' s caIIed Snow White.
our primary data comes from seven orbiting sateIIites, but at any given time, as many as four are surveiIIing one area.
it' s Iike having muItipIe eyewitnesses, each with their own vantage point.
snow White?
weII, which one of the seven dwarfs can expIain to me how you get the audio?
I don' t understand.
why do you gotta Iook at four days ago?
why don' t you just fast- forward it to the day of the expIosion?
we have to wait. It takes four and a haIf days to render this singIe fIuid shot.
the onIy thing that matters is that we have exactIy one Iook at any one time.
Yeah. We can' t go back 1 0 minutes, you know?
can' t Iook back and see if there was a second gunman.
we can' t watch the agent buying 10 pairs of cargo pants in 1983.
aII right? But given enough Iead time, we can Iook anywhere within the target area, aII right?
it's the when that' s aIways constant. It' s aIways four days and six hours ago.
aIways. You understand?
it' s Iike a singIe traiIing moment of now, in the past.
okay. So if you can' t move forward or backward in time, how is it the image keeps speeding up Iike that?
it' s not the image that's moving faster, it' s just our shifting point of view.
the passage of time remains constant, but we can shift our point of view within the data stream as fast as we want.
you understand? - Yeah. Yeah. No.
Yeah, I know.
so four days from... WeII, actuaIIy, three days from now, since it' s after midnight, you'II be abIe to Iook back to the day of the expIosion, see who did it, how they did it and what they did it with.
Yeah, you got it.
the onIy thing is, you need to teII us where to Iook, cause, you know, we couId miss it.
PRYZWARRA: Besides, three days couId be too Iate.
he couId Ieave the country, couId strike again.
we need to do whatever we can now.
we know he' s out there pIanning this.
we just don' t know where to Iook.
so, Agent Carlin, where do we Iook?
Claire Kuchever' s house.
address is in range.
aII right, match the viewer settings to the signaI.
SignaI' s soIid. - DENNY: AII right, dazzIe me.
what?
you see, with Snow White we can track through waIIs.
it's part of the same infrared thermaI- imaging stuff they' re using in Iraq.
Claire: Hello. This is 877- 504- 8423.
PRYZWARRA: We trianguIate from four sateIIites, pick up the heat signaI and reconstruct.
basicaIIy, we can waIk through waIIs.
Alan: Claire? Hello? GUNNARS: Did you know her?
we heId hands once, but no, I didn' t know her.
Alan: Just checking in, wondering how youre doing.
Montreals fantastic, but my boss is an ass.
can you rotate the view, see what she' s Iooking at?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I want you to come visit, though.
the citys phenomenal. Youre gonna love it.
somebody got that? - Yeah.
Claire, you there?
listen, I' ve had a lot of time to think, and I need you to sell the Bronco as soon as possible.
or at least pay me back my half. I just really need the money.
I love you, honey. Call me.
unbelievable.
where' s she... Can you foIIow her? - No probIem.
Yeah, I' m coming, I' m coming.
what?
it' s StaIhuth, at that house you found. FemaIe murder victim, Claire?
right. What do you got?
we got some bIoody cotton swabs and gauze strips in the bathroom, some blood in the sink trap. And, oh, hey, Carlin?
man, when did you compIeteIy forget how to investigate a crime scene?
what do you mean?
this pIace is Iousy with your fingerprints.
they're aII over the pIace.
do me a favor. Just describe what you see for me, okay? Just humor me.
woman' s bedroom. Vanity mirror.
dressing tabIe with makeup, knick- knacks.
okay, okay, okay, I get it.
is there anybody there? Anybody brushing their teeth?
no. Just a coupIe agents, incIuding Hendricks, who' s bent over, and I have a fine view of the crack of his ass.
okay, I get the picture. TaIk to you Iater.
you satisfied?
she was supposed to go on a date the night before she died.
I want to get her appointment books and everything brought down here, you know, her phone records, credit cards, diaries, anything.
I wanna know everything there is to know about this woman.
weII, shouIdn' t we be concentrating on the ferry?
weII, yeah, it' s IikeIy that our guy cased the ferry first, but we don't know when.
we don' t even know what he Iooks Iike.
I mean, we couId stare him right in the face and not know it' s him.
but we wiII notice a change, even a smaII change, in her Iife.
Hey, Beth. - BETH: Claire.
that guy Ive been telling you about really wants to meet you.
okay. Tell him Ill meet him Monday night.
Monday.
BETH: How about Sunday if youre not doing anything?
no, Monday. - Great. I' ll give him your number.
no, do not give him my number. I' ll go meet him.
he' s not some psycho killer. - Who? Him who?
I don' t even know if I can do it Monday. Hang on.
show me the book.
monday works.
Damn! - Shit!
can we go back?
no. - SeriousIy?
no, it' s far too much data for any existing storage system.
it's a constant stream. There' s no rewind, no second chances.
we can record what we' re seeing, but we can' t go back and choose to Iook at something different.
okay. You said we can record, though?
SHANTI: Yes. - Okay.
teII me, is there any scientific or forensic insight IikeIy to be gained by spying on this woman in the shower?
Shanti, we' re trying to make sure the woman' s cIean.
aII right, why don't you, you know, Iook around the rest of the bathroom? Can you do that?
Gunnars. - Yeah.
you back? - Sorry.
aII right.
icy Hot, Band- Aids, baby oiI.
this woman needs a vice.
what's on the other side of that waII?
kitchen.
let' s take a Iook.
Hello? Hello?
maybe there' s someone out there. Maybe there' s a staIker.
someone there?
Hey, Ginger.
Hello?
does she know I' m here? Does she know we' re here?
no, impossibIe. StrictIy one- way.
you sure?
Hello?
okay, Iet' s check the perimeter.
GUNNARS: Nobody.
who' s watching her?
we are.
wo MAN ON TV: They will also take up a request for more money for the...
God, thank you for blessing me with this food and with my life.
I know todays gonna be a great day. Amen.
you guys singing? You singing a love song?
you singing a love song to one another?
what you doing?
Hi.
Yeah, its been a while.
everything God has done wiII remain forever.
there is nothing to add to it, nothing to take from it.
God has done this so that men shouId be in awe...
ex didn' t show.
wouId you?
minister: Whatever is has aIready been, and what wiII be has been before.
God caIIs forth the past.
Claire Ioved music.
there' s a church near our house, and gospeI fiIIs the neighborhood.
when she was IittIe, Claire saw a jazz funeraI procession.
she asked me that day, " Why do they aIways wait untiI the end to pIay the good music? "
Claire, honey, the music' s pIaying for you now and forever.
were there four Iimo drivers or five?
four Iimos. Must have been four drivers, right?
he was here.
address is in range.
PaIace Restaurant.
they got good food there.
waitress: Im so sorry for the wait. I really am.
listen...
your table will be ready in a few minutes.
drinks are on me, all right?
it is gonna be a few more minutes for your table...
go upstairs and see if Table 45 is ready for desserts.
all right? - MAN: I will.
hold on. Hang on. Hello? Hello?
man: Hey, are you the lady with the Bronco for sale?
that' s him. - How do you know?
that' s him. - WeII, caII up the phone Iist.
let' s see if it' s a number we' ve tracked.
Yes, that' s me. Just a second.
cover for me, all right?
keep that tape running, too.
I' m gonna want a recording of this conversation for voice anaIysis.
im here. Can you hear me? - MAN: Well, hello, there.
let me tell you, first off,
I' m what you could call a real motivated buyer.
I bet you are.
I' m ready to get something right away.
that sounds great. I need to sell something right away.
your price looks good, model, mileage...
so where can I come by and see it?
don' t teII him.
I' m at 82 7 Kings Oak, in the French Quarter.
need directions? - Now he knows where she Iives.
no, no, I' ll find you. Is tomorrow night good?
actually, I... Tomorrow night is not good.
tomorrow? - I' m going out tomorrow.
he wants to wait for the Iast possibIe moment to steaI her car, then it' s too Iate to report it.
how does Tuesday sound?
got it. 504- 555- 0147.
I see it. Tracking.
man: I think thats gonna be too late.
see, I need the vehicle Tuesday morning.
is there anyone else there that can show me the car?
no. Sorry. - He' s thinking.
I' ll tell you what. Theres a K5 Blazer...
a date means somebody' s gonna be expecting her and wiII miss her if she doesn' t show up.
that couId ruin his pIans. Shanti, I want to see this guy.
no good. It' s an outdoor phone booth. Three miIes out of range.
Claire: I hope to hear from you.
can we get someone out there with a goggIe rig?
what' s that do? Extend the range?
Yeah, it' s immediate Iine of sight.
but we can use it to gather data outside the target area.
provided there's any data to gather.
how Iong is this guy gonna be at the phone booth?
not Iong.
have a good night. - Thanks.
Bye.
story of my life.
Yeah, story of my Iife, too.
aII right, now we heard the voice of our bomber, now we' re gonna go after him the oId- fashioned way.
can we get video surveiIIance on that phone booth?
we can access aII surveiIIance avaiIabIe to any government agency.
okay, this is from the ATM camera across the street.
aII right. Let' s fast- forward to the exact time of his phone caII to Claire.
where are we supposed to be Iooking?
behind the guy on the Ieft.
can you enhance it, Gunnars?
GUNNARS: Not enough for an ID.
wait, go back. Can you rewind it just a IittIe bit?
stop. What is that on the ground?
looks Iike a camcorder bag, maybe.
we have faciaI recognition software? - Yeah.
let' s use it on the bag.
cross- match it to aII the bags on the south side of the city in the 48 hours Ieading up to the expIosion, aII right?
GUNNARS: Don't think it's ever been used this way.
Yeah, that' s kind of a simpIe image to go for a match.
weII, we got nowhere eIse to go.
PRYZWARRA: Look, same bag. - Bingo.
okay, freeze it.
Yeah, Iooks Iike the same guy, too. Where is this?
security camera at the AIgiers ferry dock.
okay, when is this?
two nights before the expIosion. Seven hours from now.
two nights before the expIosion is seven hours from now?
seven hours from now, we wiII be abIe to access this point in our time window.
CARLIN: Gotcha.
kind of creepy, seeing that Iady' s Iife go down in fIames.
Yep.
makes you appreciate Iife.
I suggest you go home and jump on whoever you got.
that's what I' m gonna do. - Nobody home.
How' d you Iet that happen?
everything you have, you Iose, right? Mother, father, gone.
good Iooks, Pryzwarra, gone.
loved ones gone in a second.
that' s what this job teaches you, doesn' t it?
no matter what, no matter how hard you grab onto something, you stiII Iose it, right?
weII, we' re gonna grab onto this guy in a coupIe hours.
we' re gonna naiI this son of a bitch.
what' s wrong?
no matter what, we stiII Iose her.
right?
wo MAN ON RADIO: ...dot- com for a link to the FEMA Web site.
man: Military helicopters that have served as an emergency force are leaving the city. Hundreds of thousands of New Orleans residents have been unable to come back home, and entire neighborhoods...
did you taIk to him?
...are still waiting to rebuild. This while governmental agencies...
girl: Oh, no. CLAIRE: What is it?
mom asked me to say a prayer for David this morning, but I forgot.
okay. - Mom is gonna be so mad at me.
she' s not gonna be mad at you. Come on.
well just say one now, all right?
it' s too late. - It' s never too late, sweetie.
well just pray that David had a good day, all right?
how about this? You pray for David, and I' ll pray for my mom, okay?
okay. - All right.
what' s going on? - Give it a second.
DENNY: Gunnars. - It's rebooting. It's coming back.
are we onIine? - Wait.
are we onIine? - Gunnars!
what the heII's going on? - Shanti, are we back onIine?
SHANTI: I don't know. Something broached the fieId.
what broached the fieId? - That broached the fieId, right there.
that broached the fieId, right there. That's what broached the fieId.
now, you wanna teII me what the heII this thing is?
it' s not surveiIIance, PauI. It' s not eIectronic thermaI imaging.
you guys have figured out a way to Iook into the past. Yes or no?
no. - You' re Iying.
you' re Iying, and you know it. - I' ve toId you everything I can.
she saw it, PauI. I pointed this thing at her just now, and she responded to it from four and a haIf days ago.
expIain that to me. - AII right.
CARLIN: Somebody expIain it!
hit it, Shanti.
for three years, Cambridge has been working for NationaI Reconnaissance on an R & D grant.
okay.
we were attempting to use concentrated bursts of energy to enhance the sensitivity of opticaI teIescopes.
in the process, we had a breakthrough.
given enough energy, we couId warp the very fabric of space.
I said expIain it to me, not taIk science.
they found a way to... - Look, I'II teII you what.
why don' t you guys just keep taIking? I' II just sit here untiI you figure out what it is you reaIIy wanna teII me.
they found a way to foId space back onto itseIf.
aII right, Iook. We' re used to viewing space as fIat, right?
like this piece of paper. - Right.
to see something from a distance, Iight has aIways had to traveI the Iong way across the fIat space in between.
but given what I was trying to expIain, we can foId the space, bring the target cIoser to us, create what' s known as an Einstein- Rosen bridge, otherwise known as a wormhoIe, suspend it via gravitationaI fieId.
that' s what we' re Iooking at? - That' s it.
what' s on the other end of the bridge?
Claire' s house.
Wow.
basicaIIy, we' re foIding space in a higher dimension to create an instantaneous Iink between two distant points.
Instantaneous? - WeII, that's what we hoped for and that's what we expected. But the eIectricaI force...
we used huge amounts of energy to create this bridge.
aII right, how huge?
you remember that IittIe bIackout we had a few years back?
Yes, I do. - New York bIamed Canada.
right. - Canada bIamed Michigan.
haIf the Northeast. You're saying you guys...
fifty miIIion homes. Right. - My bad.
weII, I stiII say we bIame Canada, but...
okay, so why can't I see this bridge?
it' s not visibIe to the human eye. I mean, it' s reaI, though.
it' s just as reaI and just as soIid as a ceII phone signaI or a radio wave.
right. WeII, I don' t know how a ceII phone works.
I just know how to use it. So how do we use this?
we can Iook back four and a haIf days.
and what, we can Iook anywhere? - Limited radius.
right, right, right. Looking into the past.
in a sense, we' re aIways Iooking in the past.
even Iight refIected from yourseIf in the mirror takes some time to refIect back.
let me get this straight.
you' re trying to teII me that on the other side of this bridge - is the actuaI past? - Yes.
Wow. - DENNY: Yeah. But Iook, Iook, Iook.
we created this thing by pure accident. AII right?
this space and time... This time window is a compIete fIuke.
aII right? And everybody is terrified of screwing with it for fear of Iosing it or suffering the consequences of God knows what, which is why it can onIy be used as a retroactive tooI...
Hey, Iet me ask you something. Is she aIive or is she dead?
you went to her funeraI, Doug. - I know that, but I think the question stiII appIies. Is she aIive or is she dead?
aII right. Life, Iike time and space, is not mereIy a IocaI phenomenon.
aII right!
am I asking a hard question?
looks Iike I picked a bad week to stop snorting hash.
aII right, I teII you what.
I'II speak sIow, so those of you with Ph. D.'s in the room can understand.
it... Here. Look. Here's a monitor, right?
now the monitor is broken. It's dead.
it is not temporariIy transitioned to another state of entropy.
it's dead, right? Now, is she aIive or is she dead?
she's aIive. - AII right.
now we're getting somewhere.
aII right, now, you said Iight couId go back. What eIse?
nothing. - Something eIse couId be sent back.
come on, PauI. Something. What? A body? A human being?
no. - Not a person. Not aIive, anyway.
why not? - Because you can't beat the physics.
the eIectromagnetic fieId. Look, you transition across what's known as the WheeIer Boundary, aII right?
an EM puIse annihiIates aII eIectricaI activity.
that's your heartbeat, that's brainwaves, that' s everything.
so what? You haven' t tried a person?
let' s just say that we' ve done enough tests to know that it' s not even possibIe.
it' s not even theoreticaIIy possibIe. The hamster goes back, dead.
a drosophiIa fIy, dead. - What about a radio signaI?
what about that? We couId send a radio...
a radio signaI? - Yeah, a radio signaI.
won' t work. EIectricaI. - The fieId wouId scrambIe it.
aII right, then a note, a warning note. - No.
a singIe piece of paper. One sheet. - No.
if we keep the mass Iow... - No!
this couId work! It couId work.
sure. We know where the guy' s gonna be.
we can apprehend him and put him away before he even bIows up the boat.
and how do we do that, exactIy? - We send it to ourseIves!
you send it to me. Yeah, send it to me. Send it to my office.
send it to my office four and a haIf days ago, an anonymous tip, and we can capture this guy before he even meets Claire.
we know he' s gonna be at the dock.
whatever you did, you did it aIready.
whether you send this note or you don't send this note, it doesn' t matter.
you cannot change the past. It' s physicaIIy impossibIe.
what if there' s more than physics?
okay. Something spirituaI, right?
Yeah, something spirituaI. - Okay, okay, okay. Look.
just try to think of it this way.
God's mind is made up about this. AII right?
I mean, you know, caII it fate, caII it destiny, whatever.
but it aIready happened, it wiII keep happening, - and it aIways wiII happen. - Maybe.
and why don' t we caII it fate, since we' re caIIing it something?
maybe you' re right. Maybe you guys are exactIy right. I don' t know.
aII I know is this. For aII of my career,
I' ve been trying to catch peopIe after they do something horribIe.
for once in my Iife,
I' d Iike to catch somebody before they do something horribIe.
aII right? Can you understand that?
address is in range.
two L's. " SurveiIIing " , two L's.
since this is such a tremendous waste of taxpayer money, the Ieast we couId do is get the speIIing right.
that' s not necessariIy true.
branching universe theory hoIds that you can do...
Oh, branching universe theory. - SHANTI: Look, hoId it. AII right.
no, no, no. - I' II show you.
the traditionaI view of time is Iinear,
Iike a river fIowing from the past toward the future.
but you can change the course of a river, right?
exactIy. Introduce a significant enough event at any point in this river and you create a new branch, stiII fIowing toward the future, but aIong a different route.
changed.
Yeah, but that river is the Mississippi, and we' re Iobbing what amounts to a pebbIe into it.
that' s a very few tiny rippIes in a kind of big body of water, don' t you think?
TraditionaIist.
say we do create this new branch.
what happens to the oId one? To this one?
ask the radicaI.
weII, it might continue paraIIeI to the new branch, but most IikeIy it ceases to exist.
the idea is, we cease to exist.
aII right? This version of us, anyway.
you know, we never came here. We didn' t meet Doug.
we don' t remember it ever happening.
weII, that' s worth $ 10 biIIion right there.
WouId' ve been a Iot faster if you'd written it yourseIf.
right. Then I recognize my own handwriting and the universe bIows up.
we' re ready.
aII right, third fIoor, southwest corner. That' s where we are.
MINUTI: Howd you get that information?
CARLIN: Good police work.
that' s me. I can hear me.
I don' t wanna play games with you. - Where am I?
im not playing games. - Yeah, you are.
no, Im not. - There are protocols... Yeah, you are.
there I am. - Is that Minuti?
theres procedures... - Yep. That's my partner, Larry.
look, I know how this job works, you know how this job works.
Jesus, I forgot aII about this part.
aII right, Iet's find a nice, happy pIace to push the note onto.
that your desk? - Yeah, that's my...
okay. Line us up.
when I peg a guy on a hunch, thats good police work, not some conspiracy to keep you out of the loop, all right?
you know what, Doug? - Okay, kid, start pushing.
expand the wave past the note.
if my memory serves me right, we better hurry up, cause I think I' m about to Ieave.
I need more cowbeII. - GUNNARS: I' m trying.
okay, well, I... - Good!
just give me a second.
don' t taIk to each other. - DENNY: Expand.
I' m about to Ieave.
...another partner? How about that? How about that?
everybody reIax. - Okay. Yeah.
let's go. - I'm working on it.
prepare for the finaI power surge. Ready?
have a good vacation. - AII right. Go, go, go!
walk away.
PRYZWARRA: What the heII happened?
DENNY: I don't know.
it doesn' t matter. Doesn' t matter. PuII it back!
did it go through? - I don' t know! I don' t know!
puII it back.
there it is. - It went through.
that' s right. - It' s through.
PRYZWARRA: It went through! SHANTI: Great.
whoa, whoa. No, wait a minute. Hang on.
it ain' t great yet. I don' t come back.
put it down, Larry. I' m not coming back.
put it down, Larry.
Larry, don' t do it.
foIIow him. - I' m on him.
aII right, Iook, Iet's... You know what? Let's cut away from Minuti.
the bomber' s on his way to the dock. He' s due there any minute.
we' II come back to Minuti when he gets there, aII right?
aII right.
okay, where is he?
can we circIe it?
we shouId be abIe to see him by now.
that' s him. There he is. AII right.
HoIy shit. - CARLIN: AII right.
move in on him reaI cIose. I want to see his... That' s him.
that' s him.
that's our guy. That's him. At the bridge, the cemetery, the ATM.
that' s our guy.
Shanti, see if you can get an ID, faciaI ID on him.
give me some time. - Okay. AII right. Take your time.
there' s your partner. - I see him.
CARLIN: Try to move in on his truck.
see if we can get a pIate.
no pIate. - Get back on him.
stay on him.
where' s Minuti?
federal agent! Turn the engine off!
turn the engine off!
tiIt back down.
GUNNARS: He' s stiII breathing.
what can we do? - I don' t know what to do.
he' s traveIing east. He' s traveIing out of range.
okay, what can we do? Anything? - I don't know,
well, it's obviously aimed at first-time visitors...
to create feelings of smallness, inadeguacy.
good thing it ain't working.
reed, what are we doing here? This guy's fast-food, strip-mall science.
this wasn't our first stop, in case you forgot.
besides, Victor's not that bad. He's just a little larger than life.
my research suggests that exposure to a high-energy cosmic storm...
borne on solar winds might have triggered the evolution of early planetary life.
ln six weeks, another cloud with the same elemental profile...
will pass Earth's orbit.
a study conducted in space could fundamentally advance our knowledge...
about the structure of the human genome, cure countless diseases...
extend human life, give kids a chance to live longer, stronger, healthier
turn it off, please.
l don't think l have explained my proposal fully.
no, l think you have.
same old Reed, always stretching, reaching for the stars...
with the weight of the world on his back.
but dreams don't pay the bills, do they?
you remember, when we were in school we talked about working together.
well, that's what l was about to explain.
the storm is deadly.
but the shields on your station's control room...
are designed to protect any occupants inside.
so it's not just my money you want.
lt's my toys.
tell me, if NASA doesn't trust you, then why should l?
that's my job, to stay a step ahead.
to know what other men don't.
l can't take this.
Ben, this is business, just work.
he's right, Ben. lt is just business.
l think you both know my Director of Genetic Research, Susan Storm.
one more thing he's got.
Hey, Susie. - Hey.
lt's so nice to see you. How's Debbie?
great. - Great.
how have you been? - Never better.
this isn't going to be a problem, is it?
no. - Not at all.
good.
then you're just in time to hear the great Reed Richards...
ask me for help.
you know, you made a lot of folks at MlT feel like a junior high science fair.
so you'll excuse me if l savour the moment.
you back this mission and l'll sign over a fair percentage of any application
and its applications and patents.
what about his first-born? - Ben...
come on.
25% of a billion is enough to keep the lights on for a while, isn't it?
maybe even pay off your fourth mortgage on the Baxter Building.
deal?
well, then. To our future.
together!
lt's funny how things turn out, isn't it?
hilarious.
he knew about NASA. Maybe he made the call to shut us down.
Ben, think about all the people we can help if this works.
look, we got what we wanted. That's enough.
a few days in space, it'll be great. What's the worst that can happen?
lf Reed's right, this little trip could double our stock offerings.
and if he's not... - Reed's always right.
good thing he doesn't always know what he's got.
reed, you should know those solar winds have been picking up speed.
l factored them into my coordinates.
right, of course you did. ln theory.
lt's a little different once you're out there.
l can assure you l - When are we leaving?
l'll be scheduling the launch...
so you can call me in the morning for resources and crew.
l think l remember the number. -lt's been changed.
as far as crew, l was hoping Ben could pilot the mission.
we already have a pilot on our payroll, but you're welcome to ride shotgun.
remember my brother, Johnny?
can't do it. Cannot do it.
external SRBs, orbital system engines, it's just like the shuttle you flew.
No! l cannot take orders from the underwear model.
come on now, Ben. - That wingnut washed out of NASA...
for sneaking two Victoria's Secret wannabes into a flight simulator.
youthful high spirits.
they crashed it into a wall. A flight simulator.
when have l ever asked you to do something...
you absolutely said you could not do?
five times.
l had it at four. -Well, this makes five.
attention, all personnel.
commencing launch sequence in six hours.
l miss you already, Debs.
captain on the bridge!
digital camera: $254. Memory stick: $59.
the look on your hard-ass former CO's face...
when he finds out he's your junior officer:
priceless.
thank you. That's so sweet.
l can handle the ship.
l can even handle Mr. Blond Ambition.
but l don't know whether l should be flying or doing Swan Lake in these suits.
l mean, who the hell came up with these? -Victor did.
the synthetics act as a second skin, adapting to your body's individual needs.
see, now that means it keeps the hot stuff hot...
and it keeps the cool stuff cool.
Wow. Fantastic.
material made from self-regulating unstable molecules.
l've been working on a formula for this.
great minds think alike.
here you go, Ben. - Thanks, sweetie.
reed.
ETA until cosmic event: nine hours.
lf you're good, maybe next time Daddy'll let you drive.
you keep talking and there won't be a next time.
long way from the projection booth at the Hayden Planetarium, isn't it?
Yes. Yes, it is.
we can monitor the cloud's approach and observe the tests from here.
ls it safe?
the shields on the station should protect us.
should?
what's the matter, Ben? Getting paranoid in your old age?
let's start loading those samples. Get your suit ready, Ben.
so l see you're still doing all the heavy lifting.
maybe you should have stayed in the lab. Fieldwork never suited you.
he does the talking, l do the walking. Got it?
so take a walk, Ben.
actually, if you'll all excuse me, l need to borrow Susan for a moment.
sure.
please tell me your guy's not trying to rekindle things with my sister again.
of course not. lt's strictly business.
Yes, well, his eyes say differently, don't they?
two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it, either.
wow, Dr. Phil, that's deep. Let's think about that.
you got Victor, more money than God, stud of the year.
and you got Reed, world's dumbest smart guy, worth less than a postage stamp.
that's a real toss-up.
don't trouble your tiny little mind.
don't wander off now, boy.
securing airlock chamber.
surprised l agreed to Reed's proposal?
l understand the business reasons.
well, when you're looking at your future...
it doesn't hurt to find closure about the past.
Susan, every man dreams he'll meet a woman he can give the world to.
ln my case, it's not just a metaphor.
opening viewing station shield.
that can't be right.
event threshold in T-minus 9 minutes, 4 7 seconds.
that's impossible. lt should be seven hours.
we've been together two years now.
lt's been a good two years, Victor. The company's accomplished so much.
right, of course, the company.
but, you see, l've come to realise that all the accomplishments in the world...
mean nothing without someone to share them with.
l've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps.
now it's time to take the biggest step of all.
Victor. - lf it helps, think of this as a promotion.
Victor, l-l have four words.
four little words that can change our lives forever.
the cloud is accelerating.
we've got minutes until it hits, not hours.
Victor, that storm is deadly. We need to abort.
get a grip, Reed. We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first glitch.
just close the shields.
Ben is still out there. - So reel him in.
but we came here to do a job, so let's do it guickly.
Victor, Reed's right. We have less than six minutes!
Ben, you need to get inside now. - What's going on?
l ain't done arranging your flowers yet, egghead.
Ben, turn around!
guys, l'm not gonna make it.
Ben, you gotta jump. lt's the only way!
what are you doing? - Closing the shields.
you can't just leave them out there. -Watch me.
you can't help them any more than l can. -l can try.
come on, Ben, you got it!
okay, Johnny, get ready to close the portal.
wake up. Ben.
rise and shine, big boy. How you feeling?
where am l?
back on Earth. We're in quarantine. Victor's medical facility.
Reed? Sue?
they're fine. Everybody else is fine.
what's wrong with me?
l swear to you, Ben. They've done everything humanly possible.
the best plastic surgeons in the world are here, Ben.
you had the best.
give me that mirror. -l don't know if that's a good idea.
they said the shock alone-- - l said give me that goddamn mirror!
okay, Ben, just be strong.
unfortunately, the doctors just couldn't do anything to fix your face.
Hi. - Hey.
nice do. l'm liking the grandpa look.
what?
how's she doing? - Stable and her vitals are strong.
blood panels show no irradiation. Good.
you'll step up this protocol every-- - Every four hours, yes.
we know what we're doing.
another day of observation and you're all clear.
excuse me. More flowers from Mr. Von Doom.
she's allergic to orchids.
put the sunflowers by her bed, they're her favourites.
well, Victor...
the bank would like to congratulate you...
on the fastest freefall since the Depression.
we can't even give your stock away.
Ned, you know l can turn this around.
well, you're going to have to, Victor, or we pull out.
you have a week.
you're enjoying this, aren't you, Ned?
one week.
where do we think we're going?
l don't know if we've noticed...
but the sickest runs this side of the Alps are right outside that window.
Yeah, l've noticed, but there are rules here.
you can't leave until we-- - Until we've finish the tests.
l know, l've never been good with rules. You let me know how those come out.
do you wanna help me with this zipper? - You know, this is not a ski resort.
not yet. Luckily, Grandma still sends care packages, though.
you know, it's amazing, for an 80-year-old woman, you'd be surprised...
you are trouble. - Trouble is my middle name.
you're hot!
well, l've never felt better in my life. My God, you smell good.
listen, when do you get off work?
4: 00, but l-- - Tell you what.
you meet me at 4: 01 at the top of the mountain.
that'll give you a minute to freshen up. This is yours, that's mine.
nurses!
how long was l out?
Hey.
three days. Man, l was worried about you.
how are you feeling? - Solid.
that was a close one, though, huh? - Yeah.
what was that about? - l don't know.
l really don't know.
l've been going over the figures again and again and they all add up.
l just don't understand. Maybe l should have aborted
reed, it was a freak of nature. You couldn't have possibly predicted it.
let it go.
you know, you live through something like this...
it really makes you appreciate having the right woman in your life.
Yeah, you and Debbie are perfect. - l'm not talking about Debbie.
what? Come on.
she's got a good thing with Victor.
he's smart, he's powerful, he's successful
well, maybe you should date him then.
Ben, she ended up with the right guy.
things worked out for the best.
do l have to do everything myself?
all right. l think you should stay to the right.
the left might give you trouble.
l think we should drop, like, 10 more feet. - Good.
last one down springs for room service!
that's my future wife.
you're losing!
all right, no more kid's stuff.
check this out.
you're on fire.
Thanks! You're pretty good, too.
no, you're on fire. Look!
care to join me?
l can only stay for one drink cause l have to meet Victor.
well, wouldn't want to keep Vic waiting.
reed, what are you doing here?
l thought...
great! Maybe you can join us.
lt's falling. We're looking at low 20s.
lt's a good number considering the fallout from
from Reed's disaster?
get me on the a. m. shows, Larry King, the cover of the Journal.
l have to do something about this scar.
make sure they only shoot me from my left side.
actually, the scar's tracking well.
people seem to think it humanises you.
and that's a good thing?
you know, maybe you should get some rest.
later.
first, l have some unfinished business.
a deal that needs closing.
sir, l have always wondered, why Sue?
you could have any other woman in the world.
that's why. Because l could have any other woman.
no, let me tell the story. - No, let him tell the story.
you all right? - Yeah, bad shrimp.
l think l better go lie down.
excuse me.
Oh, God!
so, you feeling better?
Yes, thank you.
good.
that's... good.
you always had a way with words.
Wow. l should be going because...
l have to meet Victor.
l'm really happy for you and Victor.
you're really happy for me and Victor?
l can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship.
which was? - Passion...
for science.
you're such a dork, Reed.
you never got it...
and you never will... - Well, what did l say?
...unless it's explained to you in guantum physics.
l just wanted to let you know that l
lt's been two years, and all you can say is that you're happy...
for me and some other guy?
Victor may be a lot of things.
but at least he's not afraid to fight for what he wants.
lt's nice to be wanted sometimes, Reed.
to be seen and heard.
look at me.
l can't.
what do you mean, you can't? Look at me!
sue, look at your hands!
Hey, you guys.
you are never gonna believe what just happened to me.
what?
well, l can explain this.
lt has to be the cloud. lt's fundamentally altered our DNA.
let's not jump to conclusions.
we need a massive amount of evidence before making that leap.
guys, look!
now, picture that, but everywhere.
lt was everywhere.
what?
the cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.
cool! - We need to find Ben.
and you know what, guys? l think l was flying.
l said, cut it out, Johnny.
l'm getting the hang of it.
Ben, it's Reed. - Stop.
all right. - All right?
Yes. - God!
God? -What's wrong with you?
what? - Sue, do you know the code?
l might.
Ben, open up.
you all right, Ben?
does somebody have keys to these doors?
anybody?
just break the glass. lt can't be that thick.
give me another couple of seconds, guys. l almost got it.
that's gross.
Ben?
look.
what is that thing?
what's going on?
what happened in here?
Victor, are you feeling all right?
l'm fine. Just a few scrapes, that's all.
Ben did this.
he's had some kind of reaction to exposure from the cloud.
we all have different symptoms.
symptoms?
Victor, l should have-- - Just find him.
anybody got any ideas where the big guy's going?
he's going home.
you gotta be kidding me.
little buttons.
Hello, Operator?
Hello? - Debs?
lt's me. - Ben?
are you all right? You sound a little different.
listen, l need you to come out front. - Out front?
you're home, baby?
Yeah.
l got a surprise for you.
Yeah, l got a little one for you, too.
Ben?
where are you?
l'm over here.
don't come any closer for a sec, okay?
lt's gonna be a bit of a shock.
honey, what's going on?
debs...
remember when we used to say...
together forever no matter what?
Yeah.
well...
baby, you're scaring me.
Oh, my God.
Deb, it's me. lt's still me.
lt was the accident. Let me explain.
No! Don't touch me! - Debs!
l'm calling the police.
everybody all right?
l saw him. lt's that guy over there!
okay, so he was there last night.
Debbie's gonna meet us on the other side of the bridge.
Yeah, Ben.
a few days in space. lt'll be great.
'what's the worst that could happen? "
Hey, little guy.
you're not afraid of me, are you?
perfect.
Thanks.
Hey!
you think you've got problems? You take a good look, pal.
how bad could it be, right?
l don't think you...
okay, pal. Take it easy. No, don't go out there.
look, l said stop, you fruitcake!
no. Come close.
that's further. Come closer.
l said, stop! No!
come here.
all right, calm down.
you wanna be scared?
fine! - No!
get back, everybody!
get back in your vehicle. We'll tell you when you can go.
what do we do now? -We're not going to get past these guys.
but you could.
sorry about the truck, pal. Come on.
a little help, here? You wanna hit the button, sir?
lt's stuck.
sue, your clothes. Lose them.
right.
this is so wrong.
wow, you've been working out. - Shut up!
all right.
all right, freeze!
now just...
just put the man in the seat down.
do it!
any more great ideas?
why don't you strip down and have a 100 people stare at you?
sue. - What?
l'm gonna need therapy.
come on, let's get out of here.
excuse me. Coming through.
and l want you to put your hands on your head...
954 approaching scene.
l still can't believe you made me do that.
we got through, didn't we? Just find Ben.
Ben!
mum.
stay here, okay?
l'm coming.
hold on.
hang on!
l got you.
get down on the ground.
get down on the ground now!
Ben.
l swear to you...
l will do everything in my power...
until there is not a breath left in me.
you're going to be Ben again.
l told you l felt fine.
where are your ears?
there are some folks outside that want to talk to you.
we're not going public with this.
we're scientists, not celebrities.
lt's too late, son.
look.
...when a New York Fire DePartment ladder truck...
see that?
...became part of the tragedy.
but the rescue itself is not the story.
one of the four stretched to an amaZing length...
that's what they're calling you. " The Fantastic Four. "
cool. - No, wait! Where are you going?
l'm gonna go talk to them.
no, we should think this through.
that's great. Brainstorm.
get back here, right now. Johnny!
settle down.
do you believe this?
which one of you is the leader?
that would be me.
no, seriously.
okay, son. You're on.
during our recent mission to the Von Doom space station...
we were exposed to as yet unidentified radioactive energy.
what happened on the bridge? - How can you stretch?
were you really on fire? - ls it true you can fly?
Yeah, l'm working on it. lt's actually really difficult.
no, actually, we do not know much more than you do at this point.
sir, Larry King just cancelled.
apparently, there's a bigger story.
actually, here they come now. You had to see it to believe it, folks.
the man....named The Fantastic Four...
we'll be going directly to our lab to diagnose our symPtoms.
symptoms? ls this some kind of disease?
no. lt's not a disease.
lf having special powers is a disease, then, yeah, we got it bad.
excuse me, that thing doesn't look so fantastic.
Ben Grimm is a genuine American hero.
what he means is, every team needs a mascot.
a new day is dawning. The day of The Fantastic Four.
look!
we went uP to sPace to find a way to understand DNA...
cure disease, save lives.
well, now it's our DNA, our disease, our lives on the line.
thank you. No more questions.
this is how you turn things around?
these freaks on the front page? Your company's in the obituaries?
l was planning to use the publicity.
the board's in agreement, the bank's lost enough already.
wait a minute. -l t's too late, Victor.
do you know how much money l've invested in this company?
Victor, stop.
this isn't a negotiation. lt's a notification.
we're pulling out.
ls all that for you, Dr. Richards?
l'm afraid so.
come on, Ben, smile. They want to like you, Ben. Say hi.
don't do drugs.
welcome back to the Baxter, Dr. Richards.
l've got the usual for you.
good to have you back, sir.
Thanks, Willie.
we had a tough year.
Yeah, like nine straight.
either we're moving really fast or not at all.
l'll take the stairs.
how come Ben can't turn it on and off like we can?
that's what we're here to find out.
l mean, if it happened to him...
what? You mean, like, we won't be able to turn it off, either?
that would save time.
you don't really wanna walk around on fire for the rest of your life, do you?
ls that a trick question? - Grow up.
come on. Am l the only guy who thinks this is cool?
we should stay here until we can define the extent of our changes...
and figure out how to reverse them.
but l have to warn you, it's gonna be a little crowded in some areas.
so, what do you think?
l don't know, Reed, l think you might be bringing your work home with you.
come on. Let me show you guys where you'll be staying.
busy guy.
Mr. Von Doom, would you like to comment on the recent failure of your lPO?
what about the rumours of a takeover?
God, l was so worried about you.
Victor. l'm sorry l didn't get a chance to call.
please.
no apologies.
l've arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos.
you'll have round-the-clock care.
thank you. That's very generous of you.
but l think l should stay here with my brother...
until we get a handle on things.
Susan, l think you should let my doctors have a look at you.
Victor, what are you doing here?
l'm starting to wonder the same thing.
how much do you know about what happened to you?
not much.
we need to run tests to see the extent of the damage.
well, you let me know what l can do. We're all in this together now.
Victor, wait.
l just wanted to say l'm sorry the mission didn't go as planned.
didn't go as planned? lt was a catastrophe.
you ruined the lives of four people.
with all due respect, we're both to blame. l told you to abort.
abort?
l put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line.
l will not let you make me look like a fool.
Victor, if we can understand
l don't wanna understand it! This isn't one of your science projects!
l just wanna fix it. Fast!
ls there a problem?
no.
no problem, Ben.
just pay your damn electric bill and get to work on finding a cure.
he's heating up from his core.
and his vitals are completely normal.
lf we're going to identify the source of the mutation...
we need to isolate your recombinant DNA...
so we can activate positional genomes.
we have to do a physical in order to see what got zapped.
why didn't you just say so?
his internal organs are completely solid.
how bad is it?
you know, l used to smoke.
lt's not invisibility per se.
you should be able to bend light around other objects, even people...
if you could control your emotional state better.
excuse me?
l'm saying, if you had a little more self-control, you could locate the trigger.
can you remember your exact emotions on the bridge?
anger.
rage.
frustration.
okay. ls there any way to duplicate that feeling?
some memory or...
l'm sure l can come up with something.
you feel anything? - Nope.
okay.
lt's hotter than l anticipated.
okay, Johnny, back it down. - l can go hotter!
Johnny, just back it down.
Johnny, back it down right now! - Johnny!
buzz kill! You guys are cramping my style.
Johnny, you were at 4, 000 Kelvin.
any hotter and you're approaching supernova.
sweet! - No, not sweet!
that's the temperature of the sun.
not only could you kill yourself...
but you could set fire to Earth's atmosphere...
and destroy all human life as we know it.
got it. Supernova: bad.
how's that coming?
l'm so sorry. Are you okay? - Yeah, fine.
you sure? - Yeah.
l...
you probably thought that was some form of latent hostility.
what in the world would give me that idea?
l mean, you broke up with me, right?
are you kidding? - No.
l distinctly remember, you walked out my door, ergo
l was ready for the next step, you weren't. Ergo, l walked.
l think it was a little bit more complicated than that.
l just wanted to share an apartment. What was so complicated about that?
there were a lot of variables to consider. - No, there weren't.
there was you and me. There were no variables, no math.
lt was actually the simplest thing in the world.
but like always, Reed, your head got in the way.
no, it didn't. - what was it?
did you feel anything when l left?
do you feel anything right now?
Hey, guys.
l think we have a serious problem.
so what's the prognosis?
your tissue, your organs, your entire biophysical structure is changing.
every system is still functioning somehow.
and it's changing into?
l don't really know.
some kind of organic-metallic alloy...
stronger than titanium or carbon steel, harder than diamonds.
like the shields Reed said would protect us.
how long?
at this rate, the infection could be complete in two, maybe three weeks.
what do you mean complete?
l wish l could tell you.
l can't pretend to know what we're dealing with here.
l'll have to notify the CDC.
what? - Centre for Disease Control.
l know what it is.
lf this thing is contagious, we may have a big problem on our hands.
we're talking about an epidemic here.
look at me.
l have a life.
l'm the face of a billion-dollar company.
we need to keep this confidential.
Victor, this disease is progressive, degenerative. l have to notify someone
that's terrible news.
but l think l'll get a second opinion.
our uniforms were exposed to the storm, like us.
so they can transform like us.
becoming invisible, changing size on demand or remaining impervious to flame.
you guys look like an '80s rock band.
you know, Ben, this material stretches.
l'm sure l can figure out a way to make it fit.
l wouldn't be caught dead wearing that.
l love these costumes. They're missing something, though. Needs, like, spice.
they're not costumes.
you can't use your powers in public, Johnny.
you guys are worse than NASA. - You could burn somebody.
maybe it's missing a utility belt.
here you go, there's your change.
can l help you, buddy?
Oh, my. - lt's Sue Storm, it's the lnvisible Woman!
sue Storm, it is you. Listen, my kid loves you!
l can't believe l'm doing this again.
reed, we really can't go outside anymore.
we are on the cover of every publication from People
all right, l'm here, let's make this quick. l got a lot of places to go today.
Oh, wait. l don't go anywhere.
Johnny, it's imperative that we stay inside for the foreseeable future.
l know, but when you said that last time, my brain heard " a week. "
Johnny, it's too dangerous for you to be in public.
you've been saying that for years.
what worries me is that our powers are evolving.
l know!
l am so close to flying, guys, l can taste it.
you can't fly. - Yet.
Johnny, can you put that napkin out?
Jesus.
so what's going on, Reed? How're you going to cure us?
l'm going to build a machine to recreate the storm.
the cosmic rays will travel from this generator to this chamber.
what, no pop-ups?
lf l can reverse the wave signal-- - lt'll return us back to normal.
right. But what are the risks?
even a small miscalculation could increase our symptoms exponentially...
or perhaps even kill us.
now, dying. That's bad, right?
l say we just let sleeping dogs lie, guys.
so how long till this contraption's up and running?
l don't know, it's hard to say. - How long, Reed?
l don't know. - You don't know?
you don't want this to get worse. - Worse than that?
guys, look, we're gonna be stuck here for a while, so let's just try and get along.
you could knock! - Sorry!
Johnny!
more bad news for Von Doom lndustries today as Ned Cecil announced...
that his grouP of investors would seek to gain control...
of Victor Von Doom 's numerous technology companies.
earlier, the lPO was Pulled from the market...
after the steady decline of its projected opening price.
von Doom lndustries was never able to overcome the negative publicity...
lnteresting.
Hello?
Victor?
what's with these lights, huh?
about the lPO, no hard feelings, right?
nothing personal.
you know, you could always move back to Latveria.
start fresh.
maybe that's where you belong, the old country.
nothing personal, Ned.
but l'm not going anywhere.
...assassinated the comPetition everywhere this season.
truly unbelievable. The crowd is going nuts here at the arena.
l tell you, if there's anybody out there who can do what these guys do...
we dare you to come on down here. Look at this sPread-eagle...
no arm, back of the seat. Motorbike grab, landed...
l got to get out of here.
Hey, pretty boy, let's see what you got.
Where's your hot sister and the monster?
let's go!
all right.
l want you all to make a lot of noise now for a very special guest.
Mr. Johnny Storm from The Fantastic Four!
look at that lift!
that was fantastic!
but, Johnny, come on. That's old school.
show us something new.
something new.
you got it.
come on, Johnny, come on!
ls he flying?
wait, no!
that's dangerous.
l'm okay, l'm all right, l'm good.
he's okay! He's all right!
Johnny Storm, ladies and gentlemen!
l have to give you ProPs, Johnny! You were on fire!
he didn't. - Oh, yes, he did.
flame Boy never listens. - What did he do to his uniform?
Johnny, l've gotta ask you about this outfit.
Yeah, it's sort of Armani meets astronaut.
so what are your superhero names?
they call me The Human Torch. Ladies call me Torch.
what about the rest of the team?
that's the lnvisible Girl. - Girl?
what about your leader, Reed Richards? l hear you call him Mr. Fantastic.
could've been worse. - l guess.
ls it true what they say about him that he can expand any part of his anatomy?
well, l've always found him to be a little limp.
what is that? What do you call that thing?
that's it. The Thing.
Yeah, you think this is bad, you should have seen him before.
okay. Now l'm gonna go kill him.
there he is.
Johnny! - Can we talk about this later, guys?
no. We can't talk about this later. - We can do this at home.
what are you thinking? - Where's my ride?
you think that's funny, Pebbles?
Johnny! - What?
you gave us names? You don't think.
so now you're the face of The Fantastic Four?
a face that's about to be broken!
look, this isn't permanent, Johnny.
we need to be careful until we're normal again.
what if l don't wanna be normal? l didn't turn into a monster!
Ben!
did you just...
Johnny, stop it.
that's it, Tinkerbell! -No, Ben.
you wanna fly? Then fly!
wait a minute, guys! Ben, don't do this!
let's see if we can get blood from a stone.
let's see. Bring it, burnout!
you two need a time-out!
talk to blockhead, he started it.
l don't care. Damn it, Johnny.
Ben, wait!
what?
you need to control yourself and think before you act.
Yeah, but see, that's your problem. You always think, you never act.
what if we got these powers for a reason? What if it's like some higher calling?
a higher calling? Like getting girls and making money?
ls there any higher?
you know what, Reed? This is who we are.
accept it.
or better yet, enjoy it.
wait, Ben, slow down. He didn't mean it.
you know Johnny. He's always been a hothead.
lt ain't him. lt's them !
l can't live like this.
just give Reed a little more time. You know how he works.
analysing every little step before he takes one.
lt's easy for you to be patient. - No, it's not!
l thought l was done waiting for Reed, but l...
we're all in this together, Ben. - Together?
Susie, look at me. You got no idea what l'd...
what l'd give to be invisible.
thank you, gentlemen.
l'm just gonna pick up a few things...
for some friends.
perfect.
that's not funny.
this is Ben Grimm here.
the first mook from Brooklyn to go into outer space.
so pay him some respect.
just give me the usual and l'm out.
all right.
make it a double. - Make it a triple.
put it on my tab, Ernie. - All right, Alicia.
appreciate it.
no problem.
lt's okay, Ben.
lf there's a God, he hates me.
she is not so into hate.
lf you could see me, you wouldn't be saying that.
then let me see you.
can l?
careful. - lt's okay.
so sad.
you know, being different isn't always a bad thing.
trust me. This ain't one of them times.
not if you don't want it to be.
all right, Ernie, l'm out of here. - l'll take you.
see you later, Benny.
l'm Alicia, by the way.
Thanks, Ernie.
reed got what he wanted.
and everything he wanted...
he took from me.
now it's time to take it back.
but first, l need to get rid of his bodyguard.
this seat taken?
what are you doing here?
l was worried about you.
you were worried about me? That's sweet.
come on. Let me buy you something to eat.
looks like you could use the company.
Reed?
l was just resting my eyes. - So l see.
the new readouts look very promising.
not promising enough.
when are the next tests?
l've run out of plans.
so l was thinking maybe...
there's always me.
no. lt's too soon.
Reed? - l should get back to work.
you need a break. - Sue, not now, please.
come on. Let's go.
remember our first date here?
God, l was nervous.
you know, l bribed the projectionist $10 to keep the place open late.
Really? l gave him $20.
no. - Yeah.
no way. - Yeah.
l didn't want that night to end.
you were right. lt wasn't complicated.
l just wasn't ready to...
you always talked about how you kind of liked the man...
who would approach you, speak his mind.
one who wasn't afraid to tell you exactly what he wanted.
l did.
but l wanted you to be that man.
well, why didn't you say something?
reed, l'm saying it now.
excuse me.
l know it's not easy.
life hasn't changed that much for Reed, Sue, or Johnny.
at least they can still go out in public. But for you...
lf you're trying to cheer me up, you're doing a hell of a job.
you know what l mean, Scarface?
l'm just saying l know what it's like to lose something that you love...
to see it slip away and know it's never coming back.
look.
reed is gonna fix me up, okay?
for your sake l hope you're right.
look, he's a brilliant man.
we should all trust that he's working as hard as he can.
you're his best friend.
so what possible reason could he have for taking his time?
l mean, other than spending more time with Sue.
wow, l had no idea. - lt's true.
Yeah.
l have that effect on people.
Ben.
so you remember my name now, do you?
do you also remember what you swore to do...
with every breath in your body?
we're working as hard as we can.
Yeah. l can tell.
Victor was right. - Victor?
Ben, l don't know if this thing will change us back or make us worse.
l need you to be patient for a little while longer.
reed, look at me!
l am looking. That's why l can't make a mistake.
l've gotta get it right and it's not right yet! We need to test it!
l spent my whole life protecting you, and for what?
so you can play Twister with your girlfriend...
while l'm the freak of the week?
Ben, stop it!
you stay out of this, Susie! - Stop it, or l will.
get off me, rubber boy!
you guys, guit it.
calm down!
good thing you're flexible enough to watch your own back.
cause l ain't doing it no more.
you two are on your own.
look what the marketing guys gave me.
look, check it out, listen. You're gonna love this.
lt's clobbering time!
lt's catchy, right?
lsn't that great?
that was the prototype.
Johnny, have you seen Ben? - Yeah, Sunshine just left.
look, Sue, l'm sorry. l can't stand this freak show.
l gotta get back to the real world. - You're calling that the real world?
sue, stop. You're not Mum. Don't talk to me like l'm a little boy, okay?
maybe l would if you stopped acting like one.
do you even hear yourself? Who do you think you are?
why is everyone on my ass? lf you guys are jealous, that's fine.
l didn't expect it to come from you, though.
you really think those people out there care about you?
you're just a fad to them, Johnny!
let's try something new. You live your life, l'll live mine.
sound good?
and just for the record, they love me!
Oh, God. Reed.
Oh, my God, Reed. What did you do?
l can make it work. - No!
l need more power to control the storm.
more power?
you need a doctor. Come with me. - Sue.
one more try... - You need to rest.
Leonard, bring me our lab rat.
Ben. Come in.
what is this? Where's Reed?
where do you think? With Sue.
l'll take it from here, Leonard.
Yes, sir.
what do you want, Vic?
to help you.
the machine is ready.
but Reed said it wouldn't
he also said we'd avoid that storm in space...
but we all know how that turned out.
he couldn't generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass.
yet another mistake for Mr. Fantastic.
and you can? - Yes.
tell me...
do you want to be Ben Grimm again?
thank you.
vic?
vic, it worked.
everyone thought l was safe behind those shields.
Oh, my God.
the machine worked for me. lt can work for you, too!
lt did, Ben. lt worked perfectly.
you planned this. - l've always wanted power.
now l have an unlimited supply.
and no Thing to stand in your way.
take a good look, Ben.
this is what a man looks like who embraces his destiny.
one down, three to go.
vic?
right on cue.
Ben?
what did you do? - Exactly what l said l would.
l built a better, stronger being.
and outsmarted the great Reed Richards.
lf you've exposed yourself to the storm, you're endangering your life.
you need help. - You always know best.
so tell me, what happens when you superheat rubber?
No!
Mr. Von Doom, are you okay?
never better, Jimmy.
why the long face? Let's talk in my office.
Ben.
sue!
Johnny, the machine worked!
give me a hand. Come on.
get his arm.
you all right, Ben? Put him on the step.
what happened, big guy? l leave you for five minutes...
the machine.
vic used it on himself. He was affected by the cloud like us.
Where's Reed? - Vic must have taken him.
Dr. Richards, allow me to begin your lesson.
chemistry 101 .
what happens to rubber when it's supercooled?
give up?
that's not like you, Reed.
after all, we're both doctors.
painful?
you don't know the meaning of the word.
just a little something from our defence contracts.
let's check in on the rest of the family, shall we?
we gotta get out of here!
wait a minute. l got an idea !
don't even think about it. - Never do.
what are you doing? Johnny, no!
come on, flame on!
we have to help Reed.
lt's too dangerous for you now. You have to stay here.
what did l do?
come on, think!
two down, two to go.
what has he done to you? - How romantic.
Victor, please.
call me Doom.
the machine works. lt worked on Ben, it can work on you. We can turn you back.
do you really think fate turned us into gods so we could refuse these gifts?
Victor, you always thought you were a god. Now back off.
Susan, let's not fight.
no. Let's.
Susan, you're fired!
Marco.
polo.
did you say goodbye to your brother Johnny?
lt's time to end this!
no, Vic. lt's clobbering time.
damn, l've been waiting to do that.
Susie, you okay?
Victor ain't that bad, huh?
'he's just a little larger than life, " right?
maybe next time you'll listen to me before...
Ben!
sorry, ladies. -Stop the car!
pull over. Hit the brakes!
this is the police.
put your hands uP and step down from the vehicle!
take him out!
ladies, l'm gonna need to borrow your car.
the transmission sticks. - Not gonna be a problem.
l can't let you do that!
Reed?
l'll be right with you.
Hello, Susan.
you three are pathetic.
you missed me.
had a little relapse, huh?
welcome back. - This is gonna be fun.
l can't hold it!
Johnny, supernova !
l thought we agreed that was bad.
now!
Ben! - Gotcha.
sue! Think you can contain it?
flame on, kid.
ls that the best you can do?
time for your lesson. Chem 101 .
what happens when you rapidly cool hot metal?
Ben!
you done good, kid.
come on.
sue, you okay?
Yeah.
man, l love this job.
job, huh?
well, we do have the suits.
ladies, your drinks.
l don't think we need another. - Just one more.
thank you, thank you so much. Cheers!
l need names and shots.
bartender!
they're custom-made, 36 EEEE.
well, look. l've been crunching the numbers on the machine.
and l think if l can rework the power settings
forget about it, egghead. l'm good as is.
better than good, baby.
you just need to work on your touch.
l like the sound of that.
can l talk to you for a second? - Sure.
Thanks.
l found a broken gasket from space.
a gasket?
reed, come on, we're at a party. - And if one of us were to wear it...
no more thinking.
no more variables.
sue Storm...
will you marry me?
sue, you kind of need to say something.
Yes.
that's my nose, genius. These are my lips.
she's kissing him.
that's so cute.
about time, you guys.
no more wisecracks about the way l look.
call me Mr. Sensitivity.
okay. Wide load coming through. Everybody move, he's huge.
come here, Mr. Sensitive. - Flame on.
showoff!
how long will it be?
what the hell was that?
what was what?
I'm referring to the enormous underwater explosion.
Alfonz? - What?
do you have any idea what this is?
I would guess it is a piece of a plate from Howard Johnson's.
do you have any idea what this is, buddy?
this is it.
this is it, man, this is what I've been looking for for eight years.
eight years.
huh?
Oh, good God. Oh, thank you.
Oh, baby, I knew you were here. Oh, yes, you are.
Where's the boat?
Where's the boat? - I don't know.
what, did somebody just take it?
I found it.
what do you mean? Where is it? - It will come to you.
Oh, no.
for some reason, I'm not entirely surprised.
Oh, no.
Hey, guys. - Get in.
you wanna know where the boat went. - It took us a minute to figure it out too.
you sunk it. - Listen, Curtis, forget the boat.
we found something. I mean, we found something.
Bigg Bunny spent some major bank on that leaky-ass piece of shit.
how come it sunk?
look, boats sink. I mean, nobody knows why.
can I show you what I found?
I think it was the compressor. - Don't help me.
I want them to know it was you who stole their money.
you didn't buy a new compressor?
it's okay if I take off now? - Yeah, man, we don't care about you.
Oh, you disloyal Ukrainian prick.
ho! Ho! Ho! Easy.
get in the damn boat.
Oh...
Oh...
what perfect hair.
what a perfect hairstyle.
Oh, my God, what perfect nails. Where did you get them done?
you did them yourself? Oh, my God.
they're so incredibly perfect.
like your incredibly perfect face, and your...
...perfect personality.
Ugh. Ooh.
that's nice.
Lillian, I've called Teddy and Purdy...
...and they're not going to tell their editors...
...not to publish stories about her.
it's how they make a living. Anyway...
...what about the other half-dozen bloody magazines...
...She's always appearing in half-clothed...
...and halfway on her way to the bloody halfway house?
crush them too?
no, no, no, I assure you that as soon as Gemma arrives...
...I have every intention of giving her a very firm talking-to, and I...
Hello? Oh...
my ex-wife.
Yes, sir.
was there something else, uh?
Tess. - I'm sorry. Tess, yes.
no, sir.
I just wanted to tell you how much I appreciate you accommodating me.
how did I do that?
you know, by agreeing to stop in Key West for my thing tomorrow.
your thing?
Oh, yes, I remember. Married, are you getting?
Oh, no.
divorced.
Oh.
your idea?
Yeah.
I don't mean to pry, just...
that's all right. I'll tell you all about it sometime.
if you like.
anyway, thanks again.
you're welcome.
I authorized $62, 581. 43 to fix that boat.
so where my money at?
Oh, God, I don't know, um... It's all over.
all over where?
the world.
all over the world?
the Caribbean, mainly.
hell, I was pretty much blown out...
...at just about every dive supplier south of Key West.
I don't believe this guy. - Look.
I used the money to pay off some old debts...
...which, if anything, should reassure you.
because now I owe you money, and you know that I'm good for it.
huh?
now, can we talk about the plate?
come on.
a plate from Howard Johnson's.
it is not a plate from Howard Johnson's, man.
that's got half the Vangor family crest stamped on the back of it.
and if you just let me get back down to my boat...
...all right, before my books rot, I'll prove it.
shit look more to me like half a Arby's logo or something.
look at the filigree scalloping on the rim.
do you understand what this means?
get his embezzling ass off my island.
fine.
can I have my shard back?
you ain't gonna need it.
so you do know what it means.
no, no, no, get...
you guys are making a big mistake.
Bigg Bunny is never gonna find the Aurelia without me.
you ever hear the expression, "miss by an inch, miss by a mile"?
it's a diving expression.
it means, you miss by an inch, you miss by a mile.
now, that wreck could be scattered over 20 miles, guys.
any last words?
Yeah.
tell Tess I love her.
okay.
who's Tess?
it's my wife.
at least she will be till 10: 00 tomorrow morning.
she's divorcing me...
...and I still don't know what I did wrong.
well, brother, you ain't never gonna find out, neither.
let's go. - Curtis, hold it, help.
help. Help!
Oh, shit.
Hey.
Hey. Don't move.
Oh, shit.
whoa. Whoa.
get him.
use the boat. Start the engine.
Oh, shit!
Whoo!
shit.
shit.
please, Lord, don't let me shoot off my foot.
okay, guys...
...wish me luck.
good luck, honey. Don't lose your nerve at the last minute.
she don't need her nerve, 10-to-1 the guy don't even show up.
why do you say that? - Because that's his nature.
what the hell do you know? - That's right.
defend that bastard and attack your friends who love you.
I've got no feelings.
I'm just saying you don't know anything about my marriage.
well, I heard enough. - Hmm.
do I comment on your love life?
you could, if I didn't happen to be the most fortunate guy in the world.
get out of here.
I just want you to have the happiness me and Eddie thank God for every day.
he's not exaggerating, either. We really do that.
apparently this makes me some kind of deranged animal.
you make it sound like I never meant anything to him.
all I said was the guy has a tendency to miss a lot of appointments.
behold this dude.
what's up?
Oh, my God, are you from Cuba?
lucky for you we happened along, my most superfluously toasted friend.
water, water.
it appears that you have run dry of the sacred nectar.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
all hail Neptune, and those who party on his mighty waves.
hail, Neptune. Whoo! - Hail, Neptune. Whoo!
decent rescue.
holy shit.
go faster. Whoo!
take a left right here.
I'll give him a few more minutes, Mr. McCintry...
...but if he's not here by a quarter past...
...I'll be forced to award everything to Mrs. Finnegan here...
...By default.
I'm gonna kill him. - Do you wanna go to prison?
if it gets me out of Florida?
honey, Florida didn't ruin your life. You did.
you married a guy for the sex, and then expected him to be smart.
Aah.
maybe he had car trouble.
car trouble?
Yeah. You know...
...car trouble.
he'd have to own a car...
...which he couldn't even if he wanted to because he has no money.
he has no credit.
he has no clue how to behave like a responsible adult.
Oh...
which is why I can't get a loan, because everything is in our name. Ha-ha.
I can't even pay for school and finish my degree...
...which is what I was doing in the first place...
...before I got dragged down here on spring break.
but like you said, the sex was really...
...really, really great.
do you have any idea how humiliating it is...
...to get divorced by yourself?
your Honor, this is a big mistake.
this woman...
...and I still love each other.
don't do this, Tess.
look, I know I messed up, all right?
but I'm willing to change in any area that you feel needs work.
I wanna make you happy.
I'll do anything.
I'll see a counselor.
will you come to Chicago with me like you promised?
could be... I mean, that could work.
I'll definitely see the counselor.
Mr. Finnegan...
...I can't tell you what a pleasure it is to inform you that under Florida law...
...you and this woman have been divorced for the last 50 or 60 seconds.
moreover, as you were not present at the time of the proceedings...
...she got everything.
we're divorced?
I'm afraid so.
Why?
excuse me.
Oh, wait, Tess. I gotta tell you what happened.
Tess.
we found it. Me and Alfonz.
about a hundred yards off the reef. Right where we always said she'd be.
Oh...
prove it.
excuse me, excuse me, you have a pen, paper?
anybody got a pen, pencil, paper, anything?
your uselessness is epic.
what does that mean? Here we go.
all right. Alfonz and I are diving...
...and I come across this plate, dinner plate, about yay big.
it's plain white...
...but this...
...was stamped on the back...
...in blue.
it's the Vangor family crest, Tess.
you were right all along. You were right before anybody.
where did you find this? - A hundred yards off the reef.
wow, Finn. Oh, my God.
that's what I'm saying.
Where's the plate?
well, I don't have it on me this minute.
where do you have it?
well, it's back there.
Wow.
Wow.
I know what you're thinking, Tess. But I swear to God it's the truth.
you can ask Alfonz.
okay. Where is he?
well, he's back there too.
I can't believe you would dangle this in front of me.
I can't believe it.
you really think I'd lie about this? - Why not? You're a liar.
but this is an inappropriate time to dwell on that.
you... I can draw this picture too.
Hey, Tess, I'm telling you, we solved a 300-year-old mystery yesterday.
married or not...
...if we don't go after that ship, it's gonna haunt us the rest of our lives.
I wasted eight years of my life on this bullshit.
I'm going back to Chicago. I'm gonna get my Ph. D...
...and I'm going to spend the rest of my life teaching, reading and writing books.
and somewhere in there I'm gonna meet an intelligent, successful man...
...who can get through an entire conversation without using "definitely.
first of all, I hardly ever say that anymore.
and when are you gonna stop selling this crap about going back to school?
you want history? It's under the ocean, lady.
what, are you telling me you wanna spend your life in some dark room...
...taking notes and writing books...
...about what some old putz in another room cooked up in his head...
...about things that you have actually seen...
...and touched and pulled out of the sand with your own hands?
bullshit.
I'm so glad we're not married anymore.
well, where are you gonna get the tuition money anyway?
that's the best part. By selling the boat.
by selling my boat, which belongs to me, which used to belong to us...
...but you missed the divorce so now it belongs to me.
I'm gonna fix it up, I'm gonna sell it, and I'm going back... What?
this is hard to say.
what is?
well, you act like this is totally my fault.
can I borrow this cane for a second, please?
Oh, come on, Tess. You're not gonna hit me.
Ugh.
sorry.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, God.
I take it they didn't kill you.
no...
...but thanks for your help.
you need help. - You are not my mother.
you're right.
I guess maybe I act like your mother sometimes because I never had one.
easy, Gary, easy.
okay, look, the main thing is we get away from Key West.
the second Finn lays eyes on this boat, he's gonna be onboard in 10 minutes.
what do you mean? You told him you're working here?
are you kidding? - Then I don't get it.
he needs money, Gary.
another boat, new equipment, everything.
and I doubt he's gonna squeeze another dime out of that Bugs Bunny.
bugs Bunny? - The rapper guy we had the fight about.
you mean Bigg Bunny Deenz? - Yeah.
Bigg Bunny Deenz is Finn's investor? - Yeah.
Hey, Gary? - He is a very dangerous guy.
I did like that one song he had, "Call Me Thumper.
that was some funny shit.
anyway... - There's something wrong with my bisque.
I'm sorry, honey. - Anyway...
but I don't get it, because has Finn ever even met Nigel?
no. But he will, don't you understand?
he is a genius at exactly three things:
treasure salving, finding money for treasure salving, and one other thing.
what other thing? - What other thing?
I don't wanna talk about it.
how do you plan to get another boat?
I can't think about this right now, Alfonz.
I just got divorced.
may I make a suggestion?
no.
you see that big yacht lying offshore?
no, which one?
the owner is Nigel Honeycutt.
so what? - I only mention it...
...because he is worth $ 700 million.
and just to let you know, I'm back onboard, obviously.
so whenever you want to weigh anchor is great.
thank you.
so should I tell the captain?
ready to weigh anchor? Ready to push off?
actually, no.
my daughter, Gemma, is joining us today...
...and I said I would wait here for her.
Oh, great. God.
when is she coming? Where is she coming from?
how far away is she? How great.
I sent the chopper to Miami...
...but she could be anywhere.
that's so funny that you would wait in Key West for her...
...when she's coming by chopper.
is it? - Well, just because the helicopter...
...could just meet the boat anywhere.
I mean, anywhere at all, that's what's so incredibly great about helicopters.
she wants to do some shopping.
what do you do, Tess?
I'm the new steward.
but what do you really do?
what makes you think I do anything besides stewarding?
stewing, stewarding, stewarding? Stewarding.
my infallible lifelong instinct for sizing people up.
have you sized me up?
not quite.
you don't mind the work, but you're not here for long.
you have a deep but not entirely unclouded love for the sea.
you perform your duties with superlative efficiency and ease...
...suggestive of someone expending approximately one-tenth...
...of her available brain power.
so...
...what do you do with the remaining 90 percent...
...when you're not getting divorced?
I hope I'm not being too personal.
no, not at... Not at all.
it's just been a crazy couple of years.
it's probably his helicopter.
his daughter is supposed to be arriving today.
the whole town is buzzing with excitement.
Hey, so where you say this, uh, museum is at?
number 2, Water Street.
okay, uh, every street on this island is called Water Street.
this place has a magic atmosphere.
will you just find the damn address, man?
yo, Cordell, we got MapQuest on these things?
Hi, Daddy. - Hello, darling.
Hello, my baby.
daddy.
pleasant flight? - Uh-huh.
so, um, is this the whole boat?
Yes. - Oh, so cute.
I can't believe we're at sea.
well, uh, technically, we're at anchor.
Oh, wait, okay. So that just means that the anchor is in the water, right?
Yes. - Yes.
okay. Because I totally wanna learn all the sea terms.
and so you shall, my darling.
okay, let me try again. Excuse me, Nigel.
Yes, my dear.
you know what, let's not do the accent thing.
it's no good?
it's fine.
um... Anyway...
Nigel, remember when you asked me this afternoon what I really did?
have fun shopping.
thank you, Daddy.
do try to keep it under 50 thousand.
what? Ha.
supper's at 7.
I was supposed to meet some friends, but I'm gonna try to get out of it.
invite them aboard if you like. Just let me know.
okay, I will. Love you.
my hat.
Hey, look. The hat, he is a Frisbee.
can you turn the boat around? Thank you.
okay, but we never gonna catch him.
Whoa!
God.
Oh, shit. - Oh.
Oh, my God. You killed him.
Ow. Ow. Ow.
what in God's name happened?
daddy, this man saved my life.
sir, sir...
...I really don't think you should get up until I make sure...
is this your hat?
Yes. Ha-ha.
that was the bravest thing I've ever seen in my life.
sir, thank you so much.
thank you.
thank you, indeed. - He'll be okay.
just a little bump on the head.
just try not to move around too much for the next few hours.
but I gotta go back to town. - Oh, I really don't advise it.
Oh...
now what am I gonna do?
uh...
may I suggest a hot shower, some clean clothes...
...and cocktails at 6: 30?
okay. Thanks.
take him to the Saint Regis.
whoa, whoa. Yep, yep, yep, I'm good. I'm good.
Hey, Mr. Honeycutt?
miss Honeycutt, she leave him on the boat.
Gemma. Your lifeline to civilization, darling.
Oh.
Oh, my God, I would have been so dead.
here you are, darling.
well, Mr. Deenz, I'm always delighted to welcome an entrant into my field...
...whether it be on land or sea.
but I feel I need to warn you.
there's no way of getting away from treasure...
...once it's fastened itself on your mind.
I want you to find me the Queen's Dowry.
Heh.
well, now, Bunny, uh... - Bigg Bunny. It's one word.
well, that's an emerald of a different color, isn't it?
Cordell.
this is a piece of the plate that we found in the Bahamas...
...off of Topsail Cay. Now, if you turn it over...
...you may notice that it has the Vangor family crest stamped on it.
that's what that is right there.
that's very nice, uh...
...but who the hell are the Vangors...
...and why the hell should I give a rat's ass about their family crest?
it's not an investment, per se, because you probably won't see a dime...
...but it's a chance to pull out a piece of living history...
...from the sand with your own two hands.
to the Aurelia.
Hey, babe.
what are you doing here?
have a good dinner.
Ugh!
I take it you've met.
so Tess and I first hooked up when we worked for this cat named Moe Fitch.
he's kind of a local character, you know, big talker, lot of tall tales...
...a lovable, old sea dog.
you should live to be so eccentric. - Ooh...
thank you, babe.
I do wish you would sit down.
Moe Fitch is the most respected and successful treasure salvor in the world.
nobody said he wasn't. - When Finn met Moe...
...he was repairing outboards and lawn mowers...
...during the brief intervals he wasn't getting fired.
two times, Tess. I got fired two times.
I'll be off in one second.
Moe picked him out of a puddle of motor oil and suntan lotion...
...gave him a job, a vocation, taught him everything he knows.
almost.
anyway, then they had a tremendous falling-out over this cannon we found...
on our day off.
from the Aurelia, three miles east of Vero Beach.
which the court ruled was Moe's, because we borrowed his equipment.
the sea is all attached, right?
to what, darling?
...and I thought we could hook up with them...
...instead of just sailing around doing nothing.
tell us about the treasure.
july 31 st, 1715.
a hurricane sinks the entire Spanish treasure fleet off the coast of Florida...
...including her flagship, the Capitana...
...which, according to its manifest, carried the Queen's Dowry.
forty chests of jewelry and gold crowns...
...especially crafted in the Orient for the new queen of Spain.
when we say jewels, we mean...
...Indian diamonds, Burmese rubies and Colombian emeralds the size of your fist.
we should probably start with what Tess and I got excited about on our honeymoon.
well, I think we can all guess.
after we lost the court case...
...we decided to go backpacking in Spain for two weeks.
ended up spending two years in the Archives of the Indies in Seville.
you spent your honeymoon in a library?
okay.
I love you. Oh, baby, I love you too.
where every known record, official transcript and royal decree...
...relating to the fleets has been kept for centuries.
at first it was for fun, but then we decided to look up the Aurelia...
...because of the cannon we'd found in Florida, and it became our pet project.
especially when we learned the captain was an 18-year-old kid named Sebastian Vangor.
who we also discovered was the illegitimate son...
...of Captain General Don Juan Ubilla of the Capitana...
...and his Mexican mistress, Francesca Vangor.
we thought it was an interesting sidebar and really didn't think much more of it...
...until Tess found this very obscure Spanish book published in 1905...
...titled, The vangors: An 18th Century Family.
it was a collection of letters. - So why is this important?
because the Vangors controlled the mule train that transported the Dowry...
...over the mountains from the Pacific to the Caribbean...
...and then loaded it onto Spanish galleons here in Veracruz.
so I'm reading this, and all of a sudden I start hyperventilating...
...because there it is right in front of me in Ubilla's last letter to Francesca.
he wrote:
my faith in the Aurelia is that she is swift and light...
...and can outrun the storms we will most certainly encounter.
but it is my faith in Sebastian that knows no bounds.
our son is good and strong and wiser than this old fool...
...who leaves your bed more and more reluctantly.
the glory of the Spanish Crown rests in his capable hands.
so...
...Ubilla pulled a switch.
Mm. - With the Vangors' help.
and moved the Queen's Dowry from the Capitana to the supply ship.
because?
the Capitana was already way overloaded...
...so it was very heavy and very slow.
it wasn't just hurricanes they had to worry about.
british warships, French privateers, you name it.
about the time Finn and I were ready to leave, we found this article...
...about a Spanish sailor who was rescued off a deserted island...
...after being shipwrecked for three years.
off Topsail Cay?
right. 1718. - Three years after the hurricane.
a Dutch frigate had come to grief on the shoals off of Topsail Cay...
...and while waiting for the tide to rise...
...they saw what they thought was an old man paddling out on a log.
only he wasn't an old man. He was 21 years old.
looked like Tom Hanks in that movie. What was that movie?
um...
cast Away. - Ha-ha.
Yes. - Ha-ha.
he told the Dutch captain his name was Raphael Serrano...
...of the tobacco ship Francesca.
ha. As in mother of Sebastian.
Yes. - Exactly.
now, he said...
...he had struck the same reef and sunk in just 30 feet of water.
Wow.
you guys must really like treasure.
Yes. I mean, it's very impressive...
...but it's still thin.
Oh, my God. - Only Francesca...
...she didn't sink off Topsail Cay.
she sank off the coast of Veracruz in 1708...
...with all hands, including her captain, Raphael Serrano.
wait, I don't get it. - Neither did we.
until we discovered the Francesca had been owned by the Vangor family.
Yeah.
so, what do we know about Sebastian Vangor?
well, we know for a fact that he survived a hurricane, a shipwreck...
...starvation, pirates, most likely, and then he lied about it.
now, why lie about being part of the greatest treasure fleet in history?
unless you're sitting on top of a huge secret.
a secret that nobody, not even the king of Spain, knew existed.
well, I can think of only one reason:
honor.
because his father had entrusted him...
...with precious gifts mankind had never seen...
...he had to survive to fulfill the privilege...
...Ubilla had bestowed on him that fateful day in Veracruz.
that's why he lied.
that's why he lived.
and that's why we can't give up.
Sebastian Vangor is the unsung hero of an entire nation...
...and we intend to prove it.
so, what happened to him? - Sebastian?
he was taken off the Dutch ship in Martinique...
...and died a week later of consumption. - Oh...
he drank too much?
no. Um... Consumption, darling. As in tuberculosis.
not to be confused with consuming, as in guzzling.
Oh, man. I'm so dumb.
huh. You wanna hear dumb?
I used to think that it meant he died having sex, as in consummating.
you did? - Yeah.
you did?
Yeah.
Really? - Mm-hm.
anyway, that's our idea.
it's Tess' mostly, she was always the brains of the operation.
well, Gemma? What do you think?
you're asking me?
I am.
a treasure hunt in the Bahamas?
will you teach me how to dive?
Yes, I will.
Tess. - Hey, Alfonz.
long time. - This is Mr. Nigel Honeycutt. Alfonz.
welcome aboard.
this is Gemma Honeycutt. Alfonz.
pleased to meet you.
like that.
there you go. - Thank you.
and... Whoa.
okay. Okay.
now, the island is basically triangular.
you got cliffs and breakers, harbor and town, and beach.
now, I found the plate near the reef just on the other side.
but you haven't got the exact coordinates?
the exact position of the find is irrelevant.
Why? - We, uh, kind of left a marker.
we set the boat on fire, and then we sank it.
but we would never do that to your boat. - Nope, just my boat.
our boat. - My boat.
our boat. - My boat.
Hey, did you know that this entire island is owned by Bigg Bunny Deenz?
who? - He owns the whole island?
Bigg Bunny Deenz.
Oh, yes, I remember.
didn't he murder someone named Fuzzy Dice...
...or Pogo Stick or something?
his name was Exta-C.
you're really close.
and he was totally acquitted.
well, it was difficult to secure a conviction because he murdered all the witnesses.
you are really incredible, Finn.
okay, so he owns the island. So what? He doesn't own the water.
and how's he gonna feel when we're hauling treasure up out of the water...
...in front of his beach house?
supportive? - I told you not to get involved with him.
what if we need food or fuel or flashlight batteries?
will you relax, Tess?
it's Aurelia.
she's right around the corner, and she's all ours.
Hey, guys. Come look at this boat.
it's got these really big, um, tubes going in the water off the back.
is that where you found the plate?
man, oh, man.
anybody but me wanna spend a weekend in Paris with that boat?
I think she's already taken. - What?
Oh, you son of a...
bitch.
what's the matter? - It's Moe.
what? - What is it?
what's happened? - I'm pretty sure hell just froze over.
well, don't that just beat all.
the Aurelia's mine, goddamn it.
not if I find her first.
looks like he's only been here a day or two.
how can you tell? - It's a full day's work to lay the grid.
but... So, what are they looking for?
do you really not know the answer to that?
darling.
huh.
Oh...
I will go comfort her. - No, you stay there.
I'm sorry, but she's gotta learn...
...there's better ways to get attention than acting like a bimbo.
like what?
ahoy there. Good morning.
morning to you. That's quite a bucket you got there.
Hello, Moe.
Hey, darling. - Small world, huh?
Where's that good-for-nothing husband?
ex-husband. - Congratulations.
find anything yet, Mr. Fitch?
well, sir, we're just gonna set off some charges and take a look.
you might wanna ease back a ways just in case we accidentally scratch your finish.
I'll tell the captain.
let's blow some holes.
come on. I'm getting old, let's find some gold.
Oh, my God.
what? - Delay, delay.
uh, excuse me, Moe?
well, well, well. If it isn't the Ukrainian sidekick.
I don't think of myself that way.
I am the lead character in my own story. Ha.
but why does everyone I know think I'm hot except the ones on this boat?
we think you're hot.
are you kidding me? - I know I do.
Gemma. I need your help. No time to explain.
what do you want? Some expert advice on how to be stupid?
Oh...
look. See how dumb they are?
Yeah.
they can't help it. You can. The end.
let's go.
okay. - Okay, you're on.
okay. - All right, go, go, go.
Hi.
Hi. I'm Gemma.
it's Gemma Honeycutt. - Are you serious?
it's Gemma Honeycutt.
Hi. What are your names? Oh. - I'm Happy.
I'm Jim. - Hi.
Hi. - Petruchio, eh.
so did you all grow up on this boat?
Oh! Oh, my God, there's Finn. - Gemma.
goddamn bastard. I'll get that little shit out of there myself.
what, are you crazy, Moe?
who the hell set off that charge? There's a man down there.
what the hell? - Right over here.
he ripped up the grid. Nobody rips the grid.
anybody gonna kill that boy, it's gonna be me.
okay.
Finn?
Hey, honey. - Ha-ha-ha!
you go, girl. - I'll be right over.
Hey.
Bravo. Bravo.
Oh, shit.
Oh, hello, Moe.
Hello, Finn. Anything broke?
I don't think so. - Good.
Finn! - Finn! Oh!
is that all you got, old man?
it's difficult to maintain enthusiasm for your leadership...
...when you keep getting beat up by that old man.
he's 56 years old.
I can't hit him.
that's quite obvious.
was that a yellow and white Cessna 206 seaplane?
I would describe it more as banana and cream.
I still can't get over the way he just came up out of the water like that.
I know, and holding the sword.
and then he just makes this totally perfect toss...
...and the sword ends up sticking straight up in the deck.
amazing.
but it's more than just the sheer power of his raw sexuality.
it's a totality of his emotional commitment to the task at hand.
Yeah, it's the focus. It's the focus.
he sees it. He wants it.
he goes after it. He gets it. - He sure got me.
do you mind?
I'm sorry. - We're sorry.
well...
here's to a wonderfully exciting first day...
...and to the safe landing of our glorious leader.
hear, says I. Hear, hear, Nigel. You the man.
no, he meant you, stupid.
what?
no, Finn, honey, Finn. - Oh.
there's port in the salon if anyone's interested...
...and a wonderful selection of cigars...
...if anyone feels like ruining the evening for the rest of us...
...and cupcakes.
are there any prostitutes?
sorry. No.
well, maybe we can call some.
Oh. My God, are you serious?
pay him no attention, Gemma, he's a provocateur.
okay, but we're not in France right now, we're in America.
think I'm gonna head to bed. - That's it for me tonight.
a coincidence that we got up together, and we're both going to bed...
...because we're not going to bed together.
obviously. - No.
well, it's really none of our business.
or even interesting.
what she's trying to say... - Good night.
good night.
good night.
Nigel, great day. Gemma, sweet dreams.
good night, sir. - Good night, Tess.
I hope...
I hope, Gemma...
...it hasn't been too dull for you here.
of course not, Daddy. It's been really fun.
Yes.
do you still play gin rummy?
Oh, my God, all the time. Whenever I fly.
Oh. Penny a point?
Hey, it's Tess.
don't get the wrong idea, I just, uh, wanna talk. Um...
I just thought, since I've been kind of critical recently...
...maybe I should tell you how magnificent you were today...
...you know, taking out their grid and...
you couldn't hit Moe back.
uh, it just reminded me of how...
are you in here?
Oh.
gin.
what?
hundred and five.
twenty-eight thousand.
dollars? - Well, it's all going to charity, Daddy.
well, darling, I'm very pleased you've inherited...
...not only your mother's beauty and na? ve charm...
...but also her singular talent for getting huge sums of money out of me...
...with a modicum of effort.
what's wrong?
I don't want it.
I'm sorry. It was a joke.
I mean, be honest...
...she didn't exactly marry me for love, did she?
my mother...
...was a 24-year-old blackjack dealer from Nebraska.
you had to tip her $500 just to have a drink with you.
you got married two weeks later at the age of 175.
51 to be precise. - Now you're mad...
...because she had the brains to get some money before you dumped her?
no, I'm mad about the amount.
Oh, well, okay, you can have mine. Because I'm cutting myself off.
I don't want anything from you anymore.
except for food. And clothes.
and rent and, like, travel.
and I'm totally serious.
Yes, that's what is so frightening about it.
Gemma?
for what it's worth...
...I loved your mother, and I love you.
you believe in ghosts, Curtis?
you know what, you are some kind of stupid.
now you sound like my wife.
bunny around?
you know, I can't hear you, you talking to my deaf ear.
Oh, sorry.
Curtis?
take me to see Bigg Bunny.
Bigg Bunny ain't never wanna find out you didn't drown the first time.
okay.
shit.
when's the last time you had this thing sharpened?
1715
okay, okay, okay, one second.
now look, 20 people saw me today, everybody on Moe's boat.
now if you guys take me to Bigg Bunny...
...It's gonna look a lot better than if he finds out I'm alive from someone else.
it ain't his decision no more. - Now, who in the hell are you?
Ow.
ain't no fool like a gold fool.
ain't that right, Mr. Finnegan?
who's the new guy?
this here is Cyrus. He's my new, uh, chief of staff.
he's helping me to refocus, reform, and renew.
what do you need him for, huh? We handling it.
Whoa! Whoa, whoa!
God, jeez. What's the...?
why'd you do that?
just a little restructure.
see, you let this boy get past you not just once, but twice.
so I hope you focused now.
Oh, extremely focused. Very motivated.
my morale probably 20 percent higher than when I came in here.
can I get a word in? - What? What do you want?
I wanna buy some time.
you still breathing, ain't you?
Yeah, thank you.
now, hear me out.
all right, the way I see it, you bet on Moe, you got a fifty-fifty chance...
...but you bet on the both of us, and we cover twice the ground in half the time...
...and I'm willing to give you 10 percent of everything I find.
plus what I already owe you, of course.
how much you say?
ten percent, across-the-board.
ten percent, huh?
Wow.
say it again. - Come on, what...?
you know, 12 percent's cool.
you know, I couldn't even hear you. What you say?
fifteen percent, but I gotta find... - I'm sorry, how much?
eighteen, but I owe other people. - That don't sound right.
twenty percent, but that's it, final. - Oh.
damn it. What? How much do you want?
I'll tell you what.
you find the treasure and I won't kill you.
how much do you owe him? - Whoa.
Jesus, Tess.
how much do you owe him?
owe who? Owe who what?
Bigg Bunny.
I don't owe him any money.
Finn, how much do you owe him?
just tell me so I'll know.
Oh, God, Tess. I mean, that's so hard to be specific about.
it's a really complex payment schedule... - How much?
sixty-two thousand, five hundred and eighty-one dollars and forty-three cents.
but we're good now.
is there a reason you didn't tell me this before?
Yeah.
you wouldn't have come.
Yeah, I would.
just wouldn't have come with you.
are we finished?
we sure are.
you good? - Yeah.
okay.
what happened to your face?
somebody hit me with a cricket bat.
Ah.
this is a new type of regulator... - Shove it up your ass.
all right, we're good to go. - Ready, darling?
drop dead.
this is just like the old days, huh?
Hello, darling.
drink?
I have one.
you know what else is really bugging me?
no.
please, tell us. Because I may personally drop dead from disappointment...
...if I don't find out the 700-millionth thing about life on planet Earth...
...that is bugging you.
well, this is fun.
no, listen.
if I am the Dutch frigate stuck on a reef in a dead calm...
...in the same cove the Aurelia sank three years earlier...
...in less than 30 feet of the clearest water in the world...
then how come I can't see her?
because she isn't there.
Yeah, I don't know.
no, no, no. Sebastian specifically said that's where she sank.
and he said it. - Yeah.
my dear children, your entire theory is predicated on the proposition...
...that Sebastian lied about everything he could to prevent the ship being found.
so why on Earth would he tell the truth about where she sank?
I mean, it seems to me that the Aurelia can't be in the cove...
...for the simple reason that that's where Sebastian said she was.
sorry to disturb.
we've had to move to the lee side on account of the storm.
she won't fit in the marina?
afraid not. A taxi will take you to the beach on the north end.
call, we'll pick you up on the launch. - Better safe than sorry.
sir.
I've grown rather fond of not sinking.
Ugh. Don't even say that.
Oh, it would be a shame to lose the art collection.
or Gemma's shoes.
especially because we're so close to shore, you know?
Oh, my God.
what?
Oh, my God, of course.
of course what?
you are a genius.
Stefan.
Stefan. - Yes.
why did you pick the north beach?
I didn't. It's the only beach on the island not blocked by the reef.
Yes. Yes. He ran her aground.
what are you so happy about?
he ran her aground. - What?
to save the Dowry. Sebastian ran the whole goddamn thing aground.
bet you $ 1000 I find something between here and that beach.
you don't have $ 1000.
fine, make it 10.
you don't have $ 10.
fine, make it a million.
what are you doing?
you think I'm letting you go out there alone, you're crazy.
what, you don't trust me?
why on Earth would I trust you?
huh.
I found a cannon. - I found a cannon.
you did what? - You mean there's two?
there's two cannons. - Aah!
and I owe you a million dollars. Aah! - Yes, you do. Oh!
Whoo!
we got the Aurelia, baby!
listen to me, if anybody finds out about this outside of our crew, we are screwed.
Wow. Can't you just enjoy this for a second?
Oh, I'm enjoying it.
Oh, God. Thank God.
Whoo-hoo!
well, there's not much here.
now, they probably burned the ship and took everything inland.
look, a pistol. Cool.
all right, well, what do we know about Topsail Cay?
we got the town, the church...
there's Preacher's Cave.
we were up there once. It said something about first settlers...
...religious freedom...
God, I think that is just so important.
Yeah, but that was like...
Oh. - Like 1780-something.
I mean, Sebastian beat them here by almost 70 years.
if there are any records, they're in the church.
letters, journals, sermons. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
that's smart, Tess.
it's the oldest building on the island.
Yeah. - Hmm.
when Moe finds out we're gone...
...he's gonna come barreling up your ass like a freight train.
Oh, my, that ought to be interesting.
well, I'm just saying we don't have much time.
Oh, my God.
stop the boat!
I just figured it out. It's been right in front of us this whole time.
what?
precious Gem.
Yes.
well, do you realize how incredibly similar the word "gem" is to "Gemma"?
uh... I thought I did.
my God.
daddy, you named the boat after me and didn't even know it.
I didn't?
don't you see?
you were running away to sea, only you wanted to bring me along.
so you unconsciously named the boat after me.
that is so beautiful.
of course I named it for you, Gemma.
but it wasn't unconscious. I gave it a lot of thought.
no. You did it unconsciously.
and then I did it unconsciously.
good afternoon.
afternoon. May I help you?
I hope so. I'm Finnegan. - Nice to meet you.
Tess. - Tess.
don't even think about it.
what? - Don't "what" me. You know what.
it's weird, right?
what? - This.
us, together.
it's complex, but not in a good way.
well, can I just say I really wish we were still married?
no.
Oh, my God, listen to this.
listen. "That we are by no means...
...the first Europeans to visit here...
...is finally proven by the discovery of a Spanish gravestone...
...that of a woman.
I cannot but wonder who she was...
...and how she came to die here, for the headstone reads simply...
...'Aurelia, 1715."'
holy shit.
forsake her I could not.
and so it was here, on this beautiful hilltop...
...that I resolved to bury our own dead...
...and begin work building a church.
he marked it with a headstone.
and this guy built a church around it.
it's in the cemetery. - It's in the cemetery.
Finn. - Mm-hm.
Oh...
no, come on. - Here we go.
Oh, shit, I got you.
Mm-hm.
anything?
it's not here.
I refuse to believe that.
well, just because you refuse to believe something doesn't make it true.
or false.
or whatever the hell I'm saying.
something wrong, Tess?
something wrong? Why would anything be wrong?
we just had sex in a church and we're not even married...
...and now we're gonna dig up a grave.
what is that, like a triple sin?
I can't believe we haven't been struck by lightning. Oh!
Ow. - Oh, shit, you okay?
stupid rock. That's the second time I've done that.
okay, we can't have that.
come here, you rock. Stupid rock.
wait, stop.
Oh... Honey, it's heavy.
so is this.
Finn? Finn?
Finn.
what? - What if it's a body?
well, then he was a midget with very cheap relatives.
what if it's a head? - Do you mind?
Oh, my God.
it's his.
to my everlasting relief...
...and after a year's toil in this lonely place...
...have I finally stumbled upon a suitable place...
...for my cargo...
...fortified by nature against the encroachments...
...accidental or deliberate...
...even of those who would force our tongues to betray its trust.
the low December tide showed us the only way in and the only way out.
but from January to November...
...the beached whale's spout is both ingress or egress.
thus is the vault rendered, made virtually impenetrable.
the beached whale's spout? Are you sure?
Yeah.
it's a blowhole.
it's the one at Clifton Point.
the low December tide drops so low... - The winter solstice.
the lowest tide of the year exposes the mouth of the blowhole...
...which is normally under 15 to 20 feet of water.
two days out of the year it's a cave.
they float the chests in, the tide returns...
...then the place becomes a deathtrap.
did we just find our treasure?
sound like it.
nice to meet you, Mrs. Finnegan.
Hey, Bunny.
what the hell are you doing here?
give me the book. - Come on, Bunny.
I mean, are you sure you don't wanna, you know, give it to the new guy?
what you think you're gonna do with that, huh?
Hey, you better put the damn shovel...
Hey, hey, hey, look, you know, I don't want no trouble.
get me out the hole!
get him, baby, get him.
Finn!
where you...? What you...? Grab him.
come on.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
come on, go, go, go.
Hey. Hey...
get after them, damn it.
hang on.
Cyrus, my bike. Hey, you.
are you shot?
what? - Shot? You?
no. Are you shot? - No, not yet.
we got the book, Cyrus.
Finn!
I got you, Tess!
duck! - What? Ugh!
Finn! - Uh-oh.
Finn. No.
no. Finn. Oh, my...
Finn.
let's go.
you sure he's dead? I've been disappointed a lot of times before.
I should've aimed at your head, you little son of a bitch.
I'm gonna tell you what.
I'm gonna have my boys submit your theory to a little academic review...
...while I go sit my balls on some ice.
after this wave, you've got about 50 seconds.
would you just get in the hole?
Whoa! Whoo!
I can't.
uh...
excuse me, Curtis.
get in the hole.
damn, Cyrus. Why you always in my business, huh?
I'm handling this shit.
you know what? You run it.
you run it.
it's not here.
check underwater.
there's nothing but rock.
I'm supposed to believe you, am I?
you want a second opinion, come on down. Get me out of here.
please.
pull her up, man.
Hey.
say hi to your husband.
what? No.
what the hell are you doing, man?
Oh, God.
throw me the rope.
Whoo!
now that's what I'm talking about.
talk to me.
it's here. Bring the tanks.
we're gonna have to go in through the ocean.
and the girl?
uh...
she won't need one.
this better be good.
Moe, it's Finn. It's bad, it's real bad.
they got Tess. - What?
the treasure's in the blowhole at Clifton Point.
they took her hostage.
that is one big-ass, sensible-sized emerald.
sure, go have fun. Go get yourselves killed.
go pump some lead in your fellow man. Go ahead.
what a sissy.
he is more man than you'll ever be, honey.
Hey. You ladies wanna move out?
they could have killed a whole graduation class by now.
daddy.
I'm scared. - She's going to be all right.
I promise. - I'm worried about you.
Oh, bless you for that.
I'll see you at breakfast.
Hey! Hey!
Goddamn.
how many times am I gonna have to kill this boy?
shit.
Oh, shit.
somebody help.
Tess!
Finn?
Finn!
shit.
Whoo. There's a whole lot more where this came from.
Where's Cyrus? - He said he'd be right up.
Mm.
Ugh.
find out who that was.
huh? - You heard me.
Oh, my God.
shit.
cover me.
where you going?
Where's he going? Wait. Where are you going?
shit, man.
Aah!
you son of a bitch.
Uh-oh.
here, cock it. Cock it.
I can't make it cock.
no, no, no.
give that to me.
you okay, Moe? - Yeah, great.
get in the plane. Get... - No. Aah!
no. - Get your hands off her.
get in the plane.
sit back.
get your hands... Sit back now. Sit back now.
shit.
Gemma. No.
get me on that plane. - Hang on.
go. Go. Go.
you happy now, you big butch bastard?
just go help Moe. Go help him.
I want you to pull me right up next to the port side.
what's a port side?
uh... The left side.
Oh, okay. - Right next to her.
go, go, go, stay with it. - Okay.
my God, what are you doing? - Pull right up next to the pontoon.
Whoa!
now that's a man who loves his wife.
that's it.
that's it.
Oh!
Tess! - Finn!
Tess!
Oh!
damn, baby, since when do you know how to fly?
don't. Can't.
well, you're doing a great job. I mean, we're still in the air, right?
technically.
Oh, shit.
I think he hit the engine.
okay. Um...
wings, flaps, air speed, altitude...
...pedals for the rudder. Check. Okay.
how do you know what to do? - You know...
...PlayStation. Ha-ha!
Oh, God.
Oh, God. - Hang on, hang on.
here we go. Aah!
Whoo! Finn!
Wow. Whoa. - Hey, you're doing it.
way to go. That's great, oh, wow. We're flying.
Yep.
how do we land?
Yep.
how'd you do it in the game?
I'm rich! I'm rich! I'm rich!
now, honey, this next part...
...I'm not exactly sure how to pull off.
I do know that we've got to completely stall out just before we hit the water.
stall? - Stop flying.
stop flying? - Yeah, and land.
on the nice soft... water.
are we gonna die? - No.
no, we're not.
Oh, shit, where's Finn?
probably he's flying the plane.
you mean there's hope?
not necessarily.
Hey, let me just say this. - No.
well, why not? - Because.
tell me after we crash.
that'll give me something to look forward to.
okay.
one hundred.
we got it, baby. Eighty.
sixty.
forty.
pull her up, boy.
baby, baby...
I love you. - I love you.
pull her up.
Oh, shit.
Finn?
Hello, ladies.
so, Leo? What's the excuse for not writing me jokes?
what? You could have made money.
I told both you guys to write jokes for me, and you decided not to.
what, did you have to go to LensCrafters that day?
I was just joking. I like your glasses.
he wanted both of us to write jokes for him, and you didn't tell me?
I apologize. It's not worth, losing your shit over, man.
what, you don't think I like money?
you don't think I like private jets?
you don't think I want a cool job writing for George Simmons?
I just think you're doing well.
you know, you're getting gigs at the Improv all the time.
you're gonna have people writing for you.
you don't need to be writing for other people, you know.
I know, I'm just... I'm sorry, I just...
I wanted something for myself and I just, you know...
it's just, you know, fuck you, Ira!
just because you go into faggy-apology mode doesn't mean I'm gonna forgive you right away!
fuck you, man. Look, I did the exact same thing you've been doing this whole time.
you're being competitive. You do that all the time.
I'm doing it now, okay?
I didn't make it competitive! Yes, you did.
have you ever had to work for money? No.
you didn't work at a coal mine, Ira!
you worked at a deli! Stop crying about it!
I was only supposed to be on that pull-out couch for six months!
and we were supposed to trade! And we never did!
Yeah, we never did switch after six months.
Yeah. Exactly.
you know why? Because I pay rent, Ira!
you don't pay rent. Your parents pay rent!
why don't they move in? It's your fault.
Hey, hey, hey. Pilgrims, Indians, can we please stop fighting?
it's Thanksgiving. We have guests inside. Please stop.
I'm not fighting anymore. I'm done fighting.
thank you. LEO: You called Daisy a starfucker?
why don't you go cup George Simmons' balls while you talk him to sleep every night, Ira?
Leo.
sorry.
I would let you do that, too. My balls are for everybody.
okay. It's starting to feel like Thanksgiving around here.
let's eat some food.
I can't believe you screwed Daisy, man.
what?
so, does anybody want to say grace or anything?
Leo's a good writer, apparently. Come on, get up there.
Yeah, Leo.
man: Leo! Do it, Leo.
I'm okay, I'm okay.
all right, let me go. I'll do it for us.
let me get it done.
okay, so first let's give thanks to our families not being here.
it's always easier without the family.
it's funny, I see you guys and you are just so much younger than me.
and I had no idea I was the old guy until I looked at you guys.
it was like when I was growing up, I had a big nose.
I had no idea until I went to the Gap and saw a three-way mirror, and I was like, Wow, I didn't know I had that thing:
Yeah. No, it's a... It's good to be young.
it kind of sucks being old, so just enjoy this.
enjoy time. Time slips away, I promise you.
I had a dinner like this 20 years ago with guys that we just, like, lost touch with each other.
I never talk to them anymore. Some of them are dead.
so, yeah, you don't... Things slip away.
if you love somebody, don't let them slip away.
I swear to you, this will be your most memorable Thanksgiving, the one that you'll want the rest of your life, the one that you say, "Man, it was never as good as that night."
so, let this night be great. Enjoy the taste of Leo's dinner.
rock n Roll!
Jesus, every time I'm near you I feel like fucking Danny DeVito.
everybody feels like Danny DeVito when, you know, they walk by me.
Yeah. You're a giant.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, yeah.
um...
I don't want to get your hopes up.
Mmm-hmm.
we put you on this experimental medication without much optimism.
about 8% of all the people that we put on this medication get positive results.
Mmm-hmm.
you actually belong to these 8%.
I looked through your blood work, and I couldn't find any traces of the disease.
I don't want to speak too soon, but we may have beaten this thing.
are you fucking with me because I fucked with you?
so, that's the good news, Mr. Bond.
so, this is, this is... This is good news.
like my accent now?
now I like your accent, yeah.
I was excited all morning to tell you this news.
so, what happens now? What do l... What do I do now?
maybe you can make another funny movie that I could laugh about.
Yeah. Wow. I wasn't expecting this to really work.
I was getting used to being sick.
I was actually thinking I was pretty good at that.
get back to your life.
IRA: Hey, this is Ira. I'm not in. Leave a message.
IRA, I have a secret to tell you. It will make you happy.
Hi. Bonita?
George.
I was sick, you know that. And I just went to the doctor's.
he said I'm not sick anymore.
Oh, congratulations.
I found the pants you're looking for. They are in the closet.
thank you.
Bye, George.
George! Is it true?
it's true. Yes!
it's all right. All right, go ahead. Yeah!
all right.
Oh, God! Yeah!
all right, baby.
all right, all right. Now what the fuck do we do?
Hey, congratulations, George. That's awesome, man.
thank you. You got cured of AIDS.
I didn't have AIDS.
Hey, let me get you a cocktail.
Hey, not an AIDS cocktail. A regular.
no, I don't want a drink. I'm good.
I'm gonna get one of them ribbons.
you're alive? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
unbelievable! This guy. This guy, man.
you got the women, you got the fame, and you can't fuck die!
did you suck the devil's dick? What is it, man?
I wanna know the secret.
I actually told a bunch of people we did have sex, so if you could go along with that.
you did? Yes.
everybody wants to fuck me, but it's better that I don't because you don't want...
the mystery is definitely more flattering...
yeah?
... And the reality is so, like, flubbed.
like not the word, but... Flubbed? Yeah, lippety.
Yeah, I look like this. Like a sandwich.
like a... There's, like, meat coming.
that would have been... I could get...
look at that!
yippee-ki-yay, motherfucker!
shit! Shit! I didn't know you had energy like that. Jesus...
how did he... Like, how did he know he had it?
he was saying... He said that he was, like, dizzy and tired and he went to the doctor, and then he just got... It was in his blood work.
that sucks because I get dizzy and tired.
Really?
anybody... Anybody gets sick, I think I'm going to get it.
now, is it contagious? It's not contagious?
no. Can you get it, like...
I hope not. I don't think so. I've been around him a lot. I feel...
I feel... I hope not, too, because when you were talking, a little bit of your spit hit my lip, so...
it did? Yeah. Not that you got it, but he spits on your lip, you spit on mine, next thing you know
I'm dead and my wife's fucking George Lopez.
but I think the best thing for you would be, you know...
the best cure, besides the real cure, is to get back to work and do what you do.
there are stacks of offers on my desk for you.
I mean, you can't swing a dead cat without hitting an offer for you.
Oh, good. Yeah, you ready for this?
paul Rudd wants to do a bromance with you.
I think I might... I just might even not work for a little while.
I was thinking maybe just, like, taking time off, try to get myself in a relationship with, like, another human being, a normal one.
just see if I can handle that.
funny you should say that. I've... Because I invited someone.
brought... Invited this woman here today that I think you'd really like.
I think you'd really hit it off with her.
she's... She's great. She's something new for you.
a real person. She's not a waitress.
she's not an actress.
all right, thanks.
you know, the Internet dating thing actually... Actually kind of works.
that's good.
I've actually been on a couple of JDates.
no way. What's that?
yeah... What's a JDate?
what, is that an Internet thing I should know about?
I'm not... I don't do that shit.
it's a website where Jewish people can find each other.
Really? A whole list of Jewish people? Yeah.
I didn't think Jewish people liked to be on lists.
because of the Holocaust.
Wow.
how's this going, by the way?
it's been great to meet you.
you know what? I think you fucked up.
how's that?
I think you fucked up. I think...
I don't think you should have taken that medicine.
why not?
I don't know. Personally, I think you should have just let yourself die.
honestly, man, what are... What are you gonna do now?
make another bullshit movie?
fuck another chick who doesn't like you?
you know? That was your way out right there.
hmm. Now you're fucking stuck.
Yeah.
you're stuck just like me.
can't go to fucking Chuck E. Cheese.
I can't go to Target, I can't go to Best Buy.
I can't go to fucking Wal-Mart, Kmart.
you fucking name it, I can't go there.
Yeah, that's true.
everyone in this fucking room is either staring at us, wanting to take a fucking picture. Mmm-hmm.
Yeah. Got it.
e-mail that to me.
I will. That's awesome. Yeah.
who the fuck is that guy right there? That fucking guy right there.
what? Ray Romano's bothering you?
who? Ray, Ray who?
ray Romano, the guy from Everybody Loves Raymond.
I don't give a fuck what show he's on.
I'll fuck this motherfucker up, man!
Hey. Hey, Ray!
Hello, Marshall.
fucking problem here, buddy?
would you like to fuck me? Is that what this is?
I don't get it, man. What's going on?
would you like me to fucking bend over for you right now?
say no. No, man.
I just gotta always be on my toes, man.
you know?
I see that, but not with Ray Romano.
this is why I don't go out of the house.
I thought everybody loved you.
so, now that you got this, this second chance, man, like, what do you want?
I kind of don't want anything.
so, then what are we celebrating?
Clarke?
Yes, it's Clarke.
it's Clarke and l... I'm calling to check on you, matey.
Yeah.
I'm back from the sea. It's fun to play with my Didjeridu!
you sound a little bit like a pirate.
do I sound Australian? Is this what Clarke sounds like?
that's a terrible Australian accent.
what are you doing, Laura?
am I bothering you? Is he there? No, no, no, no, no.
am I supposed to hang up? What's going on?
Clarke's away for business in China.
Ah! Sent him out for egg rolls again?
are you guys all right? What's going on?
Mable has her recital tomorrow.
she's singing Memory from Cats.
Oh, yeah?
you know that song, Memory?
Yeah. I wish I could be there to see that.
you can come.
I can come? All right, I'm coming.
your daughter will be all right with that?
that I'm sitting right next to you holding you tight?
stop. How are you feeling?
I'm doing good. I'm doing...
it is what it is. l...
so, what happened with your tests?
Laura, let's not talk about all that.
what did the doctor say?
the Swedish Nazi? He never has good news.
it is what it is. I don't want to talk about it.
come on, let's just talk about you.
what are you doing, Laura?
do you want me to talk you to sleep?
Oh, my God. You remember.
you want me to do that for you?
you will talk to me while I try to go to sleep?
I'll put you on speakerphone. That will be the best night of my life.
let's not go to sleep yet, though, please. Just talk to Laura.
IRA: Hello?
Hi, Ira.
Hey, how's it going?
IRA, you're my best friend.
I like you, too.
you're my best friend.
you sound like you're in a good mood, man.
I'm in a great mood because we're setting sail today.
we're gonna do a gig together!
ira and Georgie, finally on the road!
Oh, we're setting sail, are we? Where, where are we going?
we're going to the Port of San Francisco. We set sail on the morrow.
how much time am I supposed to do?
Oh, they've booked you to do a minute for every inch of cock you have.
you'll be doing two and a half to four minutes, depending on your mood, little Ira.
I was invited to a... Or I was able to go to a fundraiser for Barack Obama, when he was running for president.
and you could walk right up to him and I did.
and I prepared a smart question and I was like, "Senator Obama, when you were a student in Boston, did you encounter any racism?"
and he said something really, really interesting. He said...
he said, "I'm Kanye West."
George, you have a visitor.
George: Oh.
Hi. Whoa!
LAURA: Hello. Wow.
Hey, hi! Hey!
all right. How are you?
LAURA: I'm good.
I'm so psyched you came.
wow, you look amazing! Thank you.
beautiful. I think I overdressed.
no way. You look incredible.
I just...
where... Where is he? Where is the Clarke?
the Clarke? He's out of town. I was gonna bring my friend Betsy with me, but her son started throwing up, so...
the husband's out of town, baby's vomiting. Rock 'n' Roll.
I like it. Yeah. Yeah.
anyway, I don't want to keep you or get in the way.
no, don't run away. Come on, Ira, say hello.
Hey, Ira.
Hey, how's it going?
so, I'll let you go. I just wanted to say hi.
no cursing. Don't curse so much.
okay, all right! Nothing dirty. I don't know how.
you just cut my set in half, but that's fine. All right, see you, kid.
okay, good luck.
thanks for coming.
you gotta tell her I'm better at intermission, all right?
you haven't told her that you're better?
no, I'm not good at stuff like that.
just... She'll be cool with it. She'll be...
you're giving her good news, she'll be happy.
we're gonna go by her house tomorrow, too.
Yeah, we're just visiting her. I just want to say hi, see how she's doing, where she lives, that kind of thing.
why did you guys break up in the first place?
I cheated on her.
why would you cheat on her?
it's easy not to cheat when no one wants to fuck you, you judgmental prick.
okay.
I have a theory that Tom Cruise, David Beckham and Will Smith have mooshed the heads of their penises together.
I think that this has happened.
I don't think it happened in a gay way.
I think it just happened out of boredom.
I think just rich-dude boredom.
just like, "What have we not done, guys? We've done everything!"
I'll tell you one thing we haven't done.
and I bet when it happened, it was an epic occurrence. It was huge.
I think of it all the time.
I think first, you know, David and Tom touched dick heads.
and it was easy, just zoonk. Because there was a magnetic field to it.
and then Will Smith started approaching with his dick and, like, wind started blowing in his face, and paper started flying everywhere and he just couldn't do it.
and they're like, "Come on, Will, get it in there!
I can't do it!
beckham yells, "Don't cross the streams! It's like Ghost Busters!"
and then he does it and Flash by Queen starts playing.
it's just, Flash! Ahhh!
light shoots into the sky! That's how stars are born, I think.
anyway, I'm Ira Wright. Have a good night. Thank you, all, very much.
IRA: Hey. How's it going?
that was so good!
you seem so surprised.
well, you looked so nervous before.
I was, actually.
that was good. That was really good.
thank you. I appreciate that.
and the ball cleavage thing, that was hilarious.
classic stuff. Thank you. Glad you're having fun.
george says that he's known you for a while. How did...
Yeah. How did you guys first hook up?
I was the hat-check girl at the Improv and I was an actress.
so, you kind of... Yeah, yeah.
that's good. What,were you in anything I might've seen?
I did those, like, Melrose Place and 90210.
awesome.
I always played the bitch.
I wasn't that good, actually.
no, you must be a great actress, because you're not at all bitchy, so...
Thanks, Ira.
okay, look, I'm not... Honestly, I'm not supposed to be telling you what I'm about to tell you because George... He doesn't want to jinx it.
it's not 100%, but the last time that he went to the doctor, they couldn't find any trace of the disease in his blood work anymore, so it seems like he might be better.
what are you talking about?
announcer. Ladies and gentlemen...
we think he might be okay.
... George Simmons!
thank you.
thank you. Thank you. Yeah.
it's great to be here.
it's great. It's great to be alive!
Yeah, man. Thank you. Right on. Okay.
man: Thank you for coming, George!
thank you. All right.
that's very nice. Man, oh, man.
any other 40-year-olds out there tonight? In their 40s?
it's funny. In your 20s you're like, "Fuck you, man. Fuck that shit."
fuck my parents. I don't need none of that shit.
in your 30s you're like, "Fuck the President."
fuck that guy, that fucking asshole.
in your 40s you're like, "I'm hungry."
what do we have in the fridge?
so, yeah, I'm fucking famous and rich, and it's crazy.
it's... You know why? Because I hate rich people.
fucking I'm rich and I hate rich people.
I hate everything I fucking do now.
I go to Hawaii, I'm like, "You fucking snotty cocksucker, going to Hawaii."
buy a new car, "La-di-da, look who's got a new car."
you know, I thought about giving all my money, just giving it away, but then I was like, "What a rich-guy thing to do.
Mr. Charitable:
well, why didn't you tell me? I was just here.
Laura, if I told you, you might not have talked to me anymore, so l...
what are you talking about? That's ridiculous.
I knew you forgave me because I was sick and there was no other way you would forgive me.
I know, but it's different now.
we've been talking... What are you... No!
Really?
this is... So, what are you... So, did the...
the doctor said I'm good. I'm better for now.
I don't know what the hell's gonna happen, but for now the guy said I'm good.
I'm so happy.
you are happy?
Mmm-hmm. God, thank you. Thank you.
all right. Yeah.
you okay, man?
Yeah, yeah, I'm good.
I hope they got some food.
Hey, hey.
Hi! Hi.
I'm so glad you guys came. Hello. Hi.
good to see you. Wow. Hi. How's it going?
Hello, Ira.
Oh! Thank you.
jeez. Beautiful house!
thank you.
how long have you guys been here?
we've been here about five years now.
what's up?
this is my friend, George. And this is Ira.
this is Ingrid.
Wow! George didn't mention you had a daughter.
George: Have you seen any of my movies?
I saw the movie where you had a baby body.
so, you saw Re-Do. Can you do the face?
George: Hey, that's a good impression.
don't leave me in the playroom!
this is my daughter, Mable. She just got braces.
Oh, yeah? Let me see them.
you mind if I eat a little bit of that sandwich right there?
IRA? I'm... I'm full.
do you guys want to play the peanut-butter game?
it's fun. You want to play?
let's do it! Ira?
Yeah, I like peanut butter, yeah.
let's do the peanut-butter game!
all right! Hooray!
peanut-butter game! Peanut-butter game!
okay, just put a little bit.
MABLE: Okay. GEORGE: What's she doing?
a little bit.
okay, okay. I think that's good.
this is what you guys do in your free time? Okay.
MABLE: There he is! GEORGE: Oh, boy.
LAURA: Come on.
George: He got her. He got her.
Oh, so, you're supposed to do it on the ears.
LAURA: George's turn! Yeah! George's turn!
no. I don't want to do that.
LAURA: Yeah, George's turn! No, Ira will go. Let Ira go.
no, no, George.
come on. Okay, all right!
I just washed my hair this morning.
both: George! George! George! George!
Oh, God!
No!
just not the...
look at this.
George: That's not the game!
and we have a pond with a Buddha and...
Wow!
does that hurt?
so, what... Who is a good... You're a good guy, you're a bad guy?
now I go.
and now I go.
you can't move. You're stuck.
IRA: Hey.
Hey, Laura asked if we want to eat dinner here tonight.
Oh. Thank you. What... We...
it's like an eight-hour drive back.
we won't get home till like 5: 00 in the morning that way.
George: We'll figure something out.
so, we're gonna go to the grocery store and get some food so I can cook.
home-cooked meal. Perfect.
okay. So, you're okay to watch the girls?
Yeah, definitely. I'm good with kids.
I was a... I was a Jewish summer camp counselor for five years.
but I'm good with non-Jewish kids, too.
okay, so we'll be right back. It's around the corner.
George: Very good.
should I have worn my jogging shoes? Where are we going?
you sure? You sure you want to do this?
Mmm-hmm.
wherever my husband is, he's probably doing the same thing.
Mmm-hmm.
okay.
Jesus.
you know, when I broke up with you,
I tried to find somebody who was the exact opposite of you.
but Clarke is exactly like you.
it's like I'm programmed to find the same person, like there's some lesson I'm supposed to learn from it all.
how many times did you cheat on me?
I don't want to paint a picture.
I was young and stupid, but I changed, I swear to God.
how exactly have you changed?
I got a peek at something most people only get to see once.
you know, I went to a psychic who told me that...
that you and I would get back together when we were 70.
and she also said not to eat any chicken.
well, we couldn't wait.
Mmm-hmm.
you loved me before anybody loved me.
I know.
this is the only place that I ever wanted to be.
when is George gonna die?
george is gonna die?
no. Why would you guys say that?
I heard my mom talking to her friend on the phone, and she was crying.
I don't want George to die.
why do you care? You just met him.
shut up.
you shut up! Okay, okay, guys, guys, guys.
george is not gonna die.
George, he was sick, but he went to the doctor and they gave him different types of medicine until they found one that worked.
and now he's gonna be just fine.
he's gonna live a really, really long time.
I think my mommy loves him.
well, you know, we all love him.
he's made a lot of great movies.
I think she loves him, like, loves him.
INGRID: Love. Love, love, love.
love, love, love. They're gonna have a baby.
they're gonna have a baby baby, marriage, love.
they're gonna have a little MerMan baby.
you saved my acting reel? I was wondering where this was.
why didn't you give this to me?
because I was watching it.
you know, I always get the feeling that you think I'm stupid or something.
LAURA: Look at my hair! I look like a leprechaun.
no.
Laura ：.I am stupid.
Ooh! Is my voice still that high?
No! No, no, no, no. No, but they need you back in Munchkinville.
they miss the mayor.
LAURA: Shut up!
that was the best time in my life.
I got something else for you. You might remember these.
please tell me you do!
are these my favorite butt jeans?
Yes. Yes. Yes.
Really?
Yeah, you can have them back.
I'm so excited! Yeah.
do you think they still fit me?
I guarantee it.
I'm so happy!
I guarantee it. Get in those.
these used to kill me. Oh, my God, they're so faded.
Oh, shit!
they fit!
they look good! Really?
Yeah, that's the same ass!
fucking ass is perfect. Minus that camel coming out the back.
bump and groove it
to the left now to the right, all
slap that shit!
look at that! They're like Mom jeans.
Oh, yes. If Mom needed to get banged again.
thank you.
Yeah, get over here.
don't leave me. Don't leave me.
Oh! Hey, guys, what took you so long?
we were checking out the town, man. Beautiful!
where are the groceries?
we decided that eating in might be more fun.
Oh, no, you didn't.
how could you do that, man? No.
I didn't do anything, Ira.
no, I know you did it. I know you did.
all that's missing is your Popsicle. Come on.
IRA, are you cranky right now?
do you need food in your belly?
no.
come on, we're gonna order in a pizza.
of course, Mr. Peters.
I'll be at the...
lunch meeting.
you're serving seafood?
I love seafood!
okay, see you there!
pizza's here! Yeah.
I'll be right back. Yes.
I'm the pizza monster!
Hi, honey!
Clarke. Hi, sweetie.
Hi. What are you doing here?
decided to surprise you.
the guy I was meant to have the meeting with had a heart attack while I was waiting in reception for him.
it was unbelievable. Wow.
next minute, this Chinese George Clooney guy comes running past with, like, the...
what's it called? A defibrillator?
starts zapping him. Right. Yeah, I've seen it.
it was like an episode of ER, but with Chinamen.
I missed you.
I know you.
Yes.
Yes.
how you doing?
this is George Simmons.
he had a big comedy concert last night.
Oh, okay.
and so, I asked him to pop by and come visit.
hope that's good. l...
I love the stand-up comedy.
Yeah, yeah. How'd it go?
they didn't... They didn't boo me off the stage, so that was a plus.
Yeah, they're a bunch of bloody cheese eaters up here.
Yeah. No, they were very nice. Yeah.
you have a... You have a very nice family, man, and a great, great home.
thank you.
well, it's good to have you home.
the kids are dying to see you if...
ira's hungry for...
G'day. Clarke.
good day, I'm Ira.
your husband's here. LAURA: Yeah. Yep.
ira is George's opening act. He's really funny.
Really? He looks funny!
thank you.
how'd you go last night?
you know, they didn't boo me off or anything, so...
I just said that one.
it was great. Yeah.
they just popped by, I gave them a tour of the house.
we were gonna have dinner, but it's not...
it's probably better that we do family dinner since you're only in town a few days.
no, stay. That's a great idea.
the more the merrier.
okay. Let's do that.
thank you. LAURA: Great.
I'm gonna go say hi to the kids.
okay. Okay.
that's hilarious.
you can't tell him that you're better, okay?
he'll know that something happened between us.
I won't. Okay?
because I've been married for 12 years now and I have kids.
and I can't just throw it away this second, okay?
Hey, we'll be fine. I'm a good actor. You're a great actress.
right. He hated you until he found out that you were sick.
and if he knows that you were here and that you're feeling better, he's gonna know.
so, don't say anything.
okay, yeah, yeah.
of course. Sure. I'll do that.
people never thought China would do that much business with the US, but I never saw it as a big deal. You look at it like this.
you've got a billion people.
we make all kinds of cool shit.
they find out about the cool shit, like, on the Internet and stuff.
and they're gonna want the cool shit.
cool shit's universal.
china's been good, but I'm trying to get into North Korea now.
that's the next... That's, like, the next frontier.
Wow. Wow. North Korea? North Korea.
those people would blow you for a Wii Fit.
George: There you go.
this is really good pizza.
you know, they say, like, New York has the best pizza and I always thought pizza in LA was only okay, but who would have thought, you know,
marin County is where they were really hiding the good pizza pies.
clarke speaks fluent Chinese.
Really? Do you speak Cantonese or Mandarin?
Oh, well played, Ira. Mandarin.
well gayed, Ira.
it's a bloody hard language, though, George. Jesus.
that was like a scene from Deer Hunter.
girls, you can go and watch TV.
go on. Whatever you want to watch.
so, George, how's the fight going, mate?
how is it?
Clarke. This is not something that he wants to talk about right now.
he has to think about it every day of his life.
and he's taking a break from it right now.
it's such a shame that somebody who has brought so much joy to so many people has to go through this.
shit. Shit.
I'm sorry, mate.
Laura. Laura. We don't need to speak in code.
I'm sick. I think about it all the time.
CLARKE: Mate, I don't know how you do it.
I would be crying in my panties if I was you.
I worship guys like you, that attitude.
have you considered Eastern medicine?
well, I don't know if this is considered Eastern medicine, but I've been eating a lot of rhino cock.
if Clarke thinks it's the right thing to do, let me chew some.
for the last time, stop calling me Rhino.
george Simmons in my house!
clarke took an herb once, and he had heart palpitations and diarrhea.
no, it's true. I shit myself, mate, and I had a boner at the same time.
I want to take an herb that makes me as good-Iooking as you.
Jesus Christ!
if I were you I'd be at home all day fucking myself.
CLARKE: That's what I do!
all right! All right! We're cooking.
he's really funny. Mmm-hmm.
I don't know why his movies aren't funny, though.
that's weird, isn't it? Mmm-hmm.
he should put some of that on the silver screen.
so, just one drinks, okay?
this isn't someone I want to spend a lot of time with.
this? This is the Australian me?
I'm so much better than this fucking idiot.
he seems like the nicest guy, ever.
he's trying to cure you with herbs for God's sakes.
I can't leave her alone here. I have to save her.
save her from her beautiful house and lovely husband and delightful kids?
her husband's a skipping, cheating psycho.
you said nothing was going on between you two.
the dog could tell that you banged her.
and I'm getting nauseous and sweaty. I can't...
get away from me! Get away from me! Go play with the kids.
woman: Tim, are you asking me out on a date?
would you like it to be a date?
Hey, bro, so your doctor called and he said it is contagious, but only when inflamed, so you're cool.
also, I was trying to do the laundry, but I think I need to get some industrial-strength detergent.
what's up with all the skid marks, Dale Earnhardt, Jr?
wow, I think I have a class.
you guys like this show?
both: No!
it's the worst show, ever.
good.
here you go. We're finished with the French shit.
we're into espa? OK!
all right.
china, man. Wow.
and you guys never see each other, huh? That must be rough.
right? Rough on the kids.
it's not ideal, but the kids like to eat, so...
you ever see this girl act before? She was quite the actress.
well, she's very good at pretending she still loves me, so she's pretty good then, isn't she?
Yeah. I am.
can't say I watched much of that Melrose Place stuff, though.
although I did see the Party of Five episode you were in.
it wasn't really for me, you know.
well, it was down to me and Cameron Diaz for the lead part in The Mask.
cameron Diaz! That's my girl.
she's a bloody top actress, isn't she?
Hey, what was that film she was in with the bloody spuff in her hair?
something About Mary!
I love that movie! She's so funny!
just about shit my panties in that one.
no, no, no, there's not too many girls that are this beautiful and sexy and funny and...
she had the whole deal.
Yes, but Cameron Diaz, fuck! I mean, come on.
see, if you had've done that movie, you could have had the bloody stuff in your hair.
look out.
CLARKE: What are you giving me the evil eyes for?
you're such a dick sometimes.
I'm not... Why?
because.
CLARKE: I'm just saying you had your crack, you had your go at it.
I feel like I didn't reach my potential that...
Oh, please!
Oh, please, what?
I didn't reach my potential, either!
I could have been playing footie!
you weren't that good at playing footie. I was.
LAURA: You weren't.
you should thank me, George. I took a bullet here for you.
all right, on that note, I'm gonna head back to Los Angeles.
no, come on, stay.
no, it's fine. I'll split.
it's early. I've been here too long.
Schmira! We just started a bottle.
Nah, nah, nah. You guys have been the best. Schmira!
thank you so much for having us, guys. Oh!
shoot. CLARKE: Uh-oh! Look out.
God, I'm sorry, guys.
CLARKE: Someone's had too much to drink.
Oh, man, no. No, I just kicked your pot by accident, that's all. l...
hold it together there, Schmira. I'm just a... Oh, God.
it's okay.
you're staying here. You're not driving.
no way. We got a guest house, two spare beds. Done.
you two, plenty of room to stay. No, no. Ira can drive.
he... You're fine to drive, right, Ira?
I am. I just kicked your begonias, that's all.
no way! I'm not having America's favorite funnyman dead on the side of the road because Schmira here's had too much to drink.
George, you can drive, right?
bullshit! You're staying here.
Plus, there's a game of Aussie-rules footie on the dish tonight.
semi-final. Saints versus Maggies.
not that American shit. I want you to see it.
one condition. You Aussie pussies got any beer around here?
Yes, it's on...
Yes!
Yeah, it doesn't matter if you're a small fucker or a big fucker, you can play this game because the small fuckers go in barreling and they can get the ball over and the boys are scrambling.
now watch. The little fuckers down there go.
there they are. Big fuckers smack them.
little fucker. Little fucker. Off to a big fucker.
now he's gonna go down to another big fucker. I hate that big fucker.
where are the black guys?
CLARKE: This is... There's a couple out there.
I hate this team. Oh, yeah?
magpies. Hate the Maggies!
they're like... I don't know what the equivalent in the NFL...
no helmets. No fucking helmets because they're real men. See?
love you. Just explaining the game to them. They're loving it!
Yeah, we gotta get going, you know.
are you sure you can't stay?
we can't stay. We can't stay.
Yeah, it's my... It's my grandmother's 85th birthday.
we got family coming in from all over.
George: That's right.
she just had a stroke. In her leg.
so, you know, we gotta get back.
Yeah.
that's too bad you guys can't stay.
it is too bad.
well, I wish I could say I was gonna see you again, George, but I can't really say that, can I?
Yeah, yeah, I guess you can't.
you don't have to do that, honey.
no, I do have to do this, honey. I do.
you know what, mate?
there's one thing I've learned from my Buddhist friends, the Chinese, is to keep an open heart and to speak the truth.
so, what I want to say to you, George, is thank you.
thank you for playing such a big role in my wife's life.
it's been great getting to know you.
and I wish you a peaceful journey from here on in and over to the other side.
come here, mate.
okay, we're gonna do this.
thank you. Thank you for everything.
all right.
thank you.
all right, I appreciate your having us.
don't worry, Daddy. He's not sick anymore.
ira told us.
I didn't say that.
Yes, you did. Yeah, you did.
when we were coloring. IRA: No.
Yeah. Yeah.
IRA: That's not true, girls.
no, that's not true. IRA: I did not say that.
I don't know what they're talking about.
liar.
liar, liar, pants on fire.
they were freaking out. They were worried about George.
I just said it so they wouldn't be scared. It was just...
kids, go inside.
can we watch Borat? Yeah, you can.
INGRID: I don't wanna watch Borat. Yes, you... Come on.
see you guys.
what is going on around here? Is that true?
I never said that he was feeling better.
he just took some medicine and it's looking good for him because they can't detect it in his blood, but that doesn't mean that he's better.
these things are very tricky and he didn't want to tell anybody because he didn't want to jinx it!
is that true that you didn't want to jinx it?
Yeah. No, no, no, l... Yeah, I'm very superstitious.
Mmm-hmm.
you're a terrible liar.
no, nothing's going on around here!
it's completely innocent.
... On the side table. Jamaican?
don't mock me. I don't appreciate it.
lots of people go to massage parlors.
that doesn't mean I was getting a rub-and-tug.
those hairs on me jacket must've fallen off the waiter's pussy.
what the hell has gotten into you?
I was at a footie game!
are you taking the piss out of me?
I would never lie to you, mate?
I'm not playing this game with you.
this is stupid. What a stupid game!
clarke, let's tell each other the truth.
just come clean with me.
there's nothing to tell.
there's nothing to tell?
there's nothing to tell.
you will never tell me the truth. That is a pussy move!
you know what? I'm not doing this.
I'm not being put on a cross for something I didn't even do!
enjoy each other!
go fuck your whores!
go fuck your whores"?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I don't need to be in a marriage that is like that, so I'm fine.
I'm not worried about that. I just want you to be okay.
I would be scared if I was you right now.
are you kidding me?
this is what needed to happen.
I would run away.
no, I'm staying here.
are you gonna run away?
where am I running to? Only if you come with me.
I really need you around right now.
Yeah. Yeah.
can you stay till Monday?
Absolutely.
can't we just go and, like, come back later, you know?
I mean, if this is meant to be, it'll be.
we don't have to be here right this second.
can't we just go?
man, I don't... I see...
Jesus Christ, every instinct in my body is telling me to leave here, too.
good.
but that's what led me to this shitty life.
I gotta stay here. I gotta do the right thing. I love her.
right now, her husband is gonna come back and murder us, man!
did you see his arms? They look like legs!
shut up. Don't be an idiot.
I'm not being an... Imagine that you are a gigantic Australian man and someone came into your home and fucked your wife.
you would murder him and then you would make a hat out of his skin because that's what Australians do. Let's go!
IRA, this is deep shit. People get divorced.
they make mistakes, they change their lives.
it's not that big of a deal. She's married to an asshole.
she seems like a crazy actress, man.
I don't know what to tell you, man.
am I not allowed to be happy or something?
I've been living alone and alone and alone. That's my life.
this is the only girl I've ever loved and I'm not supposed to do anything about this?
when am I supposed to be happy?
why does everyone else get to be happy?
look, George, I'm just gonna tell you this, as a friend.
from where I'm sitting it seems like your happiness might be coming at the cost of destroying this family.
okay, let me respond to that, as your friend, and let you know you're not my friend.
you fucking work for me!
I didn't ask for your advice! You're overstepping your boundaries, man!
now go get me a fucking Diet Coke!
and remind yourself that's what you do for me!
now get the fuck out of here!
fine.
don't fucking leave! Sit down here! I don't want to be alone.
okay, fine.
this is Mark.
Hey, Mark, it's Ira. How's it going, man?
not too good. I didn't get the part in the Tobey Maguire movie.
that doesn't matter. I have a problem. I need help, okay?
where have you been?
I'm in Marin County. Northern California.
listen, l... I have to tell you something.
are you sitting down?
Yeah. Okay.
the other night I went out to drinks with the producers of my show and Leo met up with us.
and they were enamored by him and they thought he was really funny.
and they offered him a part on Yo Teach...! And he took it.
I saw the episode. I know that that happened.
you watched it? I watched it.
did you love it?
Yeah. He was great, right?
it was fine! I have no problem with Leo, okay?
tell Leo, if he's got a problem, to stop being a baby and to just get over it!
why don't you tell Leo yourself?
because Leo's been surveilling this whole conversation.
you dick. LEO: Fucking asshole.
mark: Leo, get off the phone! Screw you, Leo. Screw you.
Hey, man what have you been up to?
sucking George Simmons' balls?
that's cool. I've been on Yo Teach...! Living it up.
I'm sorry, Leo. Yo Teach...! sucks.
leo: Go lose some more weight, Ira!
you look fucking weird skinny!
mark: Leo, calm down!
you know what, Ira? I want to put my eyeglasses on your asshole so it looks like you're blowing me when I'm fucking you in the ass, you jerk!
IRA: That doesn't even make sense!
you're gonna put glasses on my ass? What?
IRA, we will find something for you to do on the show, okay?
teach can have more than one friend.
can we talk about this later?
I am in a serious problem. I just need some advice, okay? Please?
just listen to me for two minutes and tell me what I should do right now, okay?
will you do that?
all right. If it's serious, I'm sorry. I will listen.
okay. Here's what's happening.
I'm witnessing a slow-moving train wreck, but if I do something, I will lose my job.
are you serious?
so, what I don't know, is...
screw you.
higher! Higher!
higher! Higher!
I can't. l... I can't. Yes, you can.
you, you have to go down a little bit then through the middle. LAURA: Be careful. Don't let him fall on you.
where do I put my hand?
I spoke to Clarke. He's gonna be at the airport tonight heading back to China.
I'm gonna go tell him that when he comes back he should find another place to live.
wait, wait, wait, wait. What...
you... Yeah? Good. Good. Yeah.
you're gonna tell him?
I just don't want him coming back here.
you don't need him. No.
that'll just get you sick.
good, you gotta tell him. So, when are you doing that?
tonight? Yeah.
okay, okay, I'm coming down.
jump!
I talked to a girlfriend of mine, and she has somebody who could show us some houses down in Los Angeles.
and we'll get that whole thing going.
and then I was thinking about taking the kids out of school now, but we should probably let them finish up because it's December.
and I don't want to mess everything up.
they have to finish the whole year here.
Yeah, that makes sense to me. So, if we just go down at the beginning of the summer, let them kind of transit. I'm supposed to do a little two-week tour this summer.
I'm supposed to do it, but I don't need to do it.
no pressure on you. Look at you! There's no pressure on you.
I need to work and I want to get my acting career going again.
good. Yeah.
she's whupping you, Ingrid! Good job there, Lulu.
so, she's gonna go to the airport tonight and tell Clarke that she wants him to find a new place and...
what do you think of that?
I don't want to tell you what I think about that because I don't want to get yelled at, George.
Oh, God.
I'm just nervous about the kids and, like, who's gonna get them and does he get one and Laura gets one, or am I gonna have both of them?
because I love the little one, we kind of click.
but the older one is, like, you sense the period's coming soon.
I think she would probably get the kids.
all right, yeah.
I don't think you can have two girls in China.
what are you gonna do now? Look at this crew.
why so close? Really?
whoa, whoa, whoa!
you okay, little girl? You okay?
Oh, man. Are you okay?
okay. I'm gonna show you Mable singing...
mom, you make everybody see...
no, Memory from Cats. Come on! It's...
no. I hate that you show it to everyone.
I'll just show them the end part.
I'll just show you the ending. Okay.
burnt-out ends of smoky days
the stale cold smell of morning
the streetlamp dies, another night is over
another day is dawning
touch me
it's so easy to leave me All alone with the memory
of my days in the sun
if you touch me You'll understand what happiness is
look, a new day has begun
that was unbelievable!
isn't that good?
that was insane!
that was like just seeing a little person sings an old person's song.
that was hysterical!
I got a friend who takes... He takes a lot of acid.
if he saw that, he would shit himself!
that's not supposed to be funny.
I know, I know, I know. I'm...
no, I think that's why it's funnier.
it was so amazing.
wasn't that good?
I think I started crying a little bit.
me, too. I cry every time I see that.
that shit was funny up there.
okay. Wow, these guys are not gonna take no for an answer.
Yeah. They want me to do another baby movie.
they keep bumping up the gross on the DVDs.
I just... There's no way I'm doing it.
okay. Bye.
Hey, George.
Yeah.
I'm going to... I'm gonna go to the store and grab some cigarettes, okay?
I'll be back soon.
what? What do you need cigarettes for?
cause I'm addicted to them.
Why? Because you look like the Fonz when you smoke?
I've always smoked. I just didn't do it in front of you 'cause you were sick.
and now that you're better...
hurry up, though, man. I'm running out of gas with the kids here.
okay. I'll hurry up.
memory, all alone in the moonlight
I can't wait till the morning
are my parents getting a divorce?
why... Why... Why do you ask that?
just, like, I can tell. They're always fighting and...
how does that make you feel?
well, he's already away a lot, so it doesn't really matter that much, but...
Uh-huh.
that wouldn't be fun.
maybe it would be better if they were separated.
Mmm-mmm.
no?
that's not good.
right.
Clarke?
Laura, what are you doing here?
I don't know.
woman ON PA: Mr. Way Chen, you need to get to the information desk. Thank you.
you've reached Ira.
please leave me a message. Thank you.
where are you? You gotta come back here.
I think I'm getting... I'm getting Ionely here.
I need some help. Just, seriously, hurry up.
I don't trust you. Am I imagining things?
you're not imagining anything, honey.
two times. That's all I did was two times.
and I don't want to ruin everything just because of two fucking times.
she couldn't even speak English.
look at our life. You're driving the kids to school.
you're picking them up. You're like a single mother.
and you're not a single mom. You're my wife. You're my baby.
I shouldn't be in China trying to sell Oreos to people who don't want to fucking talk to me.
I'm gonna get a normal job. I'm gonna be just around the corner.
it's just gonna be you, me and the kids.
all I want is a fresh start.
Yeah.
Oh.
Yeah.
the George Simmons thing was just a flirtation.
it was nothing. He really was sick. He just got better.
I'm so fucking glad. Yeah.
I really like him. I do. I don't want to hate him.
I fucking love you.
Ira!
Hey!
what are you doing here?
I'm going back to Los Angeles.
la?
Yeah.
you're in the Great China Air First Class Lounge, mate.
what are you doing?
Oh. Shit, this is a confusing airport.
I thought this was Panda Express.
well, it's good to see you guys, though.
what's going on? Laura?
what the hell is going on?
uh... Ask her.
I was so mad at you for the way that you've been treating me that I was on my way here to tell you tonight to find another place to live when you got back.
but then... I came here to stop her.
CLARKE: Shut the fuck up.
I slept with George once, but it's over.
it's done. And it was no big deal.
we didn't even have sex. He just went down on me.
that's worse.
CLARKE: Crikey.
he manipulated me with his disease!
where is he? George, where is he?
he's at your house.
he's at our house? With our kids?
LAURA: Please don't get that look on your face.
please don't get that look on your face.
it was a mistake. I'm gonna kill him.
no, no, no, no, no.
I'm sorry.
you're sorry?
I came here to stop... Who are you?
I don't know. Who are you?
what are you doing here?
I was trying to help you.
get the fuck out of my life!
okay.
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.
where is it? Where is it? Oh, God, where is it?
so stupid! Stupid shit!
I wanted to tell you I miss you. I miss your kisses.
I miss your short skirts. And I miss your smell.
get the Baby.
we're gonna go find that wizard.
Hey, girls. You look so cute.
you, outside.
is he in trouble?
Yes.
what's gonna happen? I don't know.
what do you think I did?
Oh, shit!
your friend sold you out, mate!
LAURA: No, no, no, Clarke!
CLARKE: You think this is a game? Stop it!
What'd you think you were gonna do?
come in and just fuck up my family?
IRA: Stop it! CLARKE: Is that what you thought?
stop it. Stop. No, no, no, no!
George: I didn't fucking do anything! This sort of shit I kill for!
don't kill him! Don't kill him!
you stupid shit!
No!
fuck, man!
come here! Run, George!
don't hurt him, you maniac!

IRA: Run, George! You're cornering yourself! Go that way!
get away from me! Take it like a man, George!
get away from me, you fucking crazy asshole!
you fucking asshole! Get away!
Oh, my God.
she's not happy with you!
no one who's married is happy, you idiot!
get in a ball, George! Get in a ball!
fight like a man! Get on your feet, would you?
I don't know how to fight! I'm a comedian, you fucking asshole!
should I jump in?
No! No! Don't jump in!
just get away from me, man! You traitor!
go get more cigarettes, you liar!
IRA: I accomplished nothing!
they made up before I got there!
Where's your helmet now, Yankee?
let's talk! Clarke!
LAURA: Clarke, no!
come on, pussy!
help!
all right!
stop!
IRA: I got him! I got him! You don't want this, Schmira.
you don't want a piece of me, Schmira!
I am gonna love this!
God!
you son of a bitch! I knew you didn't want me to be happy!
what are you doing, man? Look at this! You fucking suck!
you've gone crazy! You're a lightweight...
get away from me, man!
... Named Ira Wiener! Ira Wiener!
you should have died! Well, I ain't going nowhere!
I'm never gonna die! I hope you die!
I'm never gonna die, baby! Die!
boys, stop it! IRA: I hope you die! I hate you!
I know what you're trying to do, the pair of you!
you're trying to distract me so I won't hit him!
lackey! Lackey!
IRA: Wait!
Oh, shit, Clarke! Dude!
are you okay, George?
Where's your stunt man now, hey?
stop it!
will you stop hitting me?
I'm better now, but it can come back!
Laura, tell him. Tell him what you told me.
tell him that you love me more than you love him. Tell him!
Yeah, when she told you that, did she think you were dying, huh?
tell him. Tell him. Is it me or him?
him.
what? Come on! Are you serious?
he's my husband. We have a family.
I love him.
and you didn't even cry when Mable sang Cats.
what's the matter with you?
I didn't want to lie. I don't know.
I've seen it on Broadway before.
it wasn't as good as it.
what are you guys doing on the lawn?
I'm hungry!
nothing. We're just... We're just mucking around.
come on. Go back inside.
sorry, George. I'll always love you.
but what are we gonna do?
I love you.
I'm sorry I came up here. I shouldn't have come.
no, I'm glad you did.
maybe when we're 70?
I hope you find a way to be happy.
shit. He's coming back. He's coming back. Let's go.
LAURA: Clarke.
you know what? I've just worked out why all this shit has happened.
in the East, they call this karma.
and I have brought all this shit upon us with my misbehavior.
that's why all this shit has happened.
this had to happen.
but some good shit's gonna come from this.
we have to learn from this, you know, all of us.
there's a good lesson here.
underneath anger is hurt, but underneath hurt is love.
you feel it?
okay?
Yeah. Thank you.
I'm sorry about this.
Yeah, yeah. Don't worry about it.
do you want me to drive?
no, you don't have to drive me. I'll drive myself.
in fact, you're never gonna have to drive me again because you're fired, Ira.
you're the only person that I've ever heard of that learned nothing from a near-death experience, George.
you went backwards. You're worse.
you know what I am? A good friend.
I would never run to the airport and rat somebody out.
I don't have that in my DNA. That's not a friend, man.
a friend tells you. A friend comes up to you and says, "Hey, you're in a heap of shit. You better not do it.
he doesn't run and tell the fucking girl.
well... Wow.
good. Fire me. I don't want to be around you anymore, 'cause you are fucking contagious!
you think I can't get another assistant?
I can't get someone else to write jokes for me?
you think I'm gonna lay in my bed going, "Aw, I miss my Schmira"?
you're a fucking no-thought. That's the beauty.
once you're gone it never comes back in my brain.
you think getting Laura would have made you happy?
I know so. You think if you had a family right now, you would be happy?
you'll never be happy, because you're always gonna be stuck with yourself!
unless somehow you can get away from you, you're always gonna be miserable, George.
you are not funny.
well, if that means I'm less like you, then good, I don't want to be funny, okay?
mission accomplished, Ira.
bad career choice.
comedy usually is for funny people.
gotcha.
chances are you've got a lot of stuff stuffed in your drawers and closets that you don't really need.
Mary Bolster is editor-in-chief of Natural Health magazine.
she's here to help you get trashing, bagging and get organized.
Hello, Mary. MARY: Hi, Hoda.
HODA: Okay, we do save things for the wackiest reasons.
good morning. Hi.
I think I'm gonna forgive him today.
what? Really? Yeah.
great! That's great news!
he's just gonna be so jealous that I'm on Yo Teach...! You know?
I just figured it'd be a cool thing to do.
well, maybe we could find something for him.
you know, if it comes up organically, definitely, but we shouldn't force it.
you know? Right.
I don't want to be on Yo Teach...!
it's okay. I forgave you, you know?
thank you.
so, how'd everything go up there this weekend?
I think I did the right thing, but George fired me and punched me in the face.
you want to talk about it?
no.
I kind of wish you would. It sounds like the greatest story, ever.
wake me up at 2: 00. I'll tell you about it.
well, we're glad you're back.
glad you're home.
I can't believe I have to start all over again.
Hey, man, how you doing?
Hey, how you doing? Heard you were sick.
you feeling better now? Over here!
man: George, second lease on life. What are you gonna do now?
Hey, guys, come on. Come on, I heard rumors about another baby movie. What do you got, huh?
Yeah, yeah, we're gonna shoot that. That should be good.
gonna start that in a little bit. Let me get by you, though.
it's nice up here, huh?
Yeah. How'd you find it?
me and my friends, we hike up here and I always thought, "You know, that'd be a great place to take "a woman if you... If you knew one"
well, now you know one.
good.
Hey, I'm gonna give him the light.
Thanks, Mark.
Bailey, you're number two.
Hey, Ira. How you doing?
good. How you doing?
Randy: Wassup, big money?
you guys know each other?
Yes. I've seen this young Jewish comedian.
Randy, what's happening?
I saw this cat down at Otto's yesterday. Made me a little panini.
grilled chicken pesto. Shit was nice.
Yeah, I'm working at Otto's again.
George: So, you're going up?
Yeah, I'm about to go up now. See you guys.
later!
thank you. Thank you.
my friends are very sexually aggressive, which is hard for me.
you know, we'll watch television and they'll just see...
a hot girl will come on and they'll just be, "Man, I wanna fuck the shit out of that girl, man!
I'm gonna fuck that girl!
and I, like, can't even say that.
I can't even pretend I would do that.
I see a hot girl on TV and I'm like, Man, I would friend the shit out of her!
I would be her girlfriend!
I would drive her to the airport, man!
I would hold her purse while she shopped, all over her tits!
thank you.
Hi, I need a pound of turkey and a half-pint of macaroni salad, please.
um... Yeah, I'll just be one sec, okay?
okay, thanks.
the last time I came here, the roast beef you gave me had the string still around it and I was unaware of this and fed it to my husband, and he choked.
how's it going, George?
you get a break or anything where you can talk?
okay, yeah. Sure. Chuck, I'll be one sec, okay, man?
shit.
so, you had to get your job back here, huh?
Yeah. You know, I figured I could use a little job stability.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I get health insurance. It's pretty good.
so, I thought a lot about what you said in the car to me.
a few of those things might have been accurate.
you tried to help me and I'm sorry I put you in the middle of all that stuff.
I'm better in my body.
my brain has a ways to go, though.
how are you doing, though? You're doing okay?
I don't know, Ira.
I caught your whole set the other night, Ira. Nice.
Yeah, yeah, no, you're getting a rhythm.
you're starting to be the Ira I like in real life on stage.
Thanks. Yeah, I've been getting up a lot lately, so it's going well.
Yeah, you were funny, and it was a fart-free set.
I wrote some stuff down that night that... Some jokes.
you want to hear it?
you what?
I couldn't stop thinking of jokes for you last night. It was bizarre.
I'm not saying they're good jokes, but I try.
you actually wrote them down!
Yeah, yeah, yeah. My fucking memory's horrible.
that thing you did about the Wii Fit thing. What's that?
Oh, like, "My video game..." Yeah.
my video game told me I'm fat?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. "The ultimate betrayal:" Yeah.
right, right. You could maybe say, "I mean, that's like my pot telling me I'm lazy.
Oh, that's really funny.
and the Wii is similar to my grandmother.
she used to tell me I'm getting chubby and then bring me chicken parmesan and say, 'Why are you so fat?"'
that's really funny!
it's true. The video game made me fat and... It is like my grandmother.
all right. "Why are you so fat?"
here's four gallons of chocolate milk.
that's good! She would always do that.
that's good. I got one I've been afraid to tell, kind of, about, like, Viagra. It's like, "My grandfather takes Viagra "and he thought he was tittie-fucking my grandmother...
yeah? But then he realized he was tittie-fucking his own balls.
that's funny! You got to do that!
that's pretty funny, huh?
you got to say that the thing... That when you're that old and you have a boner that there's not a good position, you know?
that's funny! That's really...
you do it doggy-style, your knees hurt.
you get water on your knee.
I can't even hold myself up in..." Exactly.
what would an old man do?" Yeah...
warren ZEVON: Let's do another bad one then because I like it when the blood drains from David's face.

Carl: Ease it back.
basket is in the water! - We're out of time. We gotta go, Carl.
hold position. Steady. Hold.
he's putting the survivor in the basket.
your rad alt's going crazy.
Yeah, yeah, I know. I'm all over the place.
come on, Carl, we gotta go now!
I don't have a ready-for-pickup signal yet.
Whoa! Carl! Behind you!
holy shit!
we lost our tail rotor!
pilot 1: Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!
coast Guard 6096 is going down!
Mayday! Mayday! 6096 is going in.
Carl. I'm here.
Carl.
hold on, Carl. Hold on.
they'll be coming for us.
I got you. You're okay now.
you're okay. I'm here, Carl.
we're okay. Hang on. I got you.
Carl: You think they're coming? - Oh, yeah, they're coming.
I want a C-130 over that crash site now.
lieutenant Krauss, start the mishap checklist.
aye, Captain.
captain, I've got an EPIRB hit on Randall's survivor suit.
launch ready helos. Swimmer provide.
we have a C-130 coming off a case off Attu. It's already low on fuel.
I don't care. Have them cut an engine.
I want him to know he's not alone out there.
listen. Listen.
you hear that?
hold on, Carl. Here we go, Carl. I got you.
what's the ETA on the backup helo?
Helo's en route to Cold Bay.
they should be on-scene, three, maybe four hours.
make it three.
Jesus. How much more of that stuff do you think I got in me?
feel that?
you feel that? - Yeah.
that means you're alive. I'm not gonna let go.
don't you! - I'm not gonna. I'm not gonna.
doctor: Serious fractures, like in the C-spine, which could cause paralysis.
mostly what we see is old fractures in the arms, also in the leg, but nothing acute. Nothing new with this injury, luckily.
we just hope the kidneys kick in and start to help him resolve a lot of that fluid.
thank you very much.
we've been friends a long time, haven't we?
I've always been good to you, haven't I?
DiDrt promote you to a desk when you turned 40 like everybody else.
that's right.
all right, so now I need you to listen to me.
okay.
there's an instructor opening at "A" School, that...
no. The answer is no.
you just said you'd listen. Sit down.
I'm not interested, Captain.
well, it's no longer a request, Senior Chief. Sit down.
you're serious?
you have two choices.
sign the papers today and you can live life as a civilian here in Kodiak, if that's what you want.
or you can take that "A" School opening I'm offering you.
I've already spoken to command down there.
it will be your class. You will be in charge.
you can take the time to work your way back into shape.
I am in shape.
God damn it, that's not what I'm talking about.
Ben, all I'm asking is that you go down there for a few months.
you work with the kids, you recharge.
download that epic resume where it's gonna do some good.
you can't always be the one in the water, Ben.
you'll know when you're ready to come back.
you people got 15 seconds to get off this bus.
move! Move! Let's go! Get off the bus!
instructor 1: Hurry up. IHSTRUCTOR 2: Let's go, let's go.
instructor 1: Put your white books in your red bags.
let's get that squared away now. Put those books away.
instructor 2: Females, grab your bags, fall out to the rear.
follow Chief Flight and Petty Officer Hall.
the rest of you, pick a bunk, put on your ODUs.
you started with 15 minutes, you are now down to 12.
move! Move, move, move!
move it out. Get changed out of those working blues.
hurry up. Move it out.
find your rack. Quit wasting my time.
Hey. Hey! That's my stuff, man.
Hey, that's his bunk.
you two a couple?
it's okay. I like the top better anyway.
Captain: Out of the 39, 000 men and women who make up the United States Coast Guard, there are only 280 rescue swimmers.
let's go! Let's go, mermaids!
this is because we are the Coast Guard's elite.
we are the best of the best.
when storms shut down entire ports, we go out.
when hurricanes ground the United States Navy, we go out.
and when the holy Lord himself reaches down from heaven and destroys his good work with winds that rip houses off the ground, we go out.
and the attrition rate at this school is well over 50%.
so if by some miracle you actually have what it takes to become one of us, then you get to live a life of meager pay with the distinct possibility of dying slow, cold and alone somewhere in the vast sea.
however, you also get the chance to save lives, and there is no greater calling in the world than that.
so, ladies and gentlemen, welcome. Welcome to "A" School.
are there any questions?
.JAKE: Captain, Airman Fischer. Just have one question.
that guy who holds all them records, is he still alive?
why do you ask?
I just thought you ought to let him know
I'm about to knock his name off that board.
Captain: Really? Why don't you let him know yourself?
he's standing right behind you in the back of the room.
class, turn around and greet Senior Chief Ben Randall.
senior Chief Randall will be your lead instructor for the next 18 weeks.
Ben, would you care to address the class?
no, I think there's been enough talk for one day.
chief Skinner, they're all yours.
SKINNER: Attention on deck.
carry on. - Aye, Captain.
pt test begins at 0700 tomorrow.
class dismissed. You will file through the front door.
first row first, followed by the second.
Frank.
when God rips houses off the ground"?
I was rolling.
and I didn't mean to put you on the spot up there.
and I was real sorry to hear about your crew.
come on. I'll show you around.
so I hear you're staying in a single? - Yeah.
Helens got some family business she's gotta take care of up there.
man ON RADIO: Mayday, mayday, mayday!
this is Ballmariner! Ballmariner!
we are on fire! We are on fire!
Instructor: Go!
let's go, let's go, let's go! - Let's go, logs.
let's move it out! Let's move it out!
work as a team! Work as a team!
two lines. - Two lines.
two lines. - Two lines.
do you understand me?
Yes, Petty Officer Hall.
very well, let's try it. Lean and rest!
pop tall.
CADETS: Oorah!
what the hell was that? - HALL: That was terrible.
IHSTRUCTOR: That was the worst I've ever seen.
that was terrible.
let's try that again.
CADETS: Twenty-two. SKINNER: Come on!
up! - Twenty-three.
down. Up.
Twenty-four. - Get that ass down, Cable!
up! - Twenty-five.
that is absolutely horrible.
pop tall to the lone pine and back! Go!
move your ass! Let's move it! Get it going!
let's go.
let's go.
bring them back.
circle back! - HALL: Let's go! Get back here!
get back in line! - IHSTRUCTOR: Let's move!
back in formation. - Let's move, move, move!
back in formation.
lean and rest. Senior Chief on deck.
pop tall.
CADETS: Oorah!
I don't care who you are, where you are from or where you are going.
I care about one thing and one thing only.
that is the future victims that you will be asked to save.
if I feel that you will fail them, I will fail you, understood?
Yes, Senior Chief!
Hodge. Where are you from, Hodge?
I'm from Teaneck, Hew Jersey, Senior Chief!
Hodge is our triple repeat.
do you plan on making it this time, threepeat?
I really hope to, Senior Chief.
Yeah, well, hope don't float, Hodge.
you better start to learn to swim against the current and not with it.
aye, aye, Senior Chief.
fisch.
fisch. Why are you here, Fisch?
I'm here to exceed your expectations, Senior Chief.
I'm a rescue swimmer at heart, born, bred and water-fed. Oorah!
Wow. I bet you practiced that all morning.
Mr. Fischer is our high school swim champ.
he's had scholarships to every lvy League.
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize that he was so qualified.
I mean, you set records in a pool?
that's amazing.
I'll bet it was like, what, eight feet deep in the deep end?
what if your nose plug didn't work?
what if another swimmer had cut into your lane?
for the love of God, you could have been killed.
your schedule says that you will perform a PT test this morning.
that will not be necessary.
water is where you've been called to serve.
water is where you will be tested.
this will serve in place of your PT in-test.
this is a golno-go exercise.
you will tread water for one hour.
you touch the wall, you fail. You touch the bottom, you fail.
you fail and you go home.
senior, this school operates on a two-challenge rule.
you can't throw them out on their first day.
if you cannot survive in a warm pool of water, then you have no business being here. Does this class understand?
CADETS: Yes, Senior Chief!
Oorah, Class 5506.
how, who here can tell me the rescue swimmer's motto?
so others may live," Senior Chief!
Oh, I feel safer already.
you willing to sacrifice your life so others may live, Goldfish?
Yes, I am, Senior Chief.
you will have to earn that right. I want all of you to think about that.
there's going to come a time when you reach the point of exhaustion and you wanna give up.
question is, will you?
SKINNER: There are three letters that will set you free.
dor. Drop on Request.
look at that.
waste of time.
you all right? - Hey. Come on, stay up.
cadet 1: Somebody help him out.
Hey, he's going under, man!
cadet 2: Help him out.
come on!
help him out. - Help him out!
guys, relax, man!
come on.
cadet 3: Come on, man.
you're dismissed.
I cramped up. - You're gone.
instructor 1: Let's go, Lyons, out of the water. Hurry up.
let's go. - INSTRUCTOR 1: Let's go.
on your feet.
first lesson in physics, people: Muscle does not float.
petty Officer Watson, pull them out of the pool.
aye, aye, Senior Chief.
let's go, people, out of the water.
hurry up! Let's move, people!
hurry up! Hurry up!
class leader, right here.
I thought you said you were willing to sacrifice your life for another.
I am, Senior Chief.
I wasrt aware we were working as a team, Senior Chief.
that's the only way we work, swim champ.
aye, aye, Senior Chief.
asshole.
come again? - You heard me.
Hey, hey, hey! Ease up! Ease up!
it's not won'th it. - Come on.
good news, Lyons. I think there's an opening on my buoy tender.
I'll put in a word for you, huh?
I'm really gonna miss that guy.
Hey, man, what are you doing? - Got your bunk back.
captain. - CAPTAIH: Ben. Come in.
you work fast.
lyons, he was one of our top candidates.
sometimes you gotta shoot a hostage.
look, we all know that you're a legend and all, but our program has been proven to work.
there's a gap between training and what really happens out there, Cujo.
Oh, really? - That's right.
my intention is to narrow that gap.
how, if someone has a problem with that idea,
I'd like to hear about it.
is this how it's gonna be, sir?
Yes, it is.
permission to be dismissed, sir? - CAPTAIH: Granted.
let's go. Let's go. Keep it together. Look tight!
keep it together. Let's go. Let's move.
you've got three minutes to get this gear on. All of it.
WATSOH: Set! Go!
Instructor: Let's go.
are you ready?
come on, rescue swimmer!
don't quit on me.
do you hear me?
do you hear me?
pop tall! Pop tall! Pop tall!
if you make a mistake, just fess up to it. Take your licks and we'll press on.
everybody now is gonna pay for your potty mouth.

Oorah.
Oorah.
Oorah!
can you die from chlorine poisoning?
I can't feel my legs. I'm serious.
I don't know about you guys, but I feel good.
this Randall guy, he's operating on some whole other cylinder.
what is it, two weeks, and he's failed almost half the class already?
he's a legend.
they say he's got something like 200 saves.
I heard it was 300.
who cares what his number is?
if he's such a stud, what's he doing here?
how we feeling, boys?
Hey, Z, where you going?
my sister's best friend is getting married, and they're having a big reception downtown.
I promised her I'd go.
wait, you said wedding reception?
Congratulations. - Thanks.
Hi.
Congratulations. - Hi.
Hice to meet you.
Ben: Yes, Kodiak, Alaska. The number for Helen Randall.
okay, try Helen Freeman.
you betcha.
Helen's VOICE: Hi, you've reached Helen. Leave a message.
Ben ON PHONE: Helen, it's Ben. Jesus, that was weird.
havert had to use your maiden name since we were kids.
Helen, if you're there, just pick up. We need to talk.
please.
all right. All right.
to those who have fallen, to those who have survived Phase 1.
Cheers. - LINDSEY: Cheers.
Oorah, oorah, oorah. - Guys, this is great.
and to our gal Lindsey. You can rescue me anytime.
did he just say that? - You did not just say that.
did he just say that? - You did not just say that.
you know what, Doran? You, I think I might actually let drown.
all: Oh!
Hey, Senior Chief.
Ben, she's hot tonight.
this place has not changed.
from Kodiak, Alaska... - Don't.
...Senior Chief Ben Randall is in the house, big as day and still alive.
I must owe somebody money.
you're terrible. - Oh, Ben.
I heard a rumor you were gonna be teaching here in town.
if that ain't the karmic wheel spinning, I don't know what is.
well. To the prodigal's return.
Where's your better half? - She decided to stay home.
Oh. - Work stuff.
Yeah. Winter in Kodiak. Let me see. Winter in Louisiana.
all right, stop. Stop. - She decided to stay home.
well, it's a good thing we got a full bottle and half the night.
Yes, we do.
check it out. She's staring at you.
that girl right there is not staring at me.
did you just point at her?
did she see you point? - I don't know.
all right, now you gotta go talk to her. You gotta go make a move.
Yeah. - I can't.
I just don't feel comfortable right now talking to women.
you're telling me you wanna jump out of helicopters - for a living... - You're talking to me.
...but you can't go talk to a girl?
that's exactly what I was telling you. - You're smooth.
all right, look, I'm gonna help you out here.
I'll show you how it's done.
pick out the hottest girl in here. I'll take her home.
Oh, gosh. - Okay.
here he go, now. - No, how about I will find the girl?
all right.
Okey-doke. - Who you thinking?
make sure she's hot.
where you looking? - Okay.
at the bar. Two o'clock.
Yes. - That's a good one.
CADET: There's no way in hell she's talking to you.
that one? - Yeah, that one.
boom.
that looks like a bet to me, Jake. - That's a bet.
all right. All right.
hundred bucks says I close in less than a minute.
Oh, absolutely.
hats off, man. - Tick-tock. Tick-tock. Tick-tock.
clock starts when I talk to her.
that's fine.
CADET: This is gonna be embarrassing.
all right, buddy.
CADET: What do you think? What do you got?
you think he's gonna do it? - CADET 2: Yeah.
evening, ma'am. Can I buy you a drink?
I don't think so.
you don't know what you're missing.
you sure you wanna go with that one?
that's, like, your top-of-the-line, A-game material?
see, the way I see it, you got two choices here:
walk away from me, or walk out of here with me and split the cash.
cash?
what cash?
the money you bet your friends you could pick me up.
see, that makes me nervous.
she's shutting him down.
how much time you got left?
about 20 seconds. - Shall we?
LINDSEY: Oh, my gosh. - Ho way.
it looks like they're leaving the bar together, is what I see.
cadet 2: Ho way!
you have got to be kidding me.
unbelievable. - How did he do that?
I'm impressed. - I'm impressed.
there's a bar outside your base called Maggie's. You know it?
Yeah.
good. Meet me there next Friday around 8: 00?
you got a name? - Yeah.
don't forget my money.
you got a middle name?
you do realize I can't go back in there.
this is the sound of death knocking.
sar alarms and sleep deprivation are part...
where the hell are they?
you know, the first stages of hypothermia are the most critical.
Why?
because you still have the ability to think. Say it.
CADETS: You still have the ability to think.
the decisions you make during this stage are gonna determine whether you live or die.
there a reason you're not breathing, Goldfish?
is there a reason why you're not breathing?
I don't know anyone who can stay alive without breathing
are you a coroner?
because pronouncing people dead is not part of our job description.
what do we always say?
CADETS: There's dead and then there's dead.
we never stop, Jake, not from the cabin to the tarmac.
we never stop. - Aye, aye, Senior Chief.
understood? - CADETS: Yes, Senior Chief.
okay, Jake, in the pool. Hodge, you're up.
you're with the dummy.
all right, now. Three letters.
three letters will get you people a cup of hot coffee and a blanket.
what do you say, Goldfish?
I'm actually not that cold anymore, Senior Chief.
you're not cold anymore because blood is moving from your outer extremities to your heart.
that's why your arms won't work.
you can plan on spending roughly 60% of your career in a mildly hypothermic state.
senior Chief, may I have a word?
sir?
why wasn't I informed of this? You know, we have classrooms.
your assignment is to simply teach the stages of hypothermia.
sir, in about two and a half minutes, they'll understand.
permission to carry on, sir?
go ahead.
three letters, people, will get you a hot cup of coffee and a warm blanket.
what do you say, Class 5506?
CADETS: Oorah.
Ben: This is an oxygen-deprivation anaerobic exercise.
you and your partner will push your brick along the bottom of the pool, down and back.
if you need air, you may surface. One breath.
your partner must remain underwater until you return.
your brick can only move while both of you are touching it.
if you both surface, you both fail.
this exercise is designed to teach you teamwork.
on my whistle, drop your gear, enter the pool and pair up.
I said one breath, Sunkist. Let's go!
I can't. - Come on!
I can't. - "I can't.
get your ass out of the pool! Let's go!
come on! Lean and rest.
you wanna quit, just quit now. I could use those new shoes.
senior Chief, we got a problem.
somebody's missing.
Jesus Christ.
that's gotta be a new record. Oorah.
I'm so sick of records. Go get him.
you think I'm impressed because you can hold your breath, Goldfish?
I wouldn't venture to say what would impress you, Senior Chief.
all right. Get him out of the pool. We're done for the day.
out of the pool, Fischer. Let's move.
Oorah! - Move your ass.
pop tall, Sunkist.
Instructor: Out of the pool. Out of the pool.
records.
hever stare directly into the flame, people.
it will impair your night vision.
SKINNER: This is a Mark 58 flare. This is what it looks like.
it'll light up a 50-foot swath of water and can be detected by infrared miles out.
this is a demonstration model.
the normal one will burn for 40 to 60 minutes.
Instructor: Hey, pay attention.
the Mark 58 is used to reference the wind, to detect a current.
petty Officer Watson is gonna talk a little bit more about that.
five minutes.
watson: The vessel you're looking at right now, people, is listing to the port side.
as a rescue swimmer, when you get to the door of the helicopter, you need to look down and pay attention to what you really have down there.
it's very important that you understand your limitations.
limitations without understanding are gonna get you killed.
case in point, this vessel's trapped in pancake ice in the Bering Sea.
and as you can see, the crew are out on the deck in a relatively manageable hoisting position.
but suddenly...
those pieces of ice can weigh in upwards of thousands of pounds.
how imagine yourself trapped in between 2, 000-pound pieces of ice trying to free-swim.
thank you, Chief.
Hext scenario, Petty Officer Watson.
watson: Before you leave that helicopter, going down to a...
standardization is one of the reasons we were so successful during Katrina.
we had crews come in from all over the country, but it didn't matter, because we have all been trained the same way.
I didn't know my pilot, I didn't know my copilot,
I didn't know my flight mechanic. But guess what?
it didn't matter, because...
that's why we do it.
so you have to get your mind wrapped around that idea.
when that helicopter starts going, when the wind starts coming...
CADETS: Twenty! HALL: Down! Up!
Twenty-one! - Down! Up!
Twenty-two! - Down! Up!
Twenty-three!
two! - Down!
up! - Three!
don't need no land Don't need no tree
out in the water That's where I wanna be - Hey, Mags, can I have a beer? - MAGGIE: Sure.
well, well.
so you are gonna have a drink with me.
no, I'm having a drink near you. Entirely different thing.
you're a regular lightning rod, aren't you?
what's your name? - Daisy Buchanan.
you're lying, Daisy Buchanan.
there is that possibility. - No.
that was a sure-fire lie.
so I take it you've read The Great Gatsby.
Where's my money? - It's not on me.
but it is close. In a very safe place.
how, I've drawn a map with a complex set of clues.
each one is more fiendishly clever than the last.
that works, too.
this is just a picture of your pants.
Yeah, but it's a bad picture, which is what makes it so fiendishly clever.
nice.
how did Emily Thomas become a schoolteacher?
well, how does Jake Fischer become a guy who wants to jump out of helicopters?
I killed a couple guys and had to get out of Dodge.
you're lying. - There is that possibility.
the truth.
my bull-riding career was going down the drain.
okay, that's better. - All right, now you.
I really should go.
go? What? No, you're not going.
we're just starting to have fun. You're insulting my drawing.
no, you were insulting your drawing.
although, to be fair, it's a pretty lame drawing.
all right. Well, you can't go, 'cause you owe me a dance.
no, I don't think so.
well, then, I'm gonna have to take that money back, cause I wouldn't feel right taking the money...
look, every 18 weeks, a new bunch of you guys comes in, all looking to score with the local talent.
I live here. I work here.
it's a good thing I'm just asking for a dance, then.
okay, one dance.
ho attachments. Just casual.
I'm a guy. I can do casual.
Mmm-hmm.
I am the king of casual.
there's just one thing, though.
you're gonna have to stop undressing me with your eyes, cause there's no way you're getting me into bed.
Hey, you.
I gotta get to work.
I'm late. I fell asleep. - What...
they're gonna kill me. - They won't kill you.
this isn't like school.
they don't hand out tardies in the military.
you smell really good. - I smell like you.
he never came back? - Hope.
Wow.
four years as lead instructor, I never had one go missing.
all right, take the others to the pool. I'll catch up.
aye, aye, Senior.
Oh, God, there they are. Stop. Stop the car. Stop.
here? - Yes.
okay. - I'll call you.
you better. Bye.
Emily: Jake! Jake! Jake!
SKINNER: Airman Fischer's coming in late, yeah
here.
CADETS: Airman Fischer's coming in late, yeah
Hi.
must be nice to go out on a date, yeah
must be nice to go out on a date, yeah
Oh, my goodness, look at this.
look at this. "Freshman Leads Team to State Title."
that's you.
holy smokes.
at only 16, Jake Fischer displays the traits of a seasoned athlete.
one thing's for sure: The future looks bright for this young competitor.
guess they didn't know you were gonna flunk out of "A" School.
you have a nice evening?
get dressed.
think we need another brick. Bring it in.
goldfish.
goldfish.
thanks to Mr. Fischer's extracurricular activities, you have all now gone 36 hours without sleep.
blow it.
class leader, you are done. Form it up in the shallow end.
aye, Senior Chief!
class 5506, form it up!
no. No, no, no. You're with me.
I'm a rescue swimmer, yes, I am
I'm here to pull your ass out of this jam
I jump from the helo and swing from the cable
all right, knock it off.
I am having a hard time figuring you out, Fischer.
I mean, you like seeing your picture in the paper.
in it for the glory, maybe a few chicks. Am I right?
but when it comes down to it, you will choose yourself over them every time, like you did on the first day in the pool, like you did yesterday by missing muster.
wort happen again, Senior Chief!
why don't you do us both a big favor and quit?
I'm a rescue swimmer, yes, I am
I'm here to pull your ass out of this jam
I jump from the helo and swing from the cable
I'm not Tarzan I'm just willing and able
give me something else, Senior Chief.
CADETS: Thirty!
Thirty-one!
Thirty-two!
Thirty-three!
Thirty-four!
Thirty-five!
Thirty-siX!
stop. Drop them.
senior Chief's on deck. Pop tall.
CADETS: Oorah!
morning, class.
today we were going to learn about how to approach a drowning victim in high seas, but I think there are some here who aren't interested in that victim.
fact, I think there's some in this class who aren't interested in saving lives at all.
I believe there are some who are more interested in setting records.
so today is record day.
put one on the board for Goldfish.
wow, he's fast.
he's good.
you got it, man! You got it, Fisch!
another record. Chalk it up, Chief.
get some. - You are the man!
you people do not deserve to be in the same pool as Jake.
he's destroying you.
wow, look at him go! He's fast!
wow, he's fast.
come on, you're all fighting for second. Just first loser.
this is fun.
we'll pass out trophies later.
unbelievable.
unbelievable.
you want me to pull these pansies out?
you do not wanna hear about my day. - Yeah, I do.
man, this guy Randall...
you know, it doesn't matter what I do. It's just not good enough.
well, maybe he's just trying to push you to be better.
you know, we teachers do that to the ones we believe in.
no, it's personal with me.
he knows that I'm better than he was.
I mean, today, I broke every one of his records.
I own them all.
hot all of them.
there's one record you won't break.
this is the Aegis.
medical ship. Caught on fire.
it was a nightmare. People burning in their beds.
and Ben Randall got every one of those people off there, except for this one guy.
and right when the ship started to go down, he reaches down and grabs this guy.
he's hanging from the cable with this mars life in his hands, and the winch jams.
it's 20 minutes to the base. The mars screaming.
Ben looks him dead in the eye, and you know what he said?
he said, "I won't let go.
what happened?
MAGGIE: Dislocated his shoulder, tore every tendon in his hand.
but he didn't let go.
twenty minutes, just fingertips.
you break that record and you give me a call.
my day was all right.
so here's my thinking. We should go on a date.
well, what do you call this? - No, no, no.
I'm talking about, like, a real date.
you know, with, like, a nice restaurant, some nice clothes.
I'll get you some flowers.
I thought we agreed to keep this casual.
look, it's one steak. What is...
one steak is not gonna forge some kind of a lasting emotional bond.
I'm serious.
yeah?
Yeah. - So am I.
it's one dinner. What's it gonna hurt?
well, if you ordered a steak, I'd imagine a cow would be involved.
what do you have, an art gallery over here? What is this "2"?
it's so the guy behind me knows what place he's coming in.
what about this one?
that is the initials of the guys on my high school relay team.
a drunken celebration gone wrong?
something like that.
so, about this date. - God. It's just dinner, right?
no flowers, where we will discuss nothing emotional or important?
I am fully prepared to do an entire hour on nothing but the Chicago Bears.
and we can have completely meaningless sex immediately afterwards.
you think I'm gonna sleep with you on our first date?
think again.
you just head-butted me.
I'm gonna teach you the breaststroke.
it's pretty complicated, different than that of the butterfly.
I guess I can't sleep.
well, of course you can't.
your wife left you. Your best friend died.
you sound like a damn country song.
if you had a dog, he'd be run over by now.
so, did she send you papers? - Yeah.
and did you read them?
no, I did not.
well, you think you might ought to?
you know, there never was anyone else, Mags.
like hell, Ben.
you're a bigamist.
you been married to the Coast Guard all along.
give me that shoulder.
you probably swum it out of socket trying to prove you're still 19.
am I right?
when the heck did we get old?
hell, I've always been old, Ben.
you know what, though? I don't mind.
I mean, if my muscles ache, it's 'cause I've used them.
if it's hard for me to walk up them steps now, it's 'cause I walked up them every night to lay next to a man who loved me.
I got a few wrinkles here and there, but I've laid under thousands of skies on sunny days, yeah.
I look and feel this way, well, 'cause I drank and I smoked,
I lived and I loved, and danced, sang, sweat and screwed my way through a pretty damned good life, if you ask me.
getting old ain't bad, Ben.
getting old, that's earned.
Ben: There will come a time when you might have to decide who lives and dies out there.
it's a terrible responsibility,
reporter 2: Further explosions are unfolding in Tikrit, which is Saddam Hussein's ancestral hometown.
... as well as blows from similar explosions are unfolding...
reporter 3: Just a few seconds ago, another huge blast shook this city.
cruise missiles and airstrikes raining down here in a relentless assault on Baghdad.
there is no doubt tonight that war has begun...
... and the Iraqi capital is experiencing shock and awe.
soldier ON RADIO: Approaching target site three-five-niner.
all right, everybody, listen up.
it is a military storage site. Diwaniya.
intel estimates possible nerve agents, choking agents, live pathogens, chemical-tipped missiles.
101st has been here all morning, so the site is secure.
everybody stay focused. This is it.
shots fired, right side, 100 meters, tops.
we got shots fired. Right side, 100 meters.
let's go. Move. Move!
okay. Go ahead.
who's the officer in charge?
move! Move! Move!
Hey! Who's in charge?
right here. Lieutenant Asira.
chief Miller, Met-Delta.
what the fuck are all these looters doing here?
this is a WMD site. This is a high-priority site.
look, I don't even have enough men to set up the perimeter.
we got a sniper in this tower right here.
in the big tower on the back?
in the big tower on the back.
I do not have enough men to go in and secure the inside of that compound.
listen, listen. Intel says we got live chemical agents in this site.
okay, we gotta move now! These looters...
I don't know what these people are carrying out right now.
I gotta get into this site. I'm going in.
chief, you can't go in.
if you take your team in right now, it's on you.
gather around. Gather around. Come on. Listen, here's the situation.
101st sent 35 men and one butter bar down here.
they don't even have this place secure, so here's where we are right now.
now, the weapons are in the northwest end of the complex.
there's a sniper holed up in the big tower there.
we're going to have to quickly take him out.
I'm going to take a recon element forward. I'm going to need C-BIST.
Marshall and Johnson, you come with me. Yes, sir.
two shooters, Potts, Michaels. I'm going to need EOD.
Conway, bring Simms also. Right here, sir.
soldier: Ready, Chief. All right, stand by.
chief, I gotta talk to you. This is fucked.
listen, this is a disaster.
it is a disaster. They haven't secured dick.
I don't think we should go in yet, Chief. Let's get some acceptable intel.
no, no, no. Look at this! Jerry, I got no idea what's coming out here.
I gotta go right now.
keep comms open. I'll be on five.
get a second team ready.
WILKINS: Let's go! Move! Move!
guys, get that shit off the truck now.
soldier: Roger that.
C-BIST? Right here, Chief.
I want you to stay right on the backs of your shooters, all right?
they will take you in. Roger that, Chief.
all right. We ready?
WILKINS: Yes, sir! Let's go. Go! Go! Go!
soldier: Move! Move!
the sniper! Hey, Sarge! Where is he?
he's right up there, but we can't get down the alley.
okay, everyone, listen up.
Michaels! Michaels, listen. Hey!
the WMD are in this building. I need you to work your way to the rear door here.
see if you can get an angle on that sniper.
I want you to take C-BIST with you. Take Simms, also, with the long rifle.
michaels: Got it, Chief.
miller: Hey, I gotta get across this alley.
I need some cover fire, all right?
okay.
when the 203 goes, we're going to go all the way down on the left side.
all right. Stand by. Roger that, Chief.
miller: Let's go.
soldier: Met-Delta team, go!
conway: Move, move! Let's go!
move! Move!
miller: I got him. He's on the fifth floor, southeast corner room.
I'm going to draw him out.
as soon as you see him, take him.
michaels: Roger.
now! Now! Now!
got him?
we got him. Three coming out.
miller: Michaels, send C-BIST over.
go! Go! Go!
Potts, Keating, go! Go!
second team, move! Let's go! Move! Move!
WILKINS: Move it!
in.
soldier: Check. Check. Let's do it.
all right. Break out the gear. I want everyone in full MOPP.
WILKINS: Now you heard Chief. Get ready. Roll those seals tight.
I got it.
conway: No readings in here, Chief.
miller: All right, Conway, open it up.
soldier: Nothing but toilet parts over here.
is this all pigeon shit?
PERRY: Yeah, thing looks like it's been here about 10 years.
miller: Yep.
this is no WMD site.
soldier: Pack it up.
WILKINS: Hey, Chief, we find anything?
the site's empty.
WILKINS: Standing by.
Hey, where did that intel come from?
do you want me to double check the target number for you? Because I can.
no, no, we're in the right location. The schematic's right.
but who did it originate with? I mean...
Hey, did this come from the United Nations?
according to this data, Chief, this is our intel.
Yeah, but how would they think something was there?
this is the third straight time.
let's go.
WILKINS: You heard the chief. Move out.
all right, pack this shit up and let's go.
soldier: Roger that!
let's go! Move!
soldier: Step on it. Let's go.
Zubaidi will be on the middle chopper. Get tight on his exit.
swing it around. Swing it around.
reporter 1: The DOD guy's here to meet him.
male REPORTER: Reporting to you live from the tarmac here...
reporter 1: Ready for the close-up? Go, go, go!
reporter 2: That's Poundstone from DOD.
how's it going?
great day.
LAWRIE: Yup, you finally got him here.
well, we feel like we're making progress. That's important.
so, what about the weapons?
I'm frustrated by that, too.
we're doing everything we can. We'll find the weapons, don't worry about it.
the whole world's watching. They want to know where they are.
make sure Zubaidi and I are in the lead car, okay?
Jack, I want your guys to tail us.
you got it, sir.
Clark! -What?
I need the source. I need Magellan.
do you have any idea how sensitive this is?
we've got Magellan locked up so tight, I'm not even sure I can get to him.
you're the administration's go-to guy and you can't access your own source?
lawrie, we're debriefing him.
it takes time. That comes first.
for Christ's sake, I've given you everything I got on the guy so far.
what more do you want? I don't want to hear it from you,
I want to hear it from him.
I'll see what I can do.
how are you?
welcome home, sir. We'll make this very brief.
reporter 1: How does it feel to be back, Mr. Zubaidi?
did you ever think you'd see this day?
I'm an Iraqi citizen, returning free to the city of my birth.
I call on all Iraqis to celebrate our liberation from tyranny.
soldier: Bravo one, we've got two mechanics taking a look at it.
tracking on the up gun is pretty well shot and the comm links are all shorted out.
what's the time frame on a replacement?
man: I want a squad list, now!
Hey, where's Colonel Bethel?
he's in the back, Chief.
thank you.
WILKINS: Roy, let me meet you over here, okay?
Yeah, I'll meet you in there.
Hey, sir. Good to see you, Chief.
what's going on with the intel?
you don't want to get into that right now.
well, we gotta talk about it. There's nothing there. These sites are empty.
we're going to be very careful, or there's going to be a huge shitstorm around here.
what do you mean?
they're blaming us for not moving fast enough.
we have to stay on task.
that's bullshit. The intel's no good.
let's not make any waves, okay?
they don't want to hear that back in Washington.
all they're interested in is finding something they can hold up on CNN.
sir, but we gotta talk about this. The intel is a problem.
now is not the time, Chief.
officer: Roo! On your feet!
take your seats, people.
bethel: We're here this morning to give the General a check on where we are in our search for WMD and what our plans are for the next 48 hours.
to that end, I'm turning the floor over to Captain Jonathan Vaught.
captain. Sir.
welcome, sir.
today we're going to be briefing you on WMD operations due to take place in and around the Baghdad area over the next 24 hours.
we're continuing to target high-priority sites, since all the folks back home are anxiously awaiting the information that we found these weapons.
we have a detailed media plan we've worked out.
we've coordinated with the public-affairs folks.
we have a good plan that involves the top-rated media in the United States and the UK so that they're prepared to cover all aspects of the good news.
yeah? I had a couple questions about the intel for tomorrow.
are we sure this is accurate?
it's solid. It's good to go.
what's the source?
Gonzales: Well, it's a human-source intel.
but it's solid. It's current as of 0400.
was it the same source we've been using?
every site we've hit on the way up here, we've rolled a donut.
chief, how about we do this? Let's talk offline.
give me a list of the places where you went, and the grids, and we'll make sure that you had the right information written down and that you went to the right places, okay?
captain, the issue isn't the grids, sir. The issue's that there's nothing there.
stand down, Chief. We need to move on here.
don, hold on. Hold a second. Let's hear what the chief has to say.
okay, sir, I'll give you an example.
we rolled into a site, Diwaniya, last week, okay?
101st took casualties securing it for us.
we got in there and found it was a toilet factory.
I'm saying there's a disconnect between what's in these packets and what we're seeing on the ground.
there's a problem with the intelligence, sir.
here's the thing, Chief.
these intelligence packages have all been vetted.
they're good.
your job's to execute them, not worry about how they're put together.
are we clear on that?
Yes, sir.
good. Let's continue.
VAUGHT: Sir, as I was saying, the intel is as recent as 0400 this morning.
it's actionable and it's solid.
all right, next up is Al Mansour, Baghdad.
it looks like it's some kind of underground storage site.
you got about 12 klicks of open highway to the city, but there's a lot of activity on that road, so tell everybody to keep their heads up.
all right.
chief?
all right. We're going to go chem. Yeah?
I'm gonna get all the lead teams up, all right?
Yeah, yeah.
martin Brown, CIA.
Roy Miller.
Yeah, I know. I saw you at the meeting.
you're going to the Al Mansour site in Baghdad.
Yeah. You're wasting your time.
un biological team hit it two months ago.
there's nothing there.
fuck me.
here's my card. You're right.
this thing doesn't add up.
the Iraqis don't fight, they don't use WMD, they let us walk in here and find the goddamn cupboard's bare.
there's something wrong here.
we gotta figure out what it is.
if you find anything, you've got my number.
soldier ON RADIO: That's affirmative. That's affirmative.
we took on some fire about four klicks back.
pretty light, though. Nothing to worry about.
johnson: Oh, I gotta get some pictures of this.
potts: Be my guest.
heads up. Incoming.
fucking Potts, you red-headed dick.
Hey, Wilkins, this is Chief. Get up here.
WILKINS: Hold on!
yo, Kurry, let's go.
please, get back. Please.
I want you to get a couple of the guys and clear out this traffic.
we're too exposed out here. We gotta keep moving.
back from the truck. Sir, take it easy.
please.
please, step aside.
I need you to move the vehicle, sir.
Hey, hey, relax.
easy!
soldier: Don't you fucking touch me!
motherfucker, let's go.
Hey! SOLDIER: Shut the fuck up.
back the fuck up!
Hey! Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey!
what's going on, Sergeant?
chief, they're pissed off.
they say there ain't no water. All they want is water.
miller: There's nothing we can do about that.
we just gotta get our vehicles moving.
I want you to get the men back in the vehicles now.
Hey! Hey! SOLDIER: Get in the fucking car!
get the fuck back! Get the fuck back in your vehicle!
back from the truck. Get back from the truck.
don't stop. DRIVER: No, sir.
okay, so we're convening an Iraqi Freedom convention here inside the Green Zone tomorrow.
we are expecting to have representatives from all three main ethnic groups, the Kurds, the Shia and the Sunni, angling for different levels of power.
it is our hope that Ahmed Zubaidi will emerge in a leadership position.
Ben, are you satisfied that we're in a good place now?
I think we're in a good place now, except for, perhaps, the press we're getting from this looting issue.
okay, well, let's table that for now.
in terms of stabilization...
Zubaidi hasn't been here for 30 years.
well, he's the best bet we have right now for a stable democracy.
you find me 10 guys in Baghdad who even know who he is.
well, he's our friend, Marty. He's been very helpful.
our office is extremely satisfied with all the information that we've gotten from him.
Zubaidi's been selling us a crock of shit for years.
this guy is not reliable. His intelligence is not reliable.
his report chain is not reliable.
this is exactly why people are losing confidence in the Agency, Marty.
you're questioning every single piece of intelligence that's coming in, up to the point where we can't make any progress.
you cannot just hand this country over to an exile no one's ever heard of and a bunch of interns from Washington.
well, you're a Middle East expert, Marty.
if you got a better idea, why don't you just throw it out here on the table?
we need to use the Iraqi army to help us.
this country is a powder keg of ethnic division.
now Saddam is gone, they're the only ones who can hold this place together.
we're not selling that to the American people.
we beat the Iraqi army. Right.
well, they're still out there and they're armed, and they're looking for a place in the new Iraq.
they're going to be waiting a long time.
they didn't all follow Saddam.
there are officers we can work with out there, if we make it worth their while.
Hey, let me tell you something.
we've spent too much American treasure and too many American lives for us to put a Ba'athist general into a position of power.
have you any idea what's going on outside the Green Zone?
it's chaos. No police, revenge killings every night.
people are asking why we can't stop this.
we are losing the population. Democracy is messy.
democracy is messy.
if you dismantle this country and cut out the army, you'll have civil war in six months.
I guarantee it.
okay, let's move on.
soldier: We are continuing to hold at the intersection at Alpha-Charlie-three.
PERRY: Calm down!
FREDDY: Listen to me, please!
just listen. PERRY: Sergeant Wilkins!
PERRY: Get on the ground! FREDDY: My arm!
Hey, what's going on over there, Wilkins?
WILKINS: Chief, there's a local here. He's out of control.
Perry had to tackle him.
I'm on my way.
miller: All right, back up.
PERRY: You stay the fuck down.
what's going on? FREDDY: You are hurting me!
what's going on here, Sergeant?
WILKINS: This Hajji says he needs to talk to you about something.
I have no idea. He goes on and on and on.
stay down.
FREDDY: Why are you doing this? Why you do it?
you agree someone do this to you?
miller: Hey, Perry. Perry.
you let him up. Let him up.
FREDDY: You agree?
up? I can stand up now?
why you are doing this, huh? Why you are doing this?
you agree someone put your head in the dust like this?
you agree to be treated like this? This is not fair!
Hey, calm down.
I'm trying to calm down, but this guy, he put me on the floor!
are you finished?
Yeah, I'm finished.
what's your name?
my name is Farid Youssef Abdul Rahman. You call me Freddy, okay?
I have information. I was driving like five minutes from here.
I saw some people, you know, like Saddam's men, like Ba'athist people.
they are meeting. They have a meeting near to here.
I saw you are... I don't know, you're digging here, and I come to tell you. Okay, just calm down. Hey! Hey! Hey!
calm down. Calm down.
why should I believe you, Freddy?
you think it's easy to come and talk to American?
you think it's easy? I come here, all these people, they're looking at me?
you stick me on the floor. I want to speak to you quietly, huh.
and you are digging in the ground.
why you are digging in the ground?
you need to talk to these people. You know what they are saying?
you think someone can put something in this place with all these people watching and all these people don't know?
it's not logical.
I am here to help you, okay, Miller?
come with me, Freddy. Come with me.
WILKINS: Chief, you good?
Yeah, I'm fine.
soldier: Sir, come this way, please.
Hey, Chief! Chief, what are we doing?
Hey, I'm gonna need his car keys. Freddy, give him your car keys.
my keys?
chief, you don't believe this guy, do you?
look, I wanna go real low-vis on this.
I want to take Freddy's car and I want to get maybe one other.
if we roll over there in those Humvees, they're going to see us coming.
I want to take Keating, Potts, Bronner on comms.
you gotta get me Michaels with the SAW and bring Perry over here.
what's up, Chief?
Hey, you guys ready to go to work?
hell, yeah, Chief.
chief, let me talk to you, please.
what?
chief, our mission is here.
what, you wanna sit around and dig holes all day?
I want to get something done.
miller: All right, here's the situation.
this Iraqi just showed up with information that about two or three "K" west of here, there's a meeting taking place right now, possible high-value targets involved.
so I want to move on it.
in the first car, I want to take the Iraqi guy, Freddy.
keating, you're going to drive, I'll ride shotgun.
Potts, you're in the back covering Freddy the entire time.
the rest of you guys are going to roll in the pick-up truck. Any questions?
Hey, Chief, how do we know this guy isn't leading us into a fucking ambush?
we don't.
get your fucking game face on.
Roger.
Hooah. ALL: Hooah!
all right, let's roll. You're not letting me drive, huh?
no, you're not driving.
PERRY: Weapons ready.
it's Freddy, right? I'm Potts. Nice to meet you.
soldier: Fire it up!
okay, Sergeant Perry, I want you to carry on straight.
take your next left, take your next left and go around the back.
PERRY: Roger that, Chief.
FREDDY: And if you stop here, it is the house on that corner.
miller: Okay, pull up here. Pull up here.
okay, be advised, it is the house on the southeast corner.
the big white house with the wall.
heads up. Someone's coming out.
there were six or seven men with guns.
all right, we got a guy with a briefcase and another with an AK-47.
Perry, where are you? You in position?
PERRY: In position, Chief. We got them.
black BMW with three men.
miller: I want to take the BMW.
as soon as he comes up our way, we're going to cut him off.
I want to take the BMW and then the house. Go, go, go.
go, go, go!
out of the fucking car! Get the fuck out of the car, now!
Perry, get on that door.
get on that door.
zip him up. Bronner, stay with him.
everybody else, go, go, go, go, go!
on me. Stack on me.
miller: Let's go! Let's go! Go, go, go!
on the fucking ground, now!
all right, down, down, down.

I've got no exit. Where's the back door? Michaels, with me!
keating, on the stairs up!

miller: Taking fire!

miller: Get ready to hook right.

this is Potts, got one wrapped up.
keating, all clear out front.
chief, this is Perry. I need you up here right away.

it's okay. Your husband is okay. Perry!
PERRY: Look, Chief, you gotta do something.
they don't understand what the fuck I'm saying.
this is the mother, that's the mother. Enough! Enough.
tell her to calm down. Say, "Calm down.
I don't understand her, Chief It's a different dialect.
don't let her leave. Don't let any of them leave this room.
there's a body down there. Don't let them leave.
PERRY: You got it, Chief.
ma'am, you can't go downstairs.
you cannot go downstairs. Stay down.
potts: Shut up! Shut up!
soldier: Watch yourself, Potts.
miller: Get Freddy in here. Stand him up. I gotta talk to him.
Freddy, come here.
I don't want this. Hey, I need you to...
I come to you for information. I don't want this.
listen, I need you to ask him questions for me.
tell him you're my translator.
ask him... Hey, what is this shit?
what is this? Is this on him?
Yeah, that was fucking in his back pockets.
FREDDY: He says he doesn't do anything.
ask him his name.
his name's Seyyed Hamza.
Seyyed Hamza. Is this his house?
is this your house?
Hey, listen, tell him he's gonna answer my questions or things are going to go very bad for him.
ask him what the meeting was about.
chief, I just got off the phone.
that license plate belongs to General Mohammed Al Rawi.
the Jack of Clubs.
michaels: Shut the fuck up!
Hey, Michaels, do you have that deck of cards?
Yes.
miller: Give me the Jack of Clubs.
potts: Is that the guy? Was that the guy that went out the back?
michaels: Here it is, Chief.
let me see. Let me see.
potts: Is that the guy? That's the guy. I just saw this guy.
bullshit! That's the fucking guy.
I just saw him downstairs.
this man. This is Saddam's top general.
al Rawi? You know who this is? Al Rawi?
he say he don't know.
al Rawi's in this house?
this is the guy I saw.
okay, okay. Time's up. Okay, get everybody ready. We're leaving.
miller: All right, he's got to know about WMD. He's coming with me.
Hey, Freddy, I want you to come with me.
Hey, Michaels! What's up, Chief?
bring them all over to the wall.
Potts, I want you to get the guy. Get the guy and bring him to me.
Roger that, Chief.
just sit him down against the wall. Yes, sir.
sit those guys over there.
miller: Come over here, Freddy. Come here. I need you to translate.
tell him I want to know about weapons of mass destruction.
does he know where the weapons are?
what? What? What do you know about weapons?
where are the weapons?
he say only General Mohammed Al Rawi, he know about these things.
the special program is under his hand personally.
he's the only one who know the truth about these things.
okay, how do I find Al Rawi?
how do I find Al Rawi?
he said, can you protect his family?
if you protect my family, I will tell you how you find Mohammed.
and then from him you will know the truth.

I got a colonel waiting on these guys.
I got orders to get these guys back there.

Yeah, I got him. He says some guy took a book off him.

Hey!
Where's Freddy?
soldier: You mean the guy with the limp? Yeah.

WILKINS: Fuck! I thought you were watching him.
Where's my weapon? Where's my weapon? Right here!
I gave him the book. I gave him the fucking book!

get everyone back to the trucks.
potts: Roger.
Hey, let's go. Let's go.
what more I have to do for you? Huh?
I come to you with information. You take the information, it's right.
you want the book. I have the book. I give you the book.
you think I can leave my car?
you know what this car, it means to me?
even you have the key!
what happened to your leg?
my leg is in Iran.
since 1987.
me, too, I fight for my country.
Freddy, listen. You give me your information.
I'm going to get you a reward for what you did today.
reward?
you think I do this for money?
you think I don't care about my country? I see what's happening.
you don't think I see what's happen in it?
and all the people now, even they have no water, they have no electricity.
you think I do this for reward?
you don't think I do this for me?
for my future? For my country? For all these things?
whatever you want here, I want more than you want.
I want to help my country.
who is this?
Hey, this is Chief Miller.
I have something I think you'd be interested in.
martin: Listen, I don't have time to play games. Just tell me what you've got.
well, this morning I came face to face with Mohammed Al Rawi.
general Al Rawi?
Yeah, the Jack of Clubs.
martin: Come in and talk to me.
I'm in the Green Zone, Republican Palace. By the pool.
I'm on my way. WILKINS: Listen, make sure Johnson runs checks...
Hey, Sergeant Wilkins, I gotta talk to you.
we gotta go get our prisoner back, find this guy, Al Rawi.
let Bethel handle it, please.
no. Bethel can't see past the files on his desk.
so, what, you're going to ring the doorbell now and ask Special Forces to hand him over? No.
I'm going to use the book and trade up and get some help.
what are you talking about?
Jerry, why the fuck do we keep coming up empty on all these sites?
there has gotta be a reason.
chief, we're here to do a job and get home safe.
that's all. The reasons don't matter.
they matter to me.
with all due respect, Chief, I can't go with you on this.
understood. I'm going to split the team.
I'm going to take my crew plus Sergeant Perry.
you report back to Bethel with everyone else, hooah?
Hooah.
Hey, Freddy. You want a job?
Yes.
good. Get in your car, follow us.
driver: Where to, Chief?
republican Palace.
this is not a good time, Lawrie.
I've waited long enough.
I told you, I'm doing the best I can.
this is not what I signed up for, Clark.
I put my reputation on the line with these stories.
I am not going to let you hang me out to dry.
well, there's huge things at stake here.
I'm not going to let them be compromised because you need to sell some newspapers.
you knew the deal. I give you Magellan, you give me anonymity.
listen, Clark, I'm done waiting, so is the paper.
you won't help me find Magellan, I'm going to find someone who can.
right here.
tourist: Can you get me some more beers? Frisbee!
miller: Oh, shit!
Oh, my goodness. We got enough time for that?
these guys got Domino's Pizza and fucking beer?
tourist: Get in the pool, man.
sergeant Perry, I've gotta go talk to this guy, so you all are on your own for a little while.
Roger that.
can we have beer?
PERRY: Not one.
so, what happened?
we were digging at a site.
local come up to us and give us a tip that there was a meeting going on with some high-value targets nearby.
we hit the house, and it turned out the guy was right. Al Rawi was there.
you sure it was him? Positive.
he had a security detail with him, and we exchanged fire with them and he slipped out during the firefight.
now that's the book that I took off this guy, Seyyed Hamza.
he was the host of the meeting.
and I was in the process of figuring out what the fuck it was when SF showed up and snatched him.
God damn!
okay, but where did they take him?
because if you can get me access to this guy,
I'll get Al Rawi.
look, we're both after the WMD, right?
it's a little more complicated than that.
well, not to me, it isn't.
all right, I'll make a call, get you reassigned.
there are some empty buildings on the other side of the compound.
get out of uniform and report to my office in an hour.
outstanding.
how'd you get the bloody nose?
Oh, that's a long story.
you're in the 85th. That's WMD unit, right?
how did you know that?
it's right there on your rifle.
lawrie Dayne, Wall Street Journal. How's it going?
you know, we haven't found shit yet. Hey, Sergeant Perry.
we'll find it. It's frustrating, right?
little bit.
so what are you and Marty talking about?
Oh, you know I can't talk to you about that.
Oh, come on.
you come in fresh off the field to have a lemonade with Martin Brown?
something's gotta be going on.
well, you could ask him.
I'm asking you.
does it make sense to you that we're still coming up empty?
no. No, it doesn't.
someone told us they were there, right?
if you come across anything, call me.
I'll keep it in mind.
INTERROGATOR: Where's he hiding? Where's Al Rawi?
translator: Where's Al Rawi?
how long have they been going?
for about 10 minutes.
INTERROGATOR: You want to see your wife and kids again? You have five kids.
you want them to see their father?
translator: He says, "Please, do not involve my family in this situation.
I swear to God...
INTERROGATOR: You're involved, so your family's involved.
all I want is an answer, where to look for this man, and you can walk out of here.
Where's Al Rawi? TRANSLATOR: Where's Al Rawi?
INTERROGATOR: And I want a name or an address.
somewhere I can find General Al Rawi.
I am going to get an answer, and you know you're going to tell me something.
all right, I'm going to let go and you're going to give me an address.
Where's Al Rawi? Where is he?
the book! The book!
translator: He says you need the book.
the fucking book again? What's in the book?
translator: "The book, that's how you'll find him.
it has the names and locations of Al Rawi's safe houses.
chief Miller around?
Yeah. Up the stairs, down on the right.
Hey, Chief, Clark Poundstone, Pentagon Special Intelligence Unit.
a great job bagging Hamza.
Thanks. Appreciate it.
walk you out?
sure.
you're with our MET Team, right? Yeah.
well, the administration really appreciates the work you guys are doing.
we gotta get this WMD issue behind us so we can get on with the challenges of the future.
that's where this Hamza guy could be helpful.
he's confirmed a few facts for us.
says your guys might have lifted a notebook from him.
well, everything I got off him I gave to Martin Brown.
why don't you ask him if he's got it?
I don't think Marty would go for that.
he's a hell of a guy, but he's been in the Middle East a long time.
he's got a lot of preconceived ideas.
our unit's trying to get back to the raw intel.
look, I don't want to throw Marty under a bus, but he doesn't like what we're coming up with.
the guy's a dinosaur, and we need to get some new thinking going on around here.
there's an opportunity for you here, Miller.
I know Marty's pulled you in temporarily, but if you're looking for something more permanent, I can help.
we're doing a good thing here. We're going to rebuild this place.
people are watching us.
I'll keep it in mind.
you do that.
if you hear anything about that notebook, let me know.
I've got my hairspray and radio. I'm ready to go. The rats on the street. All dance around my feet. They seem to say: "Tracy, it's up to you
so oh, oh, don't hold me back 'Cause today all my dreams will come true Good morning, Baltimore There's the flasher who lives next door There's the bum on his barroom stool They wish me luck on my way to school Good morning, Baltimore And someday when I take to the floor The world's gonna wake up and see Baltimore and me I know every step I know every song I know there's a place where I belong I see all those party lights shining ahead So someone invite me before I drop dead Before she drops dead So oh, oh, give me a chance 'Cause when I start to dance I'm a movie star Something inside of me makes me move When I hear that groove My ma tells me no But my feet tell me "go

Every sound's like a symphony. And I promise, Baltimore. That someday when I take to the floor. The world's gonna wake up and see. Gonna wake up and see. Baltimore and me. Yes, more or less, we all agree Baltimore and me. Someday the world is gonna see. Baltimore and me
mount Everest is the most famous, but not the highest...
geographical point on this earth.

um, excuse me, Miss Whimsy?
I can't see the board again.
Tracy Turnblad.
if I have to write you up...

you will be removed to detention.
miss Wimsey, what am I supposed to do?
hair can't just hang there like a dead thing on your cheeks.
I mean, well... Uh... you know what I mean.
I... Ahh.
as I said, it is not Mount Everest.
now, next week we will be talking...
about earthquakes and volcanoes.
and as exciting as that might sound...
we have to look back approximately 60 million years.

we are going to start with the Ring of Fire.
I want you to contemplate what causes...
the separation of the two components.

You better come on down. And meet the nicest kids in town. Nice white kids who like to lead the way. And once a month we have our Negro Day. And I'm the man who keeps it spinnin' round Mr. Corny Collins with the latest greatest. Baltimore sound So, every afternoon drop everything. Who needs to read and write.

they must think my ears are garbage cans.
would you turn that racket down?
I'm tryin' to iron here.

Edna?
I'm in here, Prudy.
what's that racket?
Ohh, Tracy.
Edna, is my laundry ready?
Yep.
that'll be $3. 00, hon.
that's pretty pricey for a pair of petty pants.
well, I'm sorry, Prudy...
but some-a your personal stains...
required poundin' with a rock.
I'm sure I don't know what you mean.
you're letting her listen to that race music again?
my daughter spends every afternoon at the Stamp and Coin Club.

without that show I have nothing! - Having nothing builds character!
Toodle-oo, Edna!

and, once again, that's the Stricken Chicken.
we will be right back for some more of that hot Detroit sound.
and we're off!
corny.
detroit sound"?
what's that, the cries of people being mugged?
Aw, Velma, the kids dig the rhythm and blues.
Yeah, they're kids, Corny.
that's why we have to steer them in the white direction.
right direction?
didn't I say that?
I'll do it.
you try that again and there'll be stumps where your feet should be.

Oh! Shiny.
Tammy, Lou Ann, you're gonna die.
speaking of cameras, did you have a nice nap?
if you'd do your job, my daughter wouldn't have to fight to be visible.
I gotta show some of the other kids once in a while.
you know, this is a small city.
there aren't that many stations.
this time next year you could be wearing...
an ill-fitting tux, snapping bar mitzvah photos.
I don't know.
it takes two, baby...
show Link.
this is nuts. She can't even dance.
plastic little spastic.
Oh, Link. I can dance so much better than her.
why don't you notice me at school?
Hey, that was our very own Link Larkin singin' It Takes Two.
and I'm Motormouth Maybelle remindin'...
the last Tuesday of this month's your rhythm and blues day.
that's right! Negro Day will be comin' your way.
so don't... uh... uh... Over here.

...very own fun-lovin'...
come on up here, Brenda.
what?
Brenda will be taking a leave of absence from the show.
how long you gonna be gone, Brenda?
just nine months.
seems like we'll have an opening here on the show for a girl...
just as fun-lovin' but maybe not quite as freewheelin'.
wanna be one-a the nicest kids in town?
cut school tomorrow and come down to station WYZT to audition.
no. - But, Ma.
don't test me, Tracy Turnblad.
my diet pill's wearin' off.
but come on.
no one is auditioning for anything in this household.
but why not? Why not?!
because dancing is not your future.
one day you're gonna own Edna's Occidental Laundry.
I don't wanna be a laundress.
I wanna be famous!
look, if you wanna be famous...
learn how to take blood outta car upholstery.
that's a skill you can take right to the bank.
Hey, hey. What's all this ruckus in here? - Not a word.
daddy, tomorrow I'm auditioning to dance on a TV show.
no, she is not. - You are?
first the hair, now this?
but all the kids are battin' up their hair now, hon.
you're no help.
it's "ratting," Daddy.
and our first lady, Jacqueline Kennedy, does it.
I don't believe that.
what do you mean, you don't believe that?!
I don't. - How else would it look that way?
I believe that it is naturally stiff.
she doesn't understand anything.
dancing on that show is my dream. - I know.
just because she wouldn't know a dream if it bit her on the nose.
well, I have information for you, missy.
I once had a dream that I owned a coin-operated laundromat...
and I came down from that cloud real quickly, I'll tell you that.
No!
Oh, Wilbur. - Fine! I'm going to my room!
she thinks I'm bein' mean but I'm not. Those TV people...
they don't pick people like Tracy, or girls like us.
they're gonna hurt her, Wilbur.
I'll talk to her.
OK. Talk to her.
I'll talk to her.
don't you worry.
OK.
what?
Tracy, this TV thing.
you really want it?
with all my heart.
then you go for it!
this is America, babe.
you gotta think big to be big.
big ain't the problem in this family, Wilbur.
you follow your dream.
mine came true, and now I have the most precious thing in the world.
the Taj Mahal of joke shops.
back step, cha-cha-cha.
side step, front step.
back and turn.
front step, cha-cha-cha.
Tammy, sharper.
side step, front step.
back, again.
Oh, my God, Penny, there's Link.
link!
penny, pinch me!
you told me to.
I can't believe I'm really here auditioning.
side step, front step.
I can't believe I'm really here watching you audition.
front step, cha-cha-cha.
back step, cha-cha-cha.
side step, front step.
back and t... oh, Amber. Look at this motley crew.
Oh! This town sure has gone downhill...
since I was crowned Miss Baltimore Crabs.
Oh, my God, how times have changed. These girls must be blind or completely deranged. But time seemed to halt. When I was Miss Baltimore Crabs
amber, that move is far too dirty.
mother, wake up from that dream of yours.
this isn't 1930. - Ha ha ha.
you can laugh but life's a test. Don't do this, don't do that Remember, Mother knows best. For the crown's in the vault. From when I won Miss Baltimore Crabs. These steps are perfect ammunition. Let me show you how your mommy dear took out the competition
girls, go get 'em.
boys, let's rumba.
those poor runner-ups might still hold some grudges. They padded their cups but I screwed the judges. Those broads thought they'd win if a plate. They would spin in their dance. Not a chance boys, put me down
Oh, good morning, ladies.
let's see what you got.
twist, twist, twist, twist mashed potato, mambo. Ready, begin. On my show you'll never find. A thrusting hip or bump and grind What's that? A dance for fleas and ticks?
Oh, you should-a seen my bag of tricks. Oh, I hit the stage batons ablaze. But that triple somersault. Is how I clinched Miss Baltimore Crabs
proceed.
are you scared we're on live?
no, I'm sure I can cope. Well, this show isn't broadcast in Cinemascope. I never drank one chocolate malt. No desserts for Miss Baltimore Crabs. This one will never get a date. In those hand-me-down clothes. Ha! Kid, she'll never get a date till Daddy buys her a new nose. I would say "Oy, gevalt
if I wasn't Miss Baltimore Crabs. Do you dance like you dress?
amber, there's no need to be cruel. Would you swim in an integrated pool?
I sure would.
I'm all for integration.
it's the new frontier!
not in Baltimore, it isn't.
and may I be frank?
first impressions can be tough. And when I saw you, I knew it If your size weren't enough. Your last answer just blew it. And so, my dear, so short and stout. You'll never be in. So we're kicking you out. With your form and your face. Aw, well, it isn't your fault. You're just down with a case. Of Miss Baltimore Crabs
uh, you may go.
um... Thank you?
I think they secretly liked you.
cutting my class, Tracy Turnblad?
I trust it was something really important.
it should've been.
what you lookin' at?
nothing. Not you.
can I help you?
that move's swish.
ya got that right.
the man can dine me on a diet of detention...
so long as he don't starve me of my tunes, baby.
does that dance have a name? - Oh, this?
call it the "Peyton Place After Midnight.
I use it to attract, uh, the opposite sex.
that is so groovy.
you're really good.
why, thank you.
so would it be kinda like this?
you can't do that dance.
not bad for a white chick.
Hey, I know where I've seen you before. - Where?
on Corny's show on Negro Day.
Negro Day's the best.
I wish every day were Negro Day.
at our house, it is.

Oh, Wilbur, to think that I almost stopped her...
from reaching for the stars.
and now here she is on local daytime TV.
she's gonna be a regular.
imagine, my little girl, regular at last.
I also hope to be the first woman president or a Rockette.
and if you were president, Tracy...
what would your first official act be?
hmm.
I'd make every day Negro Day.
I read you like tomorrow's headlines, Tracy.
what do you think, kids?
you think we might have a hot new candidate...
for Miss Teenage Hairspray?
that's only the dream of my life.
but Miss Hairspray is mine.
uh, we're on the air.
and your dream will be comin' to you, sweetheart...
saturday, June 2nd, right here on WYZT.
you have to vote for a person, Corny, not one of the Himalayas.
Hi, Penny.
always the charmer, Amber.
I want that chubby communist girl off the show.
well, let me be the first to toss the harpoon.
she's a corrupting influence!
I agree. We don't want our dancers thrusting like savages!
Hey, speak for yourself.
don't get flip with me.
I'm not.
look, now I got some new ideas for the show.
first, we get rid-a Negro Day.
finally, some sense outta you.
and we mix those kids in with the rest-a the Council.
mix those kids?
that's right, I said it.
this is not a black-and-tan cocktail!
well, why couldn't it be?
Velma, isn't this where it's all headin' anyway?
now, you can fight it or you can rock out to it.
maybe it is time for some fresh ideas...
like... like a nice, fresh new host!
Heh.
gee, Velma, how do you fire Corny Collins...
from The Corny Collins Show?
they do it all the time on Lassie!
Velma, you've let this go too far!
me?

that big little girl is sending my sales through the roof.
more people are breathing aerosol than oxygen!
do you think you could show us some of those new dance moves?
Yeah, sure.
Ooh, pretty flowers.

Hey, look, she's wearin' his ring. I can't stop cryin' and so in my own tears. I'm gonna drown. 'Cause he wants to rendezvous. With the new girl. We're kinda sad and blue. Yes, it's true, girl. We'd like to say. To the new girl in town. The new girl in town

well, why not?
who's goin' to look out for me...
better than my mom?
Me？an agent?

and out-negotiating them.
Oh, you're crazy.
Oh, Tracy, I haven't left this house in... in years.
then isn't it time you did?
Oh, no, Tracy.
we'll have your father meet with him.

I swear, I don't know what goes on down there.
Mrs. Turnblad.
I'd know whose mother you were anywhere.
Really?
Hello, Amber.
Hello, Tracy.
ma, this is Amber and Mrs. Von Tussle.
Mrs. Von Tussle is the station's manager.
Oh, the station manager.
Oh! Oh, it was so nice-a you let her on that show.

that's for sure.
let me guess...
brand-new dress?
Oh, yes.
well, you'll stop traffic.
it was nice meeting you. Tracy.
Bye, Tracy.
ma, don't listen to a word she says!
I'm takin' this back.
don't you dare.
I am. - Don't you dare.
don't you know why she hates us?
she's afraid I'll beat Amber for Miss Teenage Hairspray.
Really?
they can't put Tracy in special ed.
I won't have it.
I mean, even if I have to tutor her myself...
they cannot hold my friend back.
you're a saint. - Mm.
Oh, and it's totally not true about her and the entire football team.
I mean, please.
anybody can get grass stains all over their back.
amber, stop it.
I'm sick-a you doin' that.
just because she's a good dancer.
uh! I'm sorry.
you think that she can dance?
well, maybe you'd rather have her as your partner.
you could get sponsored by Goodyear.
excuse me. What is going on back there?
Tracy, that's horrible.
Mr. Flak does not have breasts.
what? No. I would... I would never.
what... Oh.
Oh, and Mr. Larkin, perhaps you'd like to share...
with the rest of the class Patrick Henry's immortal last words.
kiss my ass"?
you didn't have to do that, Link.
Hey, no prob.
besides, looks like a cool scene down here.
right.
Hey, cool.
Hey, Tracy!
not quite, huh?
Ah, damn. Just when I was gettin' it.
listen, man, you ain't gotta stop now.
my mom's havin' a platter party tonight.
y'all wanna come check it out?
now?!
would you mind if I, too, checked it out?
I've never been to North Avenue before.
uh, well, would it be safe?
you know, for us?
calm down, cracker boy.
it's cool.
Wow.
being invited places by colored people!
it feels so hip!
I'm glad y'all feel that way 'cause, uh, not many people do.
y'all know what I'm sayin'? - Yeah, that's right.
Hey!
I can't see why people look at me. And only see the color of my face. Ah, yeah, then there's those that try to help, God knows. But always have to put me in my place. But I won't ask you to be color-blind. 'Cause if you pick the fruit then, girl, you're sure to find. The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice. I could say it ain't so but, darlin', what's the use?
the darker the chocolate, the richer the taste. And that's where it's at. Now, baby, run and tell that. Now run and tell that. Run and tell that. Run and tell that. I can't see why people disagree. Each time I tell 'em what I know is true, oh, no. And if you come. And see the world I'm from. I bet your heart is gonna feel it, too, yeah. I could lie but, baby, let's be bold. Vanilla can be nice. But if the truth be told. Blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice. I could say it ain't so but, darlin', what's the use?
the darker the chocolate, the richer the taste. And that's where it's at Oh, baby, baby, run and tell that. Run and tell that. Go run and tell that. Run and tell that. Come on and run and tell that. Run and tell that. Hey, run and tell. Go tell Run and tell that
link!
link Larkin!
come here, girl.
this is my sister, Little Inez.
Oh, I know Tracy Turnblad.
good for you, girl. You got on the show.
well, you better be next. - Ya got that right.
Oh, you know she is. You better show 'em, girl.
I'm tired of coverin' up all my pride. So give me five on the black hand side. I got a new way of movin' and I got my own voice. So how can I help but to shout and rejoice. Oh, the people 'round here can barely pay their rent. They try to make a dollar outta fifteen cent. But we got a spirit money just can't buy. It's deep as a river and soars to the sky, to the sky!
Hey, I can't see the reason it can't be. The kinda world where we all get our chance. The time is now. So we can show 'em how just turn the music up. And let's all dance, yeah, yeah 'Cause all things are equal when it comes to love. Well, that ain't quite true 'cause when push comes to shove. The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice. They say it ain't so but, darlin', what's the use?
the darker the chocolate, the richer the taste. And that's where it's at. Now, baby, baby, baby, run and tell that. Run and tell that. Run and tell that. Ah yeah, baby. Run and tell that. Go run and tell that. G-g-g-g-go home and run and tell that - Go, baby! - Whoo!
it was horrible.
mom, he just danced on that bus...
with that great white whale and those negroes.
no, honey.
reeling him back in is the easiest thing in the world.
remember, I control his career.
now, don't worry.
mommy will take care of everything.
are you all hungry for some good fun?
bring on that pecan pie. Pour some sugar on it, sugar, don't be shy. Scoop me up a mess of that chocolate swirl. Don't be stingy, I'm a growin' girl. I offer big love with no apology. How can I deny the world the most of me?
I am not afraid to throw my weight around. Pound by pound by pound. Because I'm big, blonde and beautiful. Face the fact, it's simply irrefutable. No one wants a meal that only offers the least. When, girl, we're servin' up the whole damn feast
well, looks like y'all took a step outta bounds.
now, who we got here?
mom, I want you to meet my new friends.
this here is Link. Tracy Turnblad.
this is just so afro-tastic!
and this young lady right here...
is Penny Pingleton.
I'm very pleased and scared to be here.
Oh, now, honey. We got more reason to be scared on your street.
Latoya, put that record down.
you gonna scratch it.
can't you keep your little girl...
shall we dance?
come on.
my name is Mike.
Mike?
Yes, Mike.
Mike who?
it's Mike.
anyway, ahem...
I'm calling because I have some information...
about your daughter's whereabouts.
what? - Right now, as we speak...
your daughter has entered a hotbed of moral...
turpentine.
baby don't sleep. Baby don't eat. Baby just like another boink-boink
link, aren't you gonna get in awful trouble for this?
I'm not plannin' on tellin' my dad.
no, I mean in trouble with someone else.
hmm. Maybe.
maybe it's worth it.
I think knowin' you's the start of a pretty big adventure.
Tracy Edna Turnblad!
Ooh, we get any more white people in here...
this gonna be a suburb.
do you know what I had to pay a cab...
just to consider comin' down here?
Oh, uh, Mom...
no call. You just disappear.
and all mashed up against a crooner?
um, Edna Turnblad, this is Link.
come on, we're goin'.
and, Penny, go home before your mother shoots you.
miss Edna, is it?
Hi, I mean, you don't have to rush off, you know.
well, I do. I left my iron on.
Oh, your iron.
well, before you go...
you sure you wouldn't like to have...
a little somethin' to eat?
is that braised?
slice me off a piece of that hogshead cheese. And take a look inside. My book of recipes. Now, don't-cha sniff around for somethin' fluffy and light. We need a man who brings a man-size appetite. We'll use a pinch-a sugar and a dash-a spice. I'll let you lick the spoon because it tastes so nice. We keep it in the oven till it's good and hot. Keep on stirrin' till it hits the spot. Because I'm big, blonde and beautiful. There is nothin' 'bout us that's unsuitable. Why sit in the bleachers timid and afraid. When, Edna, you look like the whole parade?
they say that white has might and thin is in. Well, that's just bull 'Cause, ladies, big is back. And as for black, it's beautiful. All shapes and sizes follow me. Who wants a twig when you can climb a whole tree. Woke up today. Feeling the way. I always do Hungry for something that I can't eat. Then I hear that beat. That rhythm of town starts calling me down. It's like a message from high above. Pulling me out to the smiles and the streets that I love - Good morning, Baltimore! - Good morning, Baltimore. Every day's like an open door. Every night is a fantasy. Every sound's like a symphony. Good morning, Baltimore. And someday when I take to the floor. The world's gonna wake up and see. Baltimore and me. Look at my hair. What 'do can compare with mine today?
I've got my hairspray and radio. I'm ready to go. The rats on the street. All dance around my feet. They seem to say: "Tracy, it's up to you
so oh, oh, don't hold me back 'Cause today all my dreams will come true Good morning, Baltimore There's the flasher who lives next door There's the bum on his barroom stool They wish me luck on my way to school Good morning, Baltimore And someday when I take to the floor The world's gonna wake up and see Baltimore and me I know every step I know every song I know there's a place where I belong I see all those party lights shining ahead So someone invite me before I drop dead Before she drops dead So oh, oh, give me a chance 'Cause when I start to dance I'm a movie star Something inside of me makes me move When I hear that groove My ma tells me no But my feet tell me "go
it's like a drummer inside my heart. So, oh, oh, don't make me wait. One more moment for my life to start. I love you, Baltimore. Every day's like an open door. Every night is a fantasy. Every sound's like a symphony. And I promise, Baltimore. That someday when I take to the floor. The world's gonna wake up and see. Gonna wake up and see. Baltimore and me. Yes, more or less, we all agree Baltimore and me. Someday the world is gonna see. Baltimore and me
mount Everest is the most famous, but not the highest...
geographical point on this earth.
now, who can tell me what that is?
um, excuse me, Miss Whimsy?
I can't see the board again.
Tracy Turnblad.
if I have to write you up...
for inappropriate hair height one more time...
you will be removed to detention.
miss Wimsey, what am I supposed to do?
hair can't just hang there like a dead thing on your cheeks.
I mean, well... Uh... you know what I mean.
I... Ahh.
as I said, it is not Mount Everest.
now, next week we will be talking...
about earthquakes and volcanoes.
and as exciting as that might sound...
we have to look back approximately 60 million years.
now, if you turn your pages...
we are going to start with the Ring of Fire.
I want you to contemplate what causes...
the separation of the two components.

And then they shake it, shake it, shake it. Like they're losin' their mind. You'll never see them frown. 'Cause they're the nicest kids in town. Oh, every afternoon you turn your TV on, huh. Yeah, we know you turn the sound up. When your parents are gone, yeah. Then you twist and shout for your favorite star. And when you've practiced every step. That's in your repertoire. You better come on down. And meet the nicest kids in town. Nice white kids who like to lead the way. And once a month we have our Negro Day. And I'm the man who keeps it spinnin' round Mr. Corny Collins with the latest greatest. Baltimore sound So, every afternoon drop everything. Who needs to read and write.

they must think my ears are garbage cans.
would you turn that racket down?
I'm tryin' to iron here.
nicest kids in. Kids in town, whoo!

Edna?
I'm in here, Prudy.
what's that racket?
Ohh, Tracy.
Edna, is my laundry ready?
Yep.
that'll be $3. 00, hon.
that's pretty pricey for a pair of petty pants.
well, I'm sorry, Prudy...
but some-a your personal stains...
required poundin' with a rock.
I'm sure I don't know what you mean.
you're letting her listen to that race music again?

and we're off!

what's that, the cries of people being mugged?
Aw, Velma, the kids dig the rhythm and blues.
Yeah, they're kids, Corny.
that's why we have to steer them in the white direction.
right direction?
didn't I say that?
I'll do it.
you try that again and there'll be stumps where your feet should be.

if you'd do your job, my daughter wouldn't have to fight to be visible.
I gotta show some of the other kids once in a while.
you know, this is a small city.
there aren't that many stations.
this time next year you could be wearing...
an ill-fitting tux, snapping bar mitzvah photos.
I don't know.
it takes two, baby...
show Link.
this is nuts. She can't even dance.
plastic little spastic.
Oh, Link. I can dance so much better than her.

Hey, that was our very own Link Larkin singin' It Takes Two.
and I'm Motormouth Maybelle remindin'...
the last Tuesday of this month's your rhythm and blues day.
that's right! Negro Day will be comin' your way.
so don't... uh... uh... Over here.
thank you.
so, catch all the croonin' when y'all set and tune in.
thank you, Motormouth. And now it's time to...
owner's coming. He'll call my mother again, let's go.
...very own fun-lovin'...
come on up here, Brenda.
what?
Brenda will be taking a leave of absence from the show.
how long you gonna be gone, Brenda?
just nine months.
seems like we'll have an opening here on the show for a girl...
just as fun-lovin' but maybe not quite as freewheelin'.
wanna be one-a the nicest kids in town?
cut school tomorrow and come down to station WYZT to audition.
no. - But, Ma.
don't test me, Tracy Turnblad.
my diet pill's wearin' off.
but come on.
no one is auditioning for anything in this household.
but why not? Why not?!
because dancing is not your future.
one day you're gonna own Edna's Occidental Laundry.
I don't wanna be a laundress.
I wanna be famous!
look, if you wanna be famous...
learn how to take blood outta car upholstery.
that's a skill you can take right to the bank.
Hey, hey. What's all this ruckus in here? - Not a word.
daddy, tomorrow I'm auditioning to dance on a TV show.
no, she is not. - You are?
first the hair, now this?
but all the kids are battin' up their hair now, hon.
you're no help.
it's "ratting," Daddy.
and our first lady, Jacqueline Kennedy, does it.
I don't believe that.
what do you mean, you don't believe that?!
I don't. - How else would it look that way?
I believe that it is naturally stiff.
she doesn't understand anything.
dancing on that show is my dream. - I know.
just because she wouldn't know a dream if it bit her on the nose.
well, I have information for you, missy.
I once had a dream that I owned a coin-operated laundromat...
and I came down from that cloud real quickly, I'll tell you that.
No!
Oh, Wilbur. - Fine! I'm going to my room!
she thinks I'm bein' mean but I'm not. Those TV people...
they don't pick people like Tracy, or girls like us.
they're gonna hurt her, Wilbur.
I'll talk to her.
OK. Talk to her.
I'll talk to her.
don't you worry.
OK.
what?
Tracy, this TV thing.
you really want it?
with all my heart.
then you go for it!
this is America, babe.
you gotta think big to be big.
big ain't the problem in this family, Wilbur.
you follow your dream.
mine came true, and now I have the most precious thing in the world.
the Taj Mahal of joke shops.
back step, cha-cha-cha.
side step, front step.
back and turn.
front step, cha-cha-cha.
Tammy, sharper.
side step, front step.
back, again.
Oh, my God, Penny, there's Link.
link!
penny, pinch me!
you told me to.
I can't believe I'm really here auditioning.
side step, front step.
I can't believe I'm really here watching you audition.
front step, cha-cha-cha.
back step, cha-cha-cha.
side step, front step.
back and t... oh, Amber. Look at this motley crew.
Oh! This town sure has gone downhill...
since I was crowned Miss Baltimore Crabs.
Oh, my God, how times have changed. These girls must be blind or completely deranged. But time seemed to halt. When I was Miss Baltimore Crabs
amber, that move is far too dirty.
mother, wake up from that dream of yours.
this isn't 1930. - Ha ha ha.
you can laugh but life's a test. Don't do this, don't do that Remember, Mother knows best. For the crown's in the vault. From when I won Miss Baltimore Crabs. These steps are perfect ammunition. Let me show you how your mommy dear took out the competition
girls, go get 'em.
boys, let's rumba.
those poor runner-ups might still hold some grudges. They padded their cups but I screwed the judges. Those broads thought they'd win if a plate. They would spin in their dance. Not a chance boys, put me down
Oh, good morning, ladies.
let's see what you got.
twist, twist, twist, twist mashed potato, mambo. Ready, begin. On my show you'll never find. A thrusting hip or bump and grind What's that? A dance for fleas and ticks?
Oh, you should-a seen my bag of tricks. Oh, I hit the stage batons ablaze. But that triple somersault. Is how I clinched Miss Baltimore Crabs
proceed.
are you scared we're on live?
no, I'm sure I can cope. Well, this show isn't broadcast in Cinemascope. I never drank one chocolate malt. No desserts for Miss Baltimore Crabs. This one will never get a date. In those hand-me-down clothes. Ha! Kid, she'll never get a date till Daddy buys her a new nose. I would say "Oy, gevalt
if I wasn't Miss Baltimore Crabs. Do you dance like you dress?
amber, there's no need to be cruel. Would you swim in an integrated pool?
I sure would.
I'm all for integration.
it's the new frontier!
not in Baltimore, it isn't.
and may I be frank?
first impressions can be tough. And when I saw you, I knew it If your size weren't enough. Your last answer just blew it. And so, my dear, so short and stout. You'll never be in. So we're kicking you out. With your form and your face. Aw, well, it isn't your fault. You're just down with a case. Of Miss Baltimore Crabs
uh, you may go.
um... Thank you?
I think they secretly liked you.
cutting my class, Tracy Turnblad?
I trust it was something really important.
it should've been.
what you lookin' at?
nothing. Not you.
can I help you?
that move's swish.
ya got that right.
the man can dine me on a diet of detention...
so long as he don't starve me of my tunes, baby.
does that dance have a name? - Oh, this?
call it the "Peyton Place After Midnight.
I use it to attract, uh, the opposite sex.
that is so groovy.
you're really good.
why, thank you.
so would it be kinda like this?
you can't do that dance.
not bad for a white chick.
Hey, I know where I've seen you before. - Where?
on Corny's show on Negro Day.
Negro Day's the best.
I wish every day were Negro Day.
at our house, it is.
Hey. Show me another one?

Bye, Tracy.
ma, don't listen to a word she says!
I'm takin' this back.
don't you dare.
I am. - Don't you dare.
don't you know why she hates us?
she's afraid I'll beat Amber for Miss Teenage Hairspray.
Really?
they can't put Tracy in special ed.
I won't have it.
I mean, even if I have to tutor her myself...
they cannot hold my friend back.
you're a saint. - Mm.
Oh, and it's totally not true about her and the entire football team.
I mean, please.
anybody can get grass stains all over their back.
amber, stop it.
I'm sick-a you doin' that.
just because she's a good dancer.
uh! I'm sorry.
you think that she can dance?
well, maybe you'd rather have her as your partner.
you could get sponsored by Goodyear.
excuse me. What is going on back there?
Tracy, that's horrible.
Mr. Flak does not have breasts.
what? No. I would... I would never.
what... Oh.
Oh, and Mr. Larkin, perhaps you'd like to share...
with the rest of the class Patrick Henry's immortal last words.
kiss my ass"?
you didn't have to do that, Link.
Hey, no prob.
besides, looks like a cool scene down here.
right.
Hey, cool.
Hey, Tracy!
not quite, huh?
Ah, damn. Just when I was gettin' it.
listen, man, you ain't gotta stop now.
my mom's havin' a platter party tonight.
y'all wanna come check it out?
now?!
would you mind if I, too, checked it out?
I've never been to North Avenue before.
uh, well, would it be safe?
you know, for us?
calm down, cracker boy.
it's cool.
Wow.
being invited places by colored people!
it feels so hip!
I'm glad y'all feel that way 'cause, uh, not many people do.
y'all know what I'm sayin'? - Yeah, that's right.
Hey!
I can't see why people look at me. And only see the color of my face. Ah, yeah, then there's those that try to help, God knows. But always have to put me in my place. But I won't ask you to be color-blind. 'Cause if you pick the fruit then, girl, you're sure to find. The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice. I could say it ain't so but, darlin', what's the use?
the darker the chocolate, the richer the taste. And that's where it's at. Now, baby, run and tell that. Now run and tell that. Run and tell that. Run and tell that. I can't see why people disagree. Each time I tell 'em what I know is true, oh, no. And if you come. And see the world I'm from. I bet your heart is gonna feel it, too, yeah. I could lie but, baby, let's be bold. Vanilla can be nice. But if the truth be told. Blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice. I could say it ain't so but, darlin', what's the use?
the darker the chocolate, the richer the taste. And that's where it's at Oh, baby, baby, run and tell that. Run and tell that. Go run and tell that. Run and tell that. Come on and run and tell that. Run and tell that. Hey, run and tell. Go tell Run and tell that
link!
link Larkin!
come here, girl.
this is my sister, Little Inez.
Oh, I know Tracy Turnblad.
good for you, girl. You got on the show.
well, you better be next. - Ya got that right.
Oh, you know she is. You better show 'em, girl.
I'm tired of coverin' up all my pride. So give me five on the black hand side. I got a new way of movin' and I got my own voice. So how can I help but to shout and rejoice. Oh, the people 'round here can barely pay their rent. They try to make a dollar outta fifteen cent. But we got a spirit money just can't buy. It's deep as a river and soars to the sky, to the sky!
Hey, I can't see the reason it can't be. The kinda world where we all get our chance. The time is now. So we can show 'em how just turn the music up. And let's all dance, yeah, yeah 'Cause all things are equal when it comes to love. Well, that ain't quite true 'cause when push comes to shove. The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice. They say it ain't so but, darlin', what's the use?
the darker the chocolate, the richer the taste. And that's where it's at. Now, baby, baby, baby, run and tell that. Run and tell that. Run and tell that. Ah yeah, baby. Run and tell that. Go run and tell that. G-g-g-g-go home and run and tell that - Go, baby! - Whoo!
it was horrible.
mom, he just danced on that bus...
with that great white whale and those negroes.
no, honey.
reeling him back in is the easiest thing in the world.
remember, I control his career.
now, don't worry.
mommy will take care of everything.
are you all hungry for some good fun?
bring on that pecan pie. Pour some sugar on it, sugar, don't be shy. Scoop me up a mess of that chocolate swirl. Don't be stingy, I'm a growin' girl. I offer big love with no apology. How can I deny the world the most of me?
I am not afraid to throw my weight around. Pound by pound by pound. Because I'm big, blonde and beautiful. Face the fact, it's simply irrefutable. No one wants a meal that only offers the least. When, girl, we're servin' up the whole damn feast
well, looks like y'all took a step outta bounds.
now, who we got here?
mom, I want you to meet my new friends.
this here is Link. Tracy Turnblad.
this is just so afro-tastic!
and this young lady right here...
is Penny Pingleton.
I'm very pleased and scared to be here.
Oh, now, honey. We got more reason to be scared on your street.
Latoya, put that record down.
you gonna scratch it.
can't you keep your little girl...
shall we dance?
come on.
my name is Mike.
Mike?
Yes, Mike.
Mike who?
it's Mike.
anyway, ahem...
I'm calling because I have some information...
about your daughter's whereabouts.
what? - Right now, as we speak...
your daughter has entered a hotbed of moral...
turpentine.
baby don't sleep. Baby don't eat. Baby just like another boink-boink
link, aren't you gonna get in awful trouble for this?
I'm not plannin' on tellin' my dad.
no, I mean in trouble with someone else.
hmm. Maybe.
maybe it's worth it.
I think knowin' you's the start of a pretty big adventure.
Tracy Edna Turnblad!
Ooh, we get any more white people in here...
this gonna be a suburb.
do you know what I had to pay a cab...
just to consider comin' down here?
Oh, uh, Mom...
no call. You just disappear.
and all mashed up against a crooner?
um, Edna Turnblad, this is Link.
come on, we're goin'.
and, Penny, go home before your mother shoots you.
miss Edna, is it?
Hi, I mean, you don't have to rush off, you know.
well, I do. I left my iron on.
Oh, your iron.
well, before you go...
you sure you wouldn't like to have...
a little somethin' to eat?
is that braised?
slice me off a piece of that hogshead cheese. And take a look inside. My book of recipes. Now, don't-cha sniff around for somethin' fluffy and light. We need a man who brings a man-size appetite. We'll use a pinch-a sugar and a dash-a spice. I'll let you lick the spoon because it tastes so nice. We keep it in the oven till it's good and hot. Keep on stirrin' till it hits the spot. Because I'm big, blonde and beautiful. There is nothin' 'bout us that's unsuitable. Why sit in the bleachers timid and afraid. When, Edna, you look like the whole parade?
they say that white has might and thin is in. Well, that's just bull 'Cause, ladies, big is back. And as for black, it's beautiful. All shapes and sizes follow me. Who wants a twig when you can climb a whole tree. Woke up today. Feeling the way. I always do Hungry for something that I can't eat. Then I hear that beat. That rhythm of town starts calling me down. It's like a message from high above. Pulling me out to the smiles and the streets that I love - Good morning, Baltimore! - Good morning, Baltimore. Every day's like an open door. Every night is a fantasy. Every sound's like a symphony. Good morning, Baltimore. And someday when I take to the floor. The world's gonna wake up and see. Baltimore and me. Look at my hair. What 'do can compare with mine today?
I've got my hairspray and radio. I'm ready to go. The rats on the street. All dance around my feet. They seem to say: "Tracy, it's up to you
so oh, oh, don't hold me back 'Cause today all my dreams will come true Good morning, Baltimore There's the flasher who lives next door There's the bum on his barroom stool They wish me luck on my way to school Good morning, Baltimore And someday when I take to the floor The world's gonna wake up and see Baltimore and me I know every step I know every song I know there's a place where I belong I see all those party lights shining ahead So someone invite me before I drop dead Before she drops dead So oh, oh, give me a chance 'Cause when I start to dance I'm a movie star Something inside of me makes me move When I hear that groove My ma tells me no But my feet tell me "go
it's like a drummer inside my heart. So, oh, oh, don't make me wait. One more moment for my life to start. I love you, Baltimore. Every day's like an open door. Every night is a fantasy. Every sound's like a symphony. And I promise, Baltimore. That someday when I take to the floor. The world's gonna wake up and see. Gonna wake up and see. Baltimore and me. Yes, more or less, we all agree Baltimore and me. Someday the world is gonna see. Baltimore and me
mount Everest is the most famous, but not the highest...
geographical point on this earth.
now, who can tell me what that is?
um, excuse me, Miss Whimsy?
I can't see the board again.
Tracy Turnblad.
if I have to write you up...
for inappropriate hair height one more time...
you will be removed to detention.
miss Wimsey, what am I supposed to do?
hair can't just hang there like a dead thing on your cheeks.
I mean, well... Uh... you know what I mean.
I... Ahh.
as I said, it is not Mount Everest.
now, next week we will be talking...
about earthquakes and volcanoes.
and as exciting as that might sound...
we have to look back approximately 60 million years.
now, if you turn your pages...
we are going to start with the Ring of Fire.
I want you to contemplate what causes...
the separation of the two components.
penny, come on, hurry!
outta my way!
push! We're late.
one minute to air. - OK.
40 to go!
don't change that channel.
coming up next: The Corny Collins Show.
30 seconds.
Hiya, Dad! - Goodbye!
it's my daughter.
10 seconds. Places, everyone.

my mom says I'm not allowed to perspire!
hey there, teenage Baltimore!
don't change that channel 'cause it's time...
for The Corny Collins Show...
brought to you by Ultra Clutch hairspray.
Oh, every afternoon when the clock strikes four. Well, a crazy bunch of kids crash through that door, yeah. Well, they throw off their coats. And leave the squares behind. And then they shake it, shake it, shake it. Like they're losin' their mind. You'll never see them frown. 'Cause they're the nicest kids in town. Oh, every afternoon you turn your TV on, huh. Yeah, we know you turn the sound up. When your parents are gone, yeah. Then you twist and shout for your favorite star. And when you've practiced every step. That's in your repertoire. You better come on down. And meet the nicest kids in town. Nice white kids who like to lead the way. And once a month we have our Negro Day. And I'm the man who keeps it spinnin' round Mr. Corny Collins with the latest greatest. Baltimore sound So, every afternoon drop everything. Who needs to read and write. When you can dance and sing, yeah!
forget about your algebra and calculus. You can always do your homework on the mornin' bus. Can't tell a verb from a noun. They're the nicest kids in town
R... r... r... role call!

so, if every night you're shakin'
as you lie in bed. Shake it, baby. And the bass and drums are poundin' in your head. Who cares about sleep when you can snooze in school. You'll never get to college but you'll sure look cool. Don't need a cap or a gown. When you're the nicest kids in town
they must think my ears are garbage cans.
would you turn that racket down?
I'm tryin' to iron here.
nicest kids in. Kids in town, whoo!
ma, it's not racket. It's The Corny Collins Show.
well, it's turning your brains into mud.
Mrs. Turnblad, it's a new dance!
the Stricken Chicken.
well, I can't hear myself think.
how am I supposed to negotiate pleats?
Edna?
I'm in here, Prudy.
what's that racket?
Ohh, Tracy.
Edna, is my laundry ready?
Yep.
that'll be $3. 00, hon.
that's pretty pricey for a pair of petty pants.
well, I'm sorry, Prudy...
but some-a your personal stains...
required poundin' with a rock.
I'm sure I don't know what you mean.
you're letting her listen to that race music again?
my daughter spends every afternoon at the Stamp and Coin Club.
Oh, really? Well, your daughter hap...
Oh, what is that? The Wavin' Raven?
it's a little twitchy.
Oh, you wanna play Charades now. All right.
OK, go ahead.

penny.

Tracy Turnblad, are you tryin' to tell me...
that... that Penny didn't get permission...
from her mother to be here?
what?
penny.
you are banned from this house.
you will never watch that show again!
without that show I have nothing! - Having nothing builds character!
Toodle-oo, Edna!
give 'em a hand, folks. All right, all right.
and, once again, that's the Stricken Chicken.
we will be right back for some more of that hot Detroit sound.
and we're off!
corny.
detroit sound"?
what's that, the cries of people being mugged?
Aw, Velma, the kids dig the rhythm and blues.
Yeah, they're kids, Corny.
that's why we have to steer them in the white direction.
right direction?
didn't I say that?
I'll do it.
you try that again and there'll be stumps where your feet should be.
you got that? You little whor...
amber.
...holy moly. Baby.
good job dancing today.
it's time. - Ah!
link.
amber.
amber. - Amber, Amber, Amber.
save your personal life for the cameras, sweetie.
Oh! Shiny.
Tammy, Lou Ann, you're gonna die.
speaking of cameras, did you have a nice nap?
if you'd do your job, my daughter wouldn't have to fight to be visible.
I gotta show some of the other kids once in a while.
you know, this is a small city.
there aren't that many stations.
this time next year you could be wearing...
an ill-fitting tux, snapping bar mitzvah photos.
I don't know.
it takes two, baby...
show Link.
this is nuts. She can't even dance.
plastic little spastic.
Oh, Link. I can dance so much better than her.
why don't you notice me at school?
Hey, that was our very own Link Larkin singin' It Takes Two.
and I'm Motormouth Maybelle remindin'...
the last Tuesday of this month's your rhythm and blues day.
that's right! Negro Day will be comin' your way.
so don't... uh... uh... Over here.
thank you.
so, catch all the croonin' when y'all set and tune in.
thank you, Motormouth. And now it's time to...
owner's coming. He'll call my mother again, let's go.
...very own fun-lovin'...
come on up here, Brenda.
what?
Brenda will be taking a leave of absence from the show.
how long you gonna be gone, Brenda?
just nine months.
seems like we'll have an opening here on the show for a girl...
just as fun-lovin' but maybe not quite as freewheelin'.
wanna be one-a the nicest kids in town?
cut school tomorrow and come down to station WYZT to audition.
no. - But, Ma.
don't test me, Tracy Turnblad.
my diet pill's wearin' off.
but come on.
no one is auditioning for anything in this household.
but why not? Why not?!
because dancing is not your future.
one day you're gonna own Edna's Occidental Laundry.
I don't wanna be a laundress.
I wanna be famous!
look, if you wanna be famous...
learn how to take blood outta car upholstery.
that's a skill you can take right to the bank.
Hey, hey. What's all this ruckus in here? - Not a word.
daddy, tomorrow I'm auditioning to dance on a TV show.
no, she is not. - You are?
first the hair, now this?
but all the kids are battin' up their hair now, hon.
you're no help.
it's "ratting," Daddy.
and our first lady, Jacqueline Kennedy, does it.
I don't believe that.
what do you mean, you don't believe that?!
I don't. - How else would it look that way?
I believe that it is naturally stiff.
she doesn't understand anything.
dancing on that show is my dream. - I know.
just because she wouldn't know a dream if it bit her on the nose.
well, I have information for you, missy.
I once had a dream that I owned a coin-operated laundromat...
and I came down from that cloud real quickly, I'll tell you that.
No!
Oh, Wilbur. - Fine! I'm going to my room!
she thinks I'm bein' mean but I'm not. Those TV people...
they don't pick people like Tracy, or girls like us.
they're gonna hurt her, Wilbur.
I'll talk to her.
OK. Talk to her.
I'll talk to her.
don't you worry.
OK.
what?
Tracy, this TV thing.
you really want it?
with all my heart.
then you go for it!
this is America, babe.
you gotta think big to be big.
big ain't the problem in this family, Wilbur.
you follow your dream.
mine came true, and now I have the most precious thing in the world.
the Taj Mahal of joke shops.
back step, cha-cha-cha.
side step, front step.
back and turn.
front step, cha-cha-cha.
Tammy, sharper.
side step, front step.
back, again.
Oh, my God, Penny, there's Link.
link!
penny, pinch me!
you told me to.
I can't believe I'm really here auditioning.
side step, front step.
I can't believe I'm really here watching you audition.
front step, cha-cha-cha.
back step, cha-cha-cha.
side step, front step.
back and t... oh, Amber. Look at this motley crew.
Oh! This town sure has gone downhill...
since I was crowned Miss Baltimore Crabs.
Oh, my God, how times have changed. These girls must be blind or completely deranged. But time seemed to halt. When I was Miss Baltimore Crabs
amber, that move is far too dirty.
mother, wake up from that dream of yours.
this isn't 1930. - Ha ha ha.
you can laugh but life's a test. Don't do this, don't do that Remember, Mother knows best. For the crown's in the vault. From when I won Miss Baltimore Crabs. These steps are perfect ammunition. Let me show you how your mommy dear took out the competition
girls, go get 'em.
boys, let's rumba.
those poor runner-ups might still hold some grudges. They padded their cups but I screwed the judges. Those broads thought they'd win if a plate. They would spin in their dance. Not a chance boys, put me down
Oh, good morning, ladies.
let's see what you got.
twist, twist, twist, twist mashed potato, mambo. Ready, begin. On my show you'll never find. A thrusting hip or bump and grind What's that? A dance for fleas and ticks?
Oh, you should-a seen my bag of tricks. Oh, I hit the stage batons ablaze. But that triple somersault. Is how I clinched Miss Baltimore Crabs
proceed.
are you scared we're on live?
no, I'm sure I can cope. Well, this show isn't broadcast in Cinemascope. I never drank one chocolate malt. No desserts for Miss Baltimore Crabs. This one will never get a date. In those hand-me-down clothes. Ha! Kid, she'll never get a date till Daddy buys her a new nose. I would say "Oy, gevalt
if I wasn't Miss Baltimore Crabs. Do you dance like you dress?
amber, there's no need to be cruel. Would you swim in an integrated pool?
I sure would.
