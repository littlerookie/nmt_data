we want some answers, and we want them now.

we not responsible. Please.
shut up! - Please!
this isn't gonna work.
we only make food.
we not responsible. Please. Only food.

yeah? Well, we'll see about that, won't we?
please. Please.
we only make food.
only food. Please!
Oh, God! Come on!
we got to do something here.
I agree, but this isn't it.
well, what, then? - I don't know.
but not this. Okay, Joe's right.
please. Please.
please. Please.
please. Please sit.
please. Please sit.
we, uh... We bring food. Please.
is anybody gonna eat that?
how do you feel?
it's the best damn chinese food I ever had.
I could eat it every day.
you hang in there, Janet.
we're gonna get you back.
what if they took her? What if my daughter is in a place like this?
don't think like that.
you don't understand.
I hope they took her.
then at least I'd know she'd be safe.
thank you.
you're supposed to let fate decide.
your wife is waiting for you.
that's what mine says.
let me see that.
is anybody else here - "your judgment is a little off at this point.
you will soon win some high prize or award.
by helping someone else, you also help yourself.
mine's in chinese.
mine's just numbers.
that's weird.
Janet? - What?
what does yours say?
it just said, uh,"may the road rise to meet you.
an Irish fortune cookie?
are any other men here married? - Come on. She spun that thing.
you can't think that's specifically meant for you.
it's a fortune, Charlie.
don't kill yourself over it.
did you enjoy your meal?
who the hell are you? - I'm the night manager.
what are you doing here?- I- I manage the hotel.
at night.
is that gun loaded?
how long have you worked here? - I started last night.
then you would have seen who brought us here.
beg your pardon, ma'am, But you were already checked in when I started.
here.
yesterday's register.
it says we checked in at 6: 00 P. M.
that's right, ma'am.
excuse me, sir.
may I see your knife for a moment?
great.
here.
now, listen. We've had a very long, very weird day.
and I think I speak for the group when I say That we are not against breaking your eye sockets...
if we don't get some answers.
well, I'm at your service, sir.
what would you like to - where are we?
I'm afraid I don't know.
that is not an answer.
okay, Charlie.
where did you come from? - My apartment. Behind the hotel.
I think she means before that.
a man called to tell me I had the job starting the next day.
I went to bed and woke up here.
and that didn't seem funny to you?
I'm used to it by now.
one of you will be checking out.
the taxi - I saw one from my window!
Y- you're taking me? Why me?
so, where are you taking us?
Janet Cooper is my wife.
you're a monster. No, I'm just a businessman.
I need you to deliver a message to him.
I want to leave, just like Joe and Janet did.
I can't help you get out of here.
just feels like surrender.
I need to know the plans for Janet.
thank you, daddy.
are you threatening withdrawal? Yes or no, Joe.
there's a wolf in me...
fangs pointed for tearing gashes.
a red tongue for raw meat and the hot lapping of blood.
I keep this wolf because the wilderness gave it to me.
and the wilderness will not let it go.
there is a baboon in me.
clamoring claw, dog-faced, yawping a galoot's hunger.
o, I got a zoo. I got a menagerie inside my
what the...
Joe, where are you?
for I am the keeper of the zoo.
I say 'yes' and 'no.'
I sing and kill and love and work.
you shouldn't be down here.
is this how you get off, Tom?
watching us sleep
while you recite Carl Sandburg poetry?
Hey, I'm just doing my job,
just like you should be doing your job.
do you like your job - watching?
monitoring.
just like someone else is monitoring us right now.
what has got your knickers in such a twist
that you would go and break protocol for the second time in less than two days
and bust my hump about following orders?
you know what's bothering me.
the woman?
there's no place for that here, my friend.
there just isn't.
I thought you understood that.
Yeah, so did I.
there's something about her.
I don't know.
I mean, haven't you ever had feelings for another - Don't
don't complete that sentence.
I don't want to have to red card you.
you'd do that? - I would.
go. You'd better get back up there.
go.
I like you, Joe. Try not to do anything stupid.
I'll try.
morning. Hey.
you're up early.
Yeah.
I, uh... I just went for a walk.
couldn't sleep.
I know.
I haven't slept since we got here,
except that one night in the...cabin.
are you coming to breakfast?
just need to clean up, then, yeah.
meet you there?
okay.
okay, see you.
Hey, have you guys seen Tori?
she's probably at breakfast.
no, we were supposed to go down together,
and I just went to her room to wake her up,
and nothing is there.
what do you mean, "nothing"?
it means it's been swept clean, sanitized
no sign anyone was ever in that room.
we should do a sweep of the town.
Yeah, agreed.
aren't we overreacting a little?
I mean, she might've just gotten up early, and...
okay, maybe not Tori,
but I think that it's a reach to think that she just disappeared from the town.
maybe it's not such a reach. Maybe Tori was right.
maybe her father was keeping her here to teach her some kind of lesson.
well, if that's true, then there's hope for all of us.
Oh, my god, Tori.
who is this?
what the hell?
Oh, my god.
she's got a pulse. She's alive.
Where's Tori?
Yes, ma'am.
hurry up. Here, here.
come on.
she's barely breathing.
Really?
Ooh, somebody partied a little too hardy last night.
who the hell is that?
her name, you think? - Could be.
Yeah. Has the look of a prison tat.
Hey, guys, hold on.
I asked you a question. Who is this woman?
well, it's not Tori.
well, duh. Of course it's not Tori.
look at her.
wait. Wait, wait, wait.
what happened to Tori? - We don't know.
her room was empty no sign of her.
she got out? - We hope so.
what do you think that means?
webs signify a lot of things
that you're trapped somewhere like prison or you
killed somebody.
Oh, well, that's great.
we've traded a crazy party girl for a tatted junkie jailbird.
Nope, she was in a hospital.
look.
these needle marks are all from the same day,
brand-new, and medically administered.
Yeah, so says you.
well, I need a cup of coffee. - Why don't you go get one?
I think I will. Yeah.
you know, and, fortunately, Hop sing and his merry band of Chinamen make a decent cup.
so, good luck with the tattoo girl.
good morning, Mr. Blackham.
how did we sleep last night?
let's take her upstairs.
ready? My room.
watch her head.
what the hell happened now?
why is that woman wearing Tori's clothes?
Where's Tori?
I'm VERY SORRY, WE NEED SOMEONE TO IDENTIFY HER.
YES.THAT'S HER
my BABY.
I APOLOGIZE.
understandable , SIR.
how COULD THIS HAPPEN?
who COULD HAVE DONE THIS?
I ASSURE YOU WE WILL CONTINUE TO INVESTIGATE THIS SAD MATTER VIGOROUSLY. AMBASSADOR FAIRCHILD.
Yes.
keep ME POSTED ON YOUR PROGRESS.
of COURSE, SIR.
thank YOU VERY MUCH.
you've really added to that.
Yeah, I got a lot more to go.
my head's working faster than my hand.
Tori gone. Good thing or bad thing?
good question.
I want to think that she's back in Rome with a glass of Barolo.
I hope so, too.
but you don't think so.
we can't be certain of anything.
it's been more than two weeks,
and we're no closer to knowing why we're here than the day we arrived.
you know that Agatha Christie mystery "And Then There Were None" ?
anyway...
all these people get invited to this island,
and then - they don't know why
but then one by one, they're murdered.
by who?
by someone pretending to be a guest.
by the person you'd least expect.
are you saying...
one of us could be doing all this? - Yeah.
that doesn't make any sense.
does anything make any sense here?
I'm scared.
I swear, nothing's gonna happen to you.
all right?
you're fired.
you can't just fire me!
and yet I have.
I mean, I would like to take full credit for your axing,
but I think most of the thanks goes to your police-detective friend, Gomez.
he called the publishers.
funny how they don't like having suspected felons on the payroll.
Kat, come on. You said you were gonna help me.
Unh-unh. I never said that.
I distinctly remember hearing you say that you were gonna help me.
what you said is, "Will you please help me find my ex-wife, "who I knocked up then abandoned right before
let's see - "right before I started sleeping with you?
I don't remember saying it quite that way.
but that's what I heard.
you know the all-too-sad irony?
I could've cared less that you were married, but I don't like being lied to.
I don't like it one little bit.
I'm sorry.
no, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry that I was such an idiot to think that maybe you weren't just sleeping with me to keep your job.
that was never it.
look...
I won't argue with you about my honesty issues.
I- I obviously need to work at that.
but the way I felt about you...
feel about you...
is real.
it's very real.
you're amazing, you know that?
you are so full of it.
goodbye, mark.
and don't let that proverbial door hit you on that bony ass of yours.
no change? - No.
do you think she could be in a coma?
it's possible.
I guess that's lucky for her.
she doesn't know what she's missing.
wait a minute!
Hey, hey, hey.
Erika? Is that your name?
I'm Joe. This is Janet.
it's okay. You're safe.
Y- you're okay. We're gonna help you.
everything's o- aah!
stop! It's not gonna work!
we tried, okay?
we even broke through temporarily,
but we ran into something worse.
you cannot get out of this place.
Erika, the only hope we have is sticking together!
Hey. Turn up the TV.
turn up the TV.
after this song.
turn up the TV!
fine.
whatever.
the U. S. Ambassador has been notified.
well-known party girl in diplomatic circles,
disappeared more than two weeks ago.
her body was found this morning In the famous Caligari fountain.
and there is ambassador Franklin Fairchild entering the police station in Rome.
at this time, authorities have no suspects in the murder of the ambassador's daughter.
if you've done anything to her, you bastards...
thank you, Linda, for that report.
recapping our top story, Victoria Fairchild,
the 25-year-old daughter of Franklin Fairchild, the ambassador to Italy,
was found unharmed by police today in the Prizi district.
I am very grateful to have my daughter back safe and sound.
I am also grateful to the Italian authorities,
who pursued this matter so tirelessly to such a happy result.
thank you.
Oh, god!
okay, okay, I get it. You like it rough.
Ohh! Oh, god. What are you doing?
drink it
so, you feel like telling me what happened with Tori?
is this becoming a habit with you?
where is she? Ms. Fairchild? No longer with us.
Meaning? - Joe, you know what that means.
who's next? - No idea.
all right, but someone.
Yes, Joe, there will be other eliminations. There always are.
Janet?
don't know, don't want to know.
what's with this new woman?
she's a trip and a half, isn't she? She's wild.
who is she?
okay, Joe, enough with the questions.
I got work to do. So do you.
Oh, hey, uh, try the pressed duck tonight.
you won't be disappointed.
somebody! Somebody, help me!
Oh, no.
it looks like we've had ourselves a busy afternoon,
haven't we, Mr. She tried to kill me.
who?
that crazy bitch.
which one?
look, you got to stop joking around, man!
we're all in danger, okay?
you got to help me.
we got - we got to stick together!
okay. Okay.
but it's time you realized, Mr. Blackham,
that it's survival of the fittest around here.
does this hurt? - Aah!
Oh, I'm sorry. Oh. I'm sorry.
okay, best of luck.
I'll get you some ice, sir.
stop her!
Hey, stop her!
stop! Stop! Hey!
Erika! I told you, okay?
you don't have to be afraid of us.
it's okay.
it's okay. You can trust us.
Hey! Hey, grab her, grab her!
Oh, no.
Erika, it's okay.
okay, Erika, we're not gonna hurt you.
Erika, come on. You're safe here.
Erika, you have got to calm down.
No!
no, no, no, no!
No!
Joe, the door!
I can't get it! I can't open it, Janet!
open the door!
just talk to me.
okay.
I'll do the talking, then.
my name's Janet - Janet Cooper.
I live in Presidio park in San Francisco.
one night, I'm kissing my daughter good night.
and the next day, I'm grabbed in a park...
and I end up here.
I'm just saying
I'm scared as hell, too...
...of this place and...
what they might do to us...
...and what they might do to my daughter.
okay?
well, the only thing you got to be afraid of now...
...is me.
what's going on, Tom?
business as usual. - Really?
this is not part of the protocol!
slight modification.
no, you need to stop it.
now! - Sorry, pal.
no can do. No, no, no.
how long are they supposed to be in there?
until we have a result, Joe, or until their oxygen runs out.
the vault is a vacuum chamber, slowly sucking the air out.
meaning they'll die in there?
Yes, Joe, that is a possible outcome.
back off.
you can't help her, Joe!
you got to let it play out.
no, the hell I do.
they're watching, you know.
and listening.
good.
I'm gonna cut this bitch's throat If you don't open that door!
it's not gonna work.
shut up!
they won't respond.
I'll do it. I swear!
d- don't move.
honestly, I- I don't want to hurt you.
I've already died once.
I don't know that a second time would be any worse.
what happened?
they got locked in the vault.
what? How?
it just closed, and I couldn't stop it.
try the wall. Try the wall.
good.
it should take him about, oh...
50 years to break through.
that's steel-reinforced concrete
just like in prison.
you are friggin' unbelievable.
I know. I don't know what to say.
in case it slipped your mind, breaking and entering is a crime in this state.
I still have a key. You didn't ask for it back, so I
so, naturally, you assumed that you could just break into my apartment whenever you like.
I tried to access my nexus account, but it was canceled.
that's because I fired you!
I think I'm onto something, Kat.
I don't give a flying rat's ass what you think!
listen to me.
this is bigger than anything to do with Janet.
I know it sounds crazy, but I think somehow,
her disappearance is linked to that ambassador's daughter.
you have really gone off the deep end.
there's something else going on here.
if Janet was abducted
just shut up about her!
would you just shut up?!
there's something about this that I just can't let go of.
that's because you still care for Janet.
no, no. It's...
I don't think it's that.
not in the way you mean.
but I have to keep searching until I know what happened to Janet.
I have to find her for Megan.
for your daughter
the one you abandoned.
you know what, Mark?
you do whatever it is that you need to do.
you just do it without my help.
get out now!
get out!
next time, I call the police.
got to give that Joe guy points for trying.
he's been at it, what...
10 minutes straight?
Yeah.
you've known him a long time?
just since we got here.
but he means a lot to you.
he's just someone I trust.
there's your first mistake.
trusting anyone...
especially a man.
he wants to get out of here as much as I do.
maybe.
why do you want to get out of here so bad?
get back to my daughter.
what's her name?
she'll be 6.
she with her father?
he, uh, left before she was born.
I haven't seen him since.
you ever think maybe that's a good thing?
almost every day.
you got kids?
son.
Anton.
he'd be about 11 now - 11 years, 3 months, 2 days.
he don't live with me, though.
where is he now? - Foster care.
Where's your daughter?
I don't know.
with my mother, I guess, but that terrifies me.
when's the last time you saw Anton?
a long time ago.
I haven't been a very good mother to him.
I wanted to be.
just didn't turn out that way.
well, hopefully, you'll get to see him again, too.
probably not.
no, really.
we're gonna get out of this place, Erika.
well, I don't know if you've noticed...
but we're running out of air.
come on!
where are you going?
to get help.
Blackham and Morse are useless.
I know.
sir, will you be wanting turn-down service tonight?
and what about you, ma'am?
when you said you'd already died once...
what did you mean?
you see these?
lethal injection.
you were gonna be executed?
I was executed.
courtesy of the state of Texas.
last thing I remember, I'm laying on a gurney.
as everything started to fade...
all I can remember thinking was...
dying ain't so bad after all.
next thing I know...
I'm looking up at your pretty face,
guessing I must be in heaven.
why'd you run, then?
cause hell is where I ought to be...
where I deserve to be.
I figured it must be a trick of the devil or something.
is this heaven...
...or hell?
neither.
this place is very real.
Yeah.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
Janet, are you still with me?
you're still with me, right?
Yeah.
what am I gonna do with you, Joe?
you need to open that vault.
come on, you can't let them die in there.
everything you've gone through,
everything you've worked for
you'd really throw it away for her?
Yes.
sorry, my friend.
I've got my orders.
stop it.
stop the countdown.
this is your last chance to change your mind and get back on point.
open the door!
come on. Come on.
thank you.
Where's Joe?
right here.
okay? Huh?
you're okay.
you're all right.
you're the last person I expected to see again.
no kidding.
it's a mystery even to me why I'm here.
you're still fired- Kat
you want to come in? - No.
this is as far as I go.
I understand.
Thanks.
for this.
none of that means dick If you don't face up to the real issue, Mark.
go see your daughter.
you owe it to Megan, and you owe it to yourself, too.
Oh, my god, you're okay!
Oh, thank god.
I've got you, you bitch!
you took my clothes! - Get off me!
what are you guys doing? ! she's the enemy!
no, she's not.
stay away from me.
Hey...I'm sorry.
I didn't know what I was doing here.
it's okay.
I understand.
Hey!
don't you think you owe me an apology, too?!
dream on, loser.
yes?
thank you for your cooperation, Mr. Ambassador.
I know how difficult it must have been for you.
go to hell.
if there had been any other way...
I won't participate in any more of your charades.
you will. You must.
you've already taken my little girl from me.
what more could you do?
I'm afraid quite a bit more, Mr. Ambassador.
quite a bit more.
As-salamu alaykum!
As-salamu alaykum.
you thinking about Megan?
always.
good.
I want you to know something.
no matter what...
I got your back.
Hey, that's - that's a great bike.
bet you can't wait to get rid of those training wheels.
you're not supposed to talk to me.
mommy says I can't talk to strangers.
mommy's right.
that's rule number one.
I'm not a stranger. I'm...
you're that reporter from the Register.
Megan, sweetheart, go show me how well you can ride your new bike nana got you.
I believe that parental consent is required before one can interview a child, Mr...
what?
no. You're...
who you think I am. Yes.
I know what you must think about me, but right now...
I'm just somebody who knows Megan's mother.
is that true?
what do you want?
I just want what's best for your granddaughter.
I, uh...
I want to tell Megan something.
you be very careful what you say.
it's okay.
your mommy misses you very much.
you talked to mommy?
no.
but I will.
I'll find your mommy.
I, uh... I promise.
Hi.
how are you feeling?
I feel better. Thanks.
I wanted to apologize.
what for?
you getting hurt.
it was my responsibility to keep you all safe.
I let you down.
all of you.
that's not true.
look, we're in this together.
and we're gonna get out of it, somehow, together.
I know it.
just like Tori.
Tori's dead, Moira.
well, that's just it - she isn't.
I know this sounds crazy, but I was in the dress shop,
and a TV was there with a news report
showing Tori alive, back in Rome.
it had to have been some kind of trick.
no, it wasn't. She's still alive. I know it.
I always knew this place
was some kind of military training camp.
they test you to see if you'll crack under pressure.
Graham... - I failed, Moira.
let's just leave it at that.
wait. Whoa, whoa, wait, wait. I...
I got to tell you something.
it's about Joe.
you've done it now, Joe.
couldn't let Janet die, Tom.
this wasn't about her, okay?!
this was about you, pal - you and me.
this was our test.
ours?
Yes, ours.
you put us both in danger. Understand that.
I do.
can't help the way I feel, Tom.
I was hoping you could.
Yeah.
so, now what?
I don't know.
guess we'll just have to...
wait and see.
but I'm guessing it won't be good.
your flight to rome's on "perin four hours...
that guy knows something. We have to talk to him.
that man has got "snitch" written all over him.
using poison?
Stefano: victoria was very alive. We were very much in love.
the ambassador is responsible for all this?
he's capable of almost anything.
we're locked in.
you got to tell us the truth. I'm the one holding the cure.
now, you tell me. Are you one of them?
Janet, come here.
do you see that?
I don't see it.
right there Looks like a screw, but it's really one of their cameras.
Joe, joe, joe. You think i'm that stupid?
Oh, my god. You knew the cameras were here.
Yes. I knew they were here, But i didn't know where they all were.
and you let them keep spying on me?
it's not that simple. - You could have taken these cameras out at any time.
it would've put you in danger.
it would've stopped you and your pervert friends from watching.
so, tell me, do you guys look up girls' skirts, as well?
they take precautions to avoid prurient surveillance.
why So they won't see me naked?
who cares? Did they see me crying, joe?
did they share videos Of me screaming my daughter's name?
I'm sorry for what happened.
you're sorry.
I don't want an apology, joe. I want you to get me out of here.
well, i can't. I'm no longer one of them, janet.
Yeah, but you were. - Yes, i was, After i was kidnapped,
just like you, just like thousands of others.
so, tell me, when you were on the other side,
what were you people gonna do to us?
was it for ransom, or was it some cruel experiment?
they're trying to do good.
that is not an answer.
did you talk to him? - Yes.
did he give up anything useful?
Joe insists that he was kidnapped, Same as us, as were others just like us, And it's been happening for over 50 years.
for 50 years? - But who Who is doing this?
is it some kind of political thing?
I don't know, okay? He just said that it was for good reasons.
Yeah, he says a lot of crap.
don't you guys see he's just telling us Exactly what they want us to hear?
joe: want to know the real reason?
well, i think you owe us that much.
truth is i only know a little.
this place...
this organization
operates like a foundation or think tank,
devoted to peace and progress.
they analyze vast amounts of information About the way the world is going,
and they make bets based on that information Intelligent bets.
what kind of bets? - Bets on people.
my understanding is that people are selected
because something about them may suggest
that they may grow to have great influence on the world.
well, that sounds really great,
except for grabbing people off the street and holding them prisoner.
Yeah.
but they believe they're They're doing good.
Hitler thought he was doing good.
Hey, just let him answer. - Bill: oh, are you kidding?
do you really want to hear joe spin on About what a great guy he is
and about the wonderful people Who kidnapped us and trapped us here?
Yes, i do, and don't yell at me. - What?
if you have a problem with me, don't take it out on moira.
Oh, hey, i'm sorry, moira.
Oh, my god!
sorry son of a bitch! - What are you guys doing?!
can't you see that he's just messing with us?!
I'm trying to help.
you hear me? I'm trying to help. - Oh, yeah.
I'm trying to tell you the truth.
Oh, yeah, your truth, their truth.
you want to know what the real truth is?
you and your buddies are scum!
and you guys You're all scum, too,
if you're actually gonna buy into this crap.
it's the truth.
why'd you come down here?
why'd you let me in?
to say goodbye to a guy who used to be a friend.
I'm not going anywhere.
you think they're gonna watch passively While you piss all over the program?
I'm willing to take that risk.
it's not just you, joe.
you're risking eight lives.
you could force them to zero out this entire town.
eight? - Yeah, joe, me included.
God. Grow a brain, man.
this is a vacation romance to her Stockholm syndrome with a hot date.
the second she's out of here, she'll dump you.
you're not her type.
it's none of your business. - Yeah, it is.
what am i supposed to do if they red-Card you? - Disobey.
no, joe, i'm still in the program, remember?
you're the only person i still trust, tom.
the suits hate me.
so do the people in this town.
Yeah, and whose fault is that?
anybody else?
Yeah, i'll take one.
you know, i think this joe thing is actually good news.
how do you figure that?
we can get out of here sooner. - Right.
no, look, listen, okay? It's simple.
we take joe hostage. - I'm sorry. What?
Yeah, i'm listening. - Hostage? We're already hostages.
in a prison riot, The prisoners turn the guards into prisoners.
like you know.
Oh, i know.
and then the police move in, And they slaughter all of the prisoners.
and besides, you already tried that strategy With the night manager.
Yeah, and if you, mcnair, and joe Hadn't have stopped us,
we'd all be home right now.
I highly doubt that.
I say we keep together, Stay alert, and keep our eyes on the enemy we can see.
Joe is not the enemy.
after everything that you found out, everything joe has done,
how in the hell can you still defend him?
because i just know I
I know that he's not the person that you think he is.
that's because you're in love with him. - I'm not in love with him!
whatever The point i'm trying to make Is none of us is safe until joe's dealt with.
Joe does not need to be dealt with.
whose side are you on, bright eyes His... or ours?
ours!
I'm on our side.
you wanted to see me, charlie?
Yeah. Got a minute? - Sure.
there's something i need to tell you.
I don't need to get back to my wife...
because she's dead.
I'm sorry.
did you know that?
no.
Yeah. She died.
and i wanted to die.
then you kidnapped me.
not me.
see, i was kidnapped, just like you.
whatever.
my point is that when charlotte was gone,
being abducted seemed like a trade-Up.
it dawned on me That the kidnappers might kill me.
and you know what?
I didn't mind.
I wasn't sad, exactly, just... done.
I thought,"this is impeccable timing I'm ready to die, and they're gonna kill me.
but life is full of surprises, joe.
don't i know it.
and the biggest surprise is this
I've still got a lot of life left in me.
being here may be the best thing that ever happened to me.
even with all the stock-Market gyrations,
I'm worth roughly $80 million.
I can get you anything you want
girls, cars.
maybe you want a career, An education, world travel.
what do you want, joe?
what do you want, charlie?
I want out...
soon.
what do you expect me to do?
anything you can.
if there's a list, make sure i'm on it.
you take care of me, and i will take care of you.
you think about what you want And just know that it's yours for the asking...
...if you get me out.
I've had people threaten my life, repeatedly,
but i've never run from a bomb before.
that explosion was something else.
I mean, windows blew out a block away. - I've been shot at.
shot at, shot over, bad guys falling dead all around us.
I've never been kidnapped by thugs.
you're a wanted man on two continents.
none of this bothers you?
honestly, i've never felt more alive or more motivated
to get to the bottom of this.
Ciao. - Ciao.
come stai? - Va bene.
Stefano: victoria bought that dress the day she went missing.
this photo must have been taken after that.
she may be alive. Where did you get this?

No! Oh! No!

I don't feel right about this.
Yeah, well, get over it. Give me the key.
Hey, hey, hey, hey. You're wrecking his room.
Yeah, so?

we're listening. - Your ex-Wife and my daughter were taken
by a very powerful organization.
for 31 years, i have been part of that organization.
what's it called? - It has no name.
but when they found me,
I was an apartment manager in bloomington, a nobody.
they made me who i am.
they expect me to do their bidding, and i comply.
is there anyone else like you?
I'll take that as a yes. How many?
enough to exert a quiet control.
we're never in your papers, mr. Renbe.
we manufacture people and events that you report as news.
why you, ambassador? - I never asked.
they were incredibly generous to me,
and i believed in what they were doing...
until they killed my daughter, tori.
my god.
if they knew i was talking to you, We'd all be dead within a week
a heart attack, car accident No one would ever suspect a thing.
are you willing to take them on?
Yes.
good.
whoever gets tangled up with them, Their life will never be the same.
one person has made it out alive.

now, you know this is not necessary.
Oh, come on.

do you want the cuffs off or not?
look, i can explain what happened.
you better work hard on that explanation.
some day i might want to hear it.

it's on the dresser. - Thanks.
some of those parolees, uh, They're the best people you'll ever meet.

just that, uh...
but i'll tell you the rest later.

what's wrong, moira?

cherry cola from 1983...
made with cane sugar, the way god intended.
Thanks. - Yeah.

something about you keeping files on us?
those were planted
the people that are holding us.
they are some slippery bastards.
do you believe me?
I do.
you carry yourself like a trustworthy man.
I also believe...
your characterization...
of the group that's holding us.
I don't agree with what they're trying to do, but...
you do.
and i respect that.
if i let you go, I want your word that you're gonna try to do Everything you can to get me out of this place.

I know it did.
I remember when i came in.

it was infectious.
I wanted what you had.
and now you're gonna kill me.
is this what you wanted to become?
do you think i want to do this? - No.
we were friends, man Close friends.
and you threw it away.
Janet's the best thing that ever happened to me.

he says he has someone he needs removed.
I tell him i don't do that kind of thing.
he says it's the bomb maker.
he shows me one of the triggers they found.
they know who he is and where,
and there's 100 grand if i take him out.
did you do it?
did a good job.
later on, i found out The guy i killed was an accountant.
he was going to testify against the mercenary's company
in an embezzlement trial.
he was no bomb maker
the father of three little girls.
kind of snapped after that,
did some things i'm not proud of.

I feel completely violated.

it was right here.
well, he also told me That you threw over this whole program because of me.
that's true.
my back Ohh, it's still messed up.
put a hot towel on it.
I don't know what to do anymore, joe.
my daughter turned 6 last week.
and i wasn't there for her.
Megan has no idea where i am
or if i'm alive or dead.
and she's gonna carry that scar for the rest of her life.
I hate the people that did this to me.
and i should hate you, too, joe, for being one of them, But...
I don't.
that's the hardest thing of all.
what do you want to do, janet?
I want to get out of here.
Tom's death left some holes.
we might be able to escape.
it's gonna involve hard work, and it's risky.
we may die in the attempt.
but if we're gonna try, we need to act now.
think about it seriously before you answer.
mommy!
al Roker? Anybody? No! Nobody.
face it, Stu, you're smalltime. And you've got a credibility problem.
don't fucking worry about my credibility! All right?
what about yours?
look, it's our friends from channels two and five. Your local news, Stuart.
you couldn't do this for your clients if your life depended on it.
but me, I've made you famous.
stick your head out so they can get a better angle on you.
they're here to cover me dying. - How ungrateful.
those cameras will make the police very careful.
so come on, smile a little for them. - Can you tap into that phone call?
should be no problem. - Except...
...We'll need a warrant if he's on the line with his shrink.
fuck that. I'm not gonna jeopardize this on a technicality.
look, tracing, that's not a violation, right?
as long as we don't listen in. - Okay, this is what I want you to do.
I want you to find who he's talking to and their current location.
all right? We get that?
I want somebody to find out what's going on.
look across the street and see what everybody in New York is looking at.
you're the man, Stuart. You're the center of attention.
wait till this goes national: ABC, CBS, CNN, UPN...
you're gonna hit the whole alphabet, Stu.
I'll be forgotten about in a week.
no one ever remembers the names of the victims.
it's the killers that get the cover of Time magazine. Right?
think about it. You'd be famous. Ted Bundy, John Wayne Gacy...
...fucking Jeffrey Dahmer. Name a victim. You can't.
anyway, I don't deserve to be the center of attention.
it ought to be you they're covering. - That attention would embarrass me.
I know exactly the spin to put on this. - How terror inspires your creativity?
listen, this could be a media frenzy, all right? You'd get Barbara Walters...
...I mean, Larry King if you still wanted him.
that approach seems predicated upon me surrendering without killing you.
listen, we can make you sympathetic, sit with a writer, bang out a book.
you know, movie of the week. Get America on your side.
all right, you killed Leon because he was gonna kill me.
you killed Leon to protect me. All right?
in a city where nobody looks out for anybody, you took a stand.
I'm your best witness.
so you want me to trust you to get me out of this?
Yes, I do. I want you to trust me. Trust me.
Stu, you must think I'm crazy.
Oh, shit. Here comes Braman. - I'll take care of him.
Hey. Should've waited for me to initiate contact with the suspect.
I established a rapport. Let you know if I need help.
are you grandstanding for TV cameras?
or do you want to leave this to a professional?
until a professional gets here, I'll handle it.
you're a funny guy. All right, you get somebody else killed, it's on your head.
got it?
this is what I want to do, okay? This is the City Hotel here.
I want three guys in the lobby here. And five sharpshooters up here.
see if you can get me two in the subway.
what the fuck?
not going to answer it? - I can't. I can't reach for the phone.
the cops will think it's a gun. - I'll bet it's Kelly.
she's probably heard what you did. She's sick with worry.
I'm not gonna make her feel any better, am I?
well, you could ask her to forgive you, Stuart.
you could confess your sins and beg for absolution, come clean.
you're in this position because you're not telling the truth.
I'm in this position because you got a gun!
no. Stuart, that is the sin of spin. Avoidance and deception.
you're being given a chance here to make things right. Now, talk to her.
look, I can't. Please. - I am telling you to answer that phone!
excuse me! Excuse me! - You can't cross in front of here!
answer it!
look, I can't. Please. - Don't make me hurt you!
talk to your wife! - It's not her calling.
how can you be so sure? - It's you. It's you, you miserable fuck!
damn, you got me! You continue to impress.
you could shoot me, but you want them to do it!
Yes, well, that's an option. - Yeah.
captain. - Yeah?
this lady says the perp's her husband. Here's her ID.
I couldn't believe when I saw this. - Who do you think he's talking to?
I don't know. I spoke to him earlier today and I told him...
...that there was a man who called me. - A man?
did this upset him, that you were talking to other men?
Yes, he did seem a little upset, but it's, no... It's not like that.
I didn't even know who this guy was. - Who's his psychiatrist?
he doesn't have one. - That you know of.
I've been with him three years, married for one. I'd know if he was in therapy.
I wish to God he had been. I saw somebody after my divorce.
it kept me from picking up a gun, doing something I would regret.
look, Stu didn't kill anyone. - Ma'am, under the circumstances...
...you need to consider whether your husband is who you thought he was.
cause according to these witnesses over here, he has a gun...
...he has used that gun and let's pray to God that he doesn't use it again.
captain?
if you can think of any dispute he's having currently, please, tell me.
we're clearing City Hotel. I can stage an assault unit within feet of the booth.
we've also got sharpshooters securing rooftop positions.
let me know when you're in position. - Absolutely.
what about that wire tap?
we're working on it. You gotta hold tight a while, all right?
Yeah, no problem. No problem. - Okay.
Mrs. Shepard. Mrs. Shepard.
does he like being called Stuart or Stu? - Stu. Call him Stu.
Stu. Okay.
come with me, please.
Stu.
I have your wife with me.
that's how you knew she wasn't calling. You deceived me.
Stu! - She's not my wife.
are you okay?
can you just talk to me? - Yes, talk to her, Stu.
look, she's not my wife!
she's some fucked-up, failed actress I wouldn't handle. She's stalking me!
you aren't making this up? You are his wife, right?
Yes, here's a photograph of us together.
I don't know what he's talking about.
Stu. Listen to your wife.
she only wants what's best for you. - She's not my wife!
Stu, nobody wants to hurt you.
we just want to know what happened. - Yeah, very good.
go home, you fucking lunatic! You hear me? Go home!
please don't make things worse. Just come out.
just do what they tell you to do.
your wife is a crazy actress stalker and you don't know her.
that's an interesting match. - Get her out of here!
enough. I don't want to agitate this. - You out of your fucking mind?
come on, get the woman out of here! - No. I don't know what's going on.
he's bleeding... We... We're fine. This morning everything was fine.
you just stay here. Just stay here, okay?
okay. - I think she did some good.
you got a number of that lawyer? - No, we don't have a lawyer.
he asked for his lawyer to come negotiate his surrender.
well, we never needed one. - Well, you need a good one now.
look, you'll do me best by staying near here. Okay?
I'm gonna get your husband out alive.
I'm not going to let you fuck this up! - Get Mrs. Shepard out of here.
you know, get her some coffee or something.
you're gonna lose this guy. You need some kind of redemption.
what are you seeing a shrink for? - Get the fuck out of my face!
don't fucking touch me! - I'm not stepping down!
you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
you'd think she didn't know she was being watched.
what? - But beautiful women always know.
you talking about Kelly? - That false indifference, superior air...
...It's just a tease. They want eyes on them.
why does she put on her makeup, do her hair, dress so nicely?
not for her husband that she hardly ever sees.
no, it's for somebody else to notice. I notice.
what are you doing? Stay away from her. Leave her alone.
I'm giving her what she wants.
I bet you've never looked at Kelly the way I am right now.
don't you dare fucking hurt her. - Don't I dare?
I'm not the one who has hurt her, Stuart.
what they can't know is what we do to them in our minds. Right?
you sick fuck! - The perfect violation.
leave her out of this. - How many times...
...have you had sex with Pam in that hotel bedroom in your head?
would you really miss Kelly if she was gone?
that's it. Not another word. I'm not talking to you.
your choices put other people in jeopardy.
when are you gonna learn that?
this is funny. Stuart, look uptown.
these geniuses are still at the juncture box trying to tap in.
only I have installed an encryption device at both ends of the line.
there's no chance of a trap trace...
...so now they've gotta try some fancy LoJack instrument. It's really sad.
I hope you weren't pinning your hopes on those morons.
truth is, I'm on a wireless A. D.S. With a cloned number.
it'll take a half an hour to find out I call forwarded through Philadelphia.
and let me tell you, this will all be over before they can get a dial tone.
we can't get a trace or break into the line. It's like a ball of rubber bands.
I knew there was something weird about this. You keep working on it.
Stu. Stuart, come on, you're behaving like a child.
still gonna give me the silent treatment?
hello. Stuart, don't do this, please. Come on.
my sainted mother used to do this. She used to dish this out.
Stuart, please don't do this.
Stuart, you're bringing back my unhappy childhood.
Stuart, talk to me! Please, talk to me! I can't take it! Stu, please...
I'm kidding. I had a very happy childhood.
Hey, there's our girl again. I wasn't planning on killing her...
...but plans change.
just tell me what the fuck you want from me.
hello. There you are. I thought I was talking to myself again.
anything you want. I'll do it. Just tell me.
tell Kelly about the real Stu, about your little motel.
and then you'll let us go? - Why not?
Kelly! - That's a start.
baby! - Hold her back!
Hey! - Talk to me!
grab her! Keep her back! - Yes?
I'm listening.
Kelly, I called some woman.
every day. - Every day.
I was attracted to this other woman. And I called her and...
I wanted to fuck her. - And I wanted to sleep with her.
no. I wanted to fuck her.
say it. Say it! - And I wanted to fuck her.
I'm sorry. - Whatever you did, I don't care.
please, just come out of the booth. Okay?
that's all I did. That's all I did. I'm sorry.
all right, I've done what you asked. That's it. I've had enough of this.
I haven't.
you said you'd let us go. - I changed my mind.
you miserable fuck. You can't do this. You can't do this to me.
look, I took all your shit. I did everything you fucking asked.
you lied to me. I'm done with this.
I've fucking had enough. You can go fuck yourself! Later.
he hung up. - Maybe they already got a trace.
ESU, ESU?
I'm giving myself up! - He's coming out!
heads up! - I want to see you toss away your weapon!
throw the weapon outside the booth! Stay where you are!
first, the weapon! - Don't hurt him! Please, don't hurt him!
there's no fucking gun! - Stay right where you are!
I want you to turn around. Interlock your fingers behind your head. Okay?
please give them the gun! - Kelly, no!
get back! Kelly!
Freeze! - Get back! Get back!
get back! - Okay! Okay!
I gotta answer it.
Freeze! Don't move.
hold your fire!
hold your fire!
hold your fire.
hold. Hold. - Please.
go ahead. Answer it. - What the fuck are you doing?
he's coming out!
answer the phone.
you fucking coward. - Hi, Stu.
now, you've had your little tantrum and you said some things in anger...
...that I am willing to forget.
get her back in the car! I want her in the car.
if he's not the shooter, then who the fuck is?
captain, what the fuck is up with the phone calls?
so can we start over? - You lied.
you can't know the pain of betrayal until you've been betrayed.
sniper in one of these buildings. I want you to talk to ESU.
I want you to get one of these guys, this building.
start looking up there from window to window till you find the perp. Okay?
I want you to do it quickly, and I want you to do it quietly. All right?
Where's the ESU sergeant?
you said we could go.
you said you'd let us go. - Relax, Stuart.
nobody gets it right the first time.
you've done better than others. You will get a chance to end this.
I'm just not finished yet. - Yeah, well, I am.
there's nothing keeping me. - Besides the fear of death?
I dive out and you've got one shot. I'm gonna be dancing.
you think you can get me? - I could go for some target practice.
one shot, they look for you. Second shot, you give yourself away.
go on, Stuart, hang up!
trust your fate to friendly men in flak jackets with automatic weapons.
I'm sure you can patch up that little misunderstanding about the dead body.
cops can't prove I killed anyone. - You had motive.
no weapon. - Plenty of loudmouth witnesses.
no gun and I walk.
are you sure? - Yes!
yeah? You murder a guy and you forget where you stashed your gun?
why don't you lift the plastic ceiling panel and feel around?
Peekaboo!
what's up next to the florescent bulb? Check it out, Stu.
cops see me reach for something, they'll blow me away.
there's only one way to find out.
look, the slugs in that dead guy, they came from your rifle.
they're not gonna match a handgun. I've seen enough cop shows.
hollow points fragment on impact, Stuart. There's nothing to match.
only there's no gun up there. - Don't take my word for it.
see for yourself. There are rounds left in it.
I totally couldn't give a shit. - Come on. Don't disappoint me.
use your imagination. You'd shoot me if you got the chance, wouldn't you?
with a big fucking smile on my face.
there's the spirit.
now, what if I told you I was just above the theater, four floors up?
see the pink curtains?
there you go, Stuart. Yes.
Yoo-hoo!
Yoo-hoo!
why would you do that?
because it's fun. The odds are even now, Stuart.
isn't that what you wanted?
you know where I am, and you have a gun.
if you have it in you, you can take me down.
fuck!
they'd kill me before I got a shot. - Oh, you're probably right.
I'm not really there anyway.
you would've just spoiled some nice lady's curtains.
looks like someone watches the news.
who? - The motel.
Oh, God. - I think she could use a new headshot.
don't! - Then take down the gun.
look, this has nothing to do with her! - She has everything to do with this.
you're here and she's here because you called her.
now, take it down! Don't make me hurt Pam, Stuart.
take down the gun! - Hey, everybody, get ready.
hold on, hold on. Let's just see what he does, all right?
let's see what he's doing.
there's nothing there.
nothing but your fingerprints on the finest cop killer money can buy.
come on, Stu. Let's see it. - Fuck, no! It's staying there.
fine, then someone will have to take your place.
come on, Stu, you're in a perfect position.
how do you figure? - You get to choose between them.
Pamela or Kelly? Should I choose? One of them can take your place.
don't do this!
you've got to be more in touch with your feelings. I thought you only loved Kelly!
it's true! - But you lie to her.
it's complicated.
then I'll uncomplicate it, Stuart, by removing temptation. I say Pam.
No! Look, this isn't Pam's fault. This is all my fault!
she's innocent!
Ticktock, ticktock. Time's running out. Okay, Kelly, then.
you decide. - No, please!
come on, Stu. Don't you get the game yet?
you're a selfish guy. Pick one and save yourself.
blond or brunette? Time's running out.
you or them? Kelly or Pam? Kelly or Pam?
come on, Stu!
stop this.
I can't take this anymore. - What are you doing? Get up!
I was looking for my ring. Look... - Get up, Stuart!
stand up and be a man. You're embarrassing yourself.
captain! I got it. Listen.
the rifleman reports subject pulled a small, dark object out of his pocket.
all right. You're looking at a suicide on national fucking TV.
you gonna let me take this over?
tell everybody to hold on, to hold their fire.
everybody hold. Stay ready, but hold.
Stu. No more spinning, no more excuses.
What're you doing? Look, listen. Listen, please listen to me.
no more delays, Stuart.
look... I'm on my knees begging you not to kill me.
I will if you keep up this pathetic spectacle.
excuse me! He's on the phone, talking.
from up in your high window, you could kill anyone.
Yes, I know that, Stuart. - All right, and...
you could pick off any of the cops, with your rifle.
shut up and stand up!
look, why threaten Kelly?
you liked how she sounded on the phone at the store.
please don't hurt her. Don't fucking hurt my wife.
this doesn't have to end with me shooting you. You leave no choice.
now, get up! - All right.
okay, how does this end? Tell me how this ends.
people are gonna be eating dinner watching you die.
we got a sniper situation here.
what about that phone call to your store?
I got a phone call this afternoon. I think it was a prank call.
he told me Stu would be calling me from a phone booth.
how long will it take to get a record of her calls?
if he's using that secure line, we won't know more than now.
say he didn't. Let's assume he's a human, makes mistakes like all of us.
I need to get that number. I've been waiting for that number.
it was a guy. He sounded like mid-30's.
Mrs. Shepard? It would be safer if you got back in the car, okay?
please get back in the car. - Thank you.
I want you to divert incoming ESU units to Broadway and hold them there.
want me to clear the streets? - Yeah.
no, no, no. I don't want the sniper to be aware of any of our movements.
he's already got position on us.
let's not let him know we know too much, okay?
Hey, Jonah. - Yeah.
don't look up.
get me sharpshooters looking at those windows.
you got it, captain. - I'm gonna buy us some time here.
all right.
Stu! It's okay if I come out and talk to you for a second?
I don't know. - This guy is so lonely.
all he wants to do is talk. - You're walking through a bad dream...
...and you can't wake up. - Now he's really testing my patience.
you wanna wake up, Stu?
I wanna, but I got issues I can't talk about.
that your psychiatrist on the phone? - Yeah, yeah. I'm paying him overtime.
that was pretty brave what you did.
I mean, admitting all that stuff to your wife.
it was liberating, right? - Should've been.
maybe if I could be more honest with my wife then...
...I don't know, something would've turned out different.
Oh, please.
trust is the key. You trust me, Stu? - Get this man a seat on Oprah.
I wanna, but I got the issues I can't talk about.
Yes, lethal issues. Tell him to stay back.
look, don't come any closer.
Hey, I don't wanna cause or make anything harder for you.
Pam, Ramey, Kelly, people on the street, you've got lives in your hands.
I told you it's a private conversation. What the fuck do you want?
I wanna let you know that it's safe outside the booth.
it's not. - It's always, "Get out of the booth!
I like it in the fucking booth! All right? It's my world.
this is my booth, and I'm not coming out. All right?
never. - We're not gonna force you out...
...because there could be some miscalculation...
...and then I would never find out why this happened.
Stu, I'm afraid. I'm afraid that I'm gonna be standing by...
...and my men are gonna shoot some guy...
...and when we find out what's in his hand, once we turn over his body...
...and we see what he was threatening people with...
we realize that it was just a little black Bible.
or a cell phone. - Don't push me, Stu.
I'm not gonna let that happen here.
I wanted to make a phone call. One lousy call...
that's enough, Stu.
you got some bad news on that call? - The worst.
I bet you want to jump off the edge.
I've been falling ever since. - I'm gonna push him over the edge.
just say the word.
it's time to land.
when you hit bottom, you die. - I'm your safety net.
Oh, please, say the word.
if I tell you what you wanna know, you'll die too.
exactly.
I'm going. - Good.
but, Stu, we put a call out to your lawyer.
your wife, she gave us the number.
and I got my best men working on bringing him down. Okay?
that's it. The captain gets a bullet.
get out of here! Hear what I said, asshole?
get out of here, go on, now! Go! - Enough of this sideshow, Stu.
your sins have caught up to you. - So this is all some religious thing?
that explains it. Bible-crazed killer picks on fashion-obsessed PR guy.
tell me what you want, then. - What everyone wants...
...for the bad guy to get what he deserves.
go for the gun.
kill myself? - Yes.
it would be a rare, unselfish act.
we got hostile action. - Nothing is hostile until I say it is.
look, I can't find it. - Kelly, Pam, bam! Bam!
all right! Look, I found it. I got it.
then let's see it. Let everyone see it. - The cops'll kill me.
Yes. You're talking prime-time material now.
all this shit just to watch me die? - No.
to get you to do what's right. If you wanna save yourself, confess.
I already told Kelly everything. - Everything?
no. No more excuses and half-truths, Stuart.
you look out into those cameras and you bare your soul.
TV seems to help bring out the worst in people.
you should be fine.
How're those techs doing? Anything? - No, not yet. Not yet.
we haven't found your lawyer yet, Stu. But we're getting close. Okay?
Stuart, I'm offering you a chance to redeem yourself.
come on, humble yourself in front of your loved ones...
...and millions of strangers and me. It's do-or-die time.
what, you couldn't find anyone worse than me?
not a murderer or a child molester but a publicist...
...who has fantasies about pretty little actresses.
who spends money on Italian suits and dry cleaning...
...so people think he's important. Who doesn't waste time being nice...
...to people who are of no use to him. These are my crimes?
Stuart, I know your crimes. Tell them.
I've never done anything for anybody...
...who couldn't do something for me. I string along...
...a kid with promises that I'll pay him money.
I keep him around because he looks up to me.
Adam, if you're watching, don't be a publicist. You're too good for it.
I lie in person and on the phone. I lie to my friends.
I lie to newspapers and magazines who sell my lies to more and more people.
I'm just a part of a big cycle of lies. I should be fucking president.
I wear all this Italian shit because underneath, I still feel like the Bronx.
I think I need these clothes, and this watch.
my $2000 watch is a fake, and so am I.
I neglected the things I should've valued most.
I valued this shit.
I take off my wedding ring to call Pam. Kelly, that's Pam.
somebody got a 20 on this Pam? - Don't blame her.
I never told her if I was married, and if I did...
...she would've told me to go home.
Kelly, looking at you now, I'm ashamed of myself.
I mean, I work so hard on this image, on Stu Shepard, the asshole...
...who refers to himself in third person, that I only proved I should be alone.
I've been dressing up as something I'm not for so long...
...l'm so afraid you won't like what's underneath.
but here I am. I'm just flesh and blood and weakness.
I love you so fucking much.
I take off this ring because it only reminds me of how I've failed you.
and, I don't wanna give you up.
I wanna make things better, but it may not be my choice anymore.
you deserve better.
you're not gonna let me go. - No.
you never were. I know a thing about lies.
I know a thing or two about liars as well.
then why the confession?
I didn't do it for you.
right there. - Yeah, got that.
captain, captain. The call to his wife originated at 2: 17...
...at a hard line from the old Barkley Hotel.
you got a room? - 604.
second window from the corner. ESU units holding.
bring them in from 52nd Street.
cover the windows, doors, fire escape, every goddamn point of exit.
ESU, ESU, come in from the 52nd... - Stu!
your lawyer's coming down now! - Doors, fire escapes...
now!
at least you'll die with a clean conscience.
no, you're the one that's gonna die! Listen, you can hear them now.
they're coming to get you. Know why?
because I sent them! - You can't stop lying, can you?
I can't stop lying? They're coming up the stairs.
they're coming to get you. Look around.
that room's getting smaller every second.
inch by inch! You know what?
it's not gonna be any bigger than this fucking goddamn booth!
they're in position, in position. - Get them to move!
there's nobody there. - There's nobody there?
they're coming through that fucking door to put you out of your misery.
you got a couple seconds left. What're you gonna do?
if this is true, I have to take someone with me, don't I?
since Kelly is the most important thing in your life, I'll take her.
then take me! Take me. This is about me!
I'm the fucking one you want! Take me!
this is about me! Come on!
take me! It's me you want!
this is Captain Ramey. Somebody talk to me.
we're too late. The psycho heard us coming...
...and slashed his throat with a knife.
what's his condition? - Critical. He's lost a lot of blood.
get him down here. I don't want nobody dying on me.
all right.
Kelly, where's Kelly? - Your wife's fine, all right?
all right, try not to sit up.
what hit me? - Rubber bullet.
figured if somebody's gonna shoot you, it might as well be us.
Thanks.
did you get him? - You did.
I didn't do anything. - Give yourself some credit.
got yourself out alive. Doesn't always happen that way.
are you okay? - It's okay. I'm okay.
God. I was so afraid.
I thought I wasn't ever gonna see you again.
me too.
we've got things to talk about.
I only want to talk about what you want to tell me.
I want to tell you everything. Everything.
get that gurney over here. Get over here.
we lost him.
I want to stand up. - I got him.
sure you can hold on? - I gotta see him.
you don't want to see this. - Yes, I do.
take it easy. - Yes, I do.
allow me. Allow me. - Go ahead.
you recognize him?
Yeah. He was down here trying to deliver me a pizza...
...10 minutes before I got the call.
I told him to fuck off.
that's enough these days.
just give it a minute.
we'll be driving, and you'll be flying.
whatever you say.
what a piece of shit.
nice shoes.
Italian.
you hung up, Stu.
I didn't get a chance to say goodbye.
I feel bad about the pizza guy.
but I couldn't miss seeing you and Kelly reunited.
you don't have to thank me. Nobody ever does.
I just hope your newfound honesty lasts.
because it if doesn't, you'll be hearing from me.
isn't it funny?
you hear a phone ring, and it could be anybody.
but a ringing phone has to be answered, doesn't it?
doesn't it?
Hello?
say it!
say it or I will blow him away!
so do you whack off now? - Hey!
I'm gonna see about that lawyer for you, okay?
Yes. - Just relax.
Stu, I think you hurt his feelings. - I wanna know who's on that phone.
I want a techie here. I need to talk to somebody about that phone.
do you think we went too far, Stuart? Should we give ourselves up?
maybe I'd like someone to negotiate my surrender.
I'm sure we can work that out. - I won't just spill my guts to anyone.
could you get me national news? I mean, you've got connections, right?
sure. - Could you get Larry King down here?
why the fuck would Larry King come here?
because you're friends. Who else could you get, huh?
could you get Tom Brokaw? How about Dan Rather? Diane Sawyer?
how about Mike Wallace? Ted Koppel? Peter Jennings? Katie Couric?
al Roker? Anybody? No! Nobody.
face it, Stu, you're smalltime. And you've got a credibility problem.
don't fucking worry about my credibility! All right?
what about yours?
look, it's our friends from channels two and five. Your local news, Stuart.
you couldn't do this for your clients if your life depended on it.
but me, I've made you famous.
stick your head out so they can get a better angle on you.
they're here to cover me dying. - How ungrateful.
those cameras will make the police very careful.
so come on, smile a little for them. - Can you tap into that phone call?
should be no problem. - Except we'll need a warrant if he's on the line with his shrink.
fuck that. I'm not gonna jeopardize this on a technicality.
look, tracing, that's not a violation, right?
as long as we don't listen in. - Okay, this is what I want you to do.
I want you to find who he's talking to and their current location.
all right? We get that?
I want somebody to find out what's going on.
look across the street and see what everybody in New York is looking at.
you're the man, Stuart. You're the center of attention.
wait till this goes national: ABC, CBS, CNN, UPN...
you're gonna hit the whole alphabet, Stu.
I'll be forgotten about in a week.
no one ever remembers the names of the victims.
it's the killers that get the cover of Time magazine. Right?
think about it. You'd be famous. Ted Bundy, John Wayne Gacy...
...fucking Jeffrey Dahmer. Name a victim. You can't.
anyway, I don't deserve to be the center of attention.
it ought to be you they're covering. - That attention would embarrass me.
I know exactly the spin to put on this. - How terror inspires your creativity?
listen, this could be a media frenzy, all right? You'd get Barbara Walters...
...I mean, Larry King if you still wanted him.
that approach seems predicated upon me surrendering without killing you.
listen, we can make you sympathetic, sit with a writer, bang out a book.
you know, movie of the week. Get America on your side.
all right, you killed Leon because he was gonna kill me.
you killed Leon to protect me. All right?
in a city where nobody looks out for anybody, you took a stand.
I'm your best witness.
so you want me to trust you to get me out of this?
Yes, I do. I want you to trust me. Trust me.
Stu, you must think I'm crazy.
Oh, shit. Here comes Braman. - I'll take care of him.
Hey. Should've waited for me to initiate contact with the suspect.
I established a rapport. Let you know if I need help.
are you grandstanding for TV cameras?
or do you want to leave this to a professional?
until a professional gets here, I'll handle it.
you're a funny guy. All right, you get somebody else killed, it's on your head.
got it?
this is what I want to do, okay? This is the City Hotel here.
I want three guys in the lobby here. And five sharpshooters up here.
see if you can get me two in the subway.
what the fuck?
not going to answer it? - I can't. I can't reach for the phone.
the cops will think it's a gun. - I'll bet it's Kelly.
she's probably heard what you did. She's sick with worry.
I'm not gonna make her feel any better, am I?
well, you could ask her to forgive you, Stuart.
you could confess your sins and beg for absolution, come clean.
you're in this position because you're not telling the truth.
I'm in this position because you got a gun!
no. Stuart, that is the sin of spin. Avoidance and deception.
you're being given a chance here to make things right. Now, talk to her.
look, I can't. Please. - I am telling you to answer that phone!
excuse me! Excuse me! - You can't cross in front of here!
answer it!
look, I can't. Please. - Don't make me hurt you!
talk to your wife! - It's not her calling.
how can you be so sure? - It's you. It's you, you miserable fuck!
damn, you got me! You continue to impress.
you could shoot me, but you want them to do it!
Yes, well, that's an option. - Yeah.
captain. - Yeah?
this lady says the perp's her husband. Here's her ID.
I couldn't believe when I saw this. - Who do you think he's talking to?
I don't know. I spoke to him earlier today and I told him that there was a man who called me.
a man?
did this upset him, that you were talking to other men?
Yes, he did seem a little upset, but it's, no... It's not like that.
I didn't even know who this guy was. - Who's his psychiatrist?
he doesn't have one. - That you know of.
I've been with him three years, married for one. I'd know if he was in therapy.
I wish to God he had been. I saw somebody after my divorce.
it kept me from picking up a gun, doing something I would regret.
look, Stu didn't kill anyone. - Ma'am, under the circumstances...
...you need to consider whether your husband is who you thought he was.
cause according to these witnesses over here, he has a gun...
...he has used that gun and let's pray to God that he doesn't use it again.
captain?
if you can think of any dispute he's having currently, please, tell me.
we're clearing City Hotel. I can stage an assault unit within feet of the booth.
we've also got sharpshooters securing rooftop positions.
let me know when you're in position. - Absolutely.
what about that wire tap?
we're working on it. You gotta hold tight a while, all right?
Yeah, no problem. No problem. - Okay.
Mrs. Shepard. Mrs. Shepard.
does he like being called Stuart or Stu? - Stu. Call him Stu.
Stu. Okay.
come with me, please.
Stu.
I have your wife with me.
that's how you knew she wasn't calling. You deceived me.
Stu! - She's not my wife.
are you okay?
can you just talk to me? - Yes, talk to her, Stu.
look, she's not my wife!
she's some fucked-up, failed actress I wouldn't handle. She's stalking me!
you aren't making this up? You are his wife, right?
Yes, here's a photograph of us together.
I don't know what he's talking about.
Stu. Listen to your wife.
she only wants what's best for you. - She's not my wife!
Stu, nobody wants to hurt you.
we just want to know what happened. - Yeah, very good.
go home, you fucking lunatic! You hear me? Go home!
please don't make things worse. Just come out.
just do what they tell you to do.
your wife is a crazy actress stalker and you don't know her.
that's an interesting match. - Get her out of here!
enough. I don't want to agitate this. - You out of your fucking mind?
come on, get the woman out of here! - No. I don't know what's going on.
he's bleeding... We... We're fine. This morning everything was fine.
you just stay here. Just stay here, okay?
okay. - I think she did some good.
you got a number of that lawyer? - No, we don't have a lawyer.
he asked for his lawyer to come negotiate his surrender.
well, we never needed one. - Well, you need a good one now.
look, you'll do me best by staying near here. Okay?
I'm gonna get your husband out alive.
I'm not going to let you fuck this up! - Get Mrs. Shepard out of here.
you know, get her some coffee or something.
you're gonna lose this guy. You need some kind of redemption.
what are you seeing a shrink for? - Get the fuck out of my face!
don't fucking touch me! - I'm not stepping down!
you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
you'd think she didn't know she was being watched.
what? - But beautiful women always know.
you talking about Kelly? - That false indifference, superior air...
...It's just a tease. They want eyes on them.
why does she put on her makeup, do her hair, dress so nicely?
not for her husband that she hardly ever sees.
no, it's for somebody else to notice. I notice.
what are you doing? Stay away from her. Leave her alone.
I'm giving her what she wants.
I bet you've never looked at Kelly the way I am right now.
don't you dare fucking hurt her. - Don't I dare?
I'm not the one who has hurt her, Stuart.
what they can't know is what we do to them in our minds. Right?
you sick fuck! - The perfect violation.
leave her out of this. - How many times...
...have you had sex with Pam in that hotel bedroom in your head?
would you really miss Kelly if she was gone?
that's it. Not another word. I'm not talking to you.
your choices put other people in jeopardy.
when are you gonna learn that?
this is funny. Stuart, look uptown.
these geniuses are still at the juncture box trying to tap in.
only I have installed an encryption device at both ends of the line.
there's no chance of a trap trace...
...so now they've gotta try some fancy LoJack instrument. It's really sad.
I hope you weren't pinning your hopes on those morons.
truth is, I'm on a wireless A. D.S. with a cloned number.
it'll take a half an hour to find out I call forwarded through Philadelphia.
and let me tell you, this will all be over before they can get a dial tone.
we can't get a trace or break into the line. It's like a ball of rubber bands.
I knew there was something weird about this. You keep working on it.
Stu. Stuart, come on, you're behaving like a child.
still gonna give me the silent treatment?
hello. Stuart, don't do this, please. Come on.
my sainted mother used to do this. She used to dish this out.
Stuart, please don't do this.
Stuart, you're bringing back my unhappy childhood.
Stuart, talk to me! Please, talk to me! I can't take it! Stu, please...
I'm kidding. I had a very happy childhood.
Hey, there's our girl again. I wasn't planning on killing her...
...but plans change.
just tell me what the fuck you want from me.
hello. There you are. I thought I was talking to myself again.
anything you want. I'll do it. Just tell me.
tell Kelly about the real Stu, about your little motel.
and then you'll let us go? - Why not?
Kelly! - That's a start.
baby! - Hold her back!
Hey! - Talk to me!
grab her! Keep her back! - Yes?
I'm listening.
Kelly, I called some woman.
every day. - Every day.
I was attracted to this other woman. And I called her and...
I wanted to fuck her. - And I wanted to sleep with her.
no. I wanted to fuck her.
say it. Say it! - And I wanted to fuck her.
I'm sorry. - Whatever you did, I don't care.
please, just come out of the booth. Okay?
that's all I did. That's all I did. I'm sorry.
all right, I've done what you asked. That's it. I've had enough of this.
I haven't.
you said you'd let us go. - I changed my mind.
you miserable fuck. You can't do this. You can't do this to me.
look, I took all your shit. I did everything you fucking asked.
you lied to me. I'm done with this.
I've fucking had enough. You can go fuck yourself! Later.
he hung up. - Maybe they already got a trace.
ESU, ESU?
I'm giving myself up! - He's coming out!
heads up! - I want to see you toss away your weapon!
throw the weapon outside the booth! Stay where you are!
first, the weapon! - Don't hurt him! Please, don't hurt him!
there's no fucking gun! - Stay right where you are!
I want you to turn around. Interlock your fingers behind your head. Okay?
please give them the gun! - Kelly, no!
get back! Kelly!
Freeze! - Get back! Get back!
get back! - Okay! Okay!
I gotta answer it.
Freeze! Don't move.
hold your fire!
hold your fire!
hold your fire.
hold. Hold. - Please.
go ahead. Answer it. - What the fuck are you doing?
he's coming out!
answer the phone.
you fucking coward. - Hi, Stu.
now, you've had your little tantrum and you said some things in anger that I am willing to forget.
get her back in the car! I want her in the car.
if he's not the shooter, then who the fuck is?
captain, what the fuck is up with the phone calls?
so can we start over? - You lied.
you can't know the pain of betrayal until you've been betrayed.
sniper in one of these buildings. I want you to talk to ESU.
I want you to get one of these guys, this building.
start looking up there from window to window till you find the perp. Okay?
I want you to do it quickly, and I want you to do it quietly. All right?
Where's the ESU sergeant?
you said we could go.
you said you'd let us go. - Relax, Stuart.
nobody gets it right the first time.
you've done better than others. You will get a chance to end this.
I'm just not finished yet. - Yeah, well, I am.
there's nothing keeping me. - Besides the fear of death?
I dive out and you've got one shot. I'm gonna be dancing.
you think you can get me? - I could go for some target practice.
one shot, they look for you. Second shot, you give yourself away.
go on, Stuart, hang up!
trust your fate to friendly men in flak jackets with automatic weapons.
I'm sure you can patch up that little misunderstanding about the dead body.
cops can't prove I killed anyone. - You had motive.
no weapon. - Plenty of loudmouth witnesses.
no gun and I walk.
are you sure? - Yes!
yeah? You murder a guy and you forget where you stashed your gun?
why don't you lift the plastic ceiling panel and feel around?
Peekaboo!
what's up next to the florescent bulb? Check it out, Stu.
cops see me reach for something, they'll blow me away.
there's only one way to find out.
look, the slugs in that dead guy, they came from your rifle.
hollow points fragment on impact, Stuart. There's nothing to match.
only there's no gun up there. - Don't take my word for it.
see for yourself. There are rounds left in it.
I totally couldn't give a shit. - Come on. Don't disappoint me.
use your imagination. You'd shoot me if you got the chance, wouldn't you?
with a big fucking smile on my face.
there's the spirit.
now, what if I told you I was just above the theater, four floors up?
see the pink curtains?
there you go, Stuart. Yes.
Yoo-hoo!
Yoo-hoo!
why would you do that?
because it's fun. The odds are even now, Stuart.
isn't that what you wanted?
you know where I am, and you have a gun.
if you have it in you, you can take me down.
fuck!
they'd kill me before I got a shot. - Oh, you're probably right.
I'm not really there anyway.
you would've just spoiled some nice lady's curtains.
looks like someone watches the news.
who? - The motel.
Oh, God. - I think she could use a new headshot.
don't! - Then take down the gun.
look, this has nothing to do with her! - She has everything to do with this.
you're here and she's here because you called her.
now, take it down! Don't make me hurt Pam, Stuart.
take down the gun! - Hey, everybody, get ready.
hold on, hold on. Let's just see what he does, all right?
let's see what he's doing.
there's nothing there.
nothing but your fingerprints on the finest cop killer money can buy.
come on, Stu. Let's see it. - Fuck, no! It's staying there.
fine, then someone will have to take your place.
come on, Stu, you're in a perfect position.
how do you figure? - You get to choose between them.
Pamela or Kelly? Should I choose? One of them can take your place.
don't do this!
you've got to be more in touch with your feelings. I thought you only loved Kelly!
it's true! - But you lie to her.
it's complicated.
then I'll uncomplicate it, Stuart, by removing temptation. I say Pam.
No! Look, this isn't Pam's fault. This is all my fault!
she's innocent!
Ticktock, ticktock. Time's running out. Okay, Kelly, then.
you decide. - No, please!
come on, Stu. Don't you get the game yet?
you're a selfish guy. Pick one and save yourself.
blond or brunette? Time's running out.
you or them? Kelly or Pam? Kelly or Pam?
come on, Stu!
stop this.
I can't take this anymore. - What are you doing? Get up!
I was looking for my ring. Look... - Get up, Stuart!
stand up and be a man. You're embarrassing yourself.
captain! I got it. Listen.
the rifleman reports subject pulled a small, dark object out of his pocket.
all right. You're looking at a suicide on national fucking TV.
you gonna let me take this over?
tell everybody to hold on, to hold their fire.
everybody hold. Stay ready, but hold.
Stuart, you're beginning to annoy me. - You can't do this.
Stu. No more spinning, no more excuses.
What're you doing? Look, listen. Listen, please listen to me.
no more delays, Stuart.
look... I'm on my knees begging you not to kill me.
I will if you keep up this pathetic spectacle.
excuse me! He's on the phone, talking.
from up in your high window, you could kill anyone.
Yes, I know that, Stuart. - All right, and...
you could pick off any of the cops, with your rifle.
shut up and stand up!
look, why threaten Kelly?
you liked how she sounded on the phone at the store.
please don't hurt her. Don't fucking hurt my wife.
this doesn't have to end with me shooting you. You leave no choice.
now, get up! - All right.
okay, how does this end? Tell me how this ends.
the stage is almost set.
people are gonna be eating dinner watching you die.
we got a sniper situation here.
what about that phone call to your store?
I got a phone call this afternoon. I think it was a prank call.
he told me Stu would be calling me from a phone booth.
how long will it take to get a record of her calls?
if he's using that secure line, we won't know more than now.
say he didn't. Let's assume he's a human, makes mistakes like all of us.
I need to get that number. I've been waiting for that number.
it was a guy. He sounded like mid-30s.
Mrs. Shepard? It would be safer if you got back in the car, okay?
please get back in the car. - Thank you.
I want you to divert incoming ESU units to Broadway and hold them there.
want me to clear the streets? - Yeah.
no, no, no. I don't want the sniper to be aware of any of our movements.
he's already got position on us.
let's not let him know we know too much, okay?
Hey, Jonah. - Yeah.
don't look up.
get me sharpshooters looking at those windows.
you got it, captain. - I'm gonna buy us some time here.
all right.
Stu! It's okay if I come out and talk to you for a second?
I don't know. - This guy is so lonely.
all he wants to do is talk. - You're walking through a bad dream...
...and you can't wake up. - Now he's really testing my patience.
you wanna wake up, Stu?
I wanna, but I got issues I can't talk about.
that your psychiatrist on the phone? - Yeah, yeah. I'm paying him overtime.
that was pretty brave what you did.
I mean, admitting all that stuff to your wife.
it was liberating, right? - Should've been.
maybe if I could be more honest with my wife then...
...I don't know, something would've turned out different.
Oh, please.
trust is the key. You trust me, Stu? - Get this man a seat on Oprah.
I wanna, but I got the issues I can't talk about.
Yes, lethal issues. Tell him to stay back.
look, don't come any closer.
Hey, I don't wanna cause or make anything harder for you.
Pam, Ramey, Kelly, people on the street, you've got lives in your hands.
I told you it's a private conversation. What the fuck do you want?
I wanna let you know that it's safe outside the booth.
it's not. - It's always, "Get out of the booth!"
I like it in the fucking booth! All right? It's my world.
this is my booth, and I'm not coming out. All right?
never. - We're not gonna force you out...
...because there could be some miscalculation...
...and then I would never find out why this happened.
Stu, I'm afraid. I'm afraid that I'm gonna be standing by...
...and my men are gonna shoot some guy...
...and when we find out what's in his hand, once we turn over his body...
...and we see what he was threatening people with...
we realize that it was just a little black Bible.
or a cell phone. - Don't push me, Stu.
I'm not gonna let that happen here.
I wanted to make a phone call. One lousy call...
that's enough, Stu.
you got some bad news on that call? - The worst.
I bet you want to jump off the edge.
I've been falling ever since. - I'm gonna push him over the edge.
just say the word.
it's time to land.
when you hit bottom, you die. - I'm your safety net.
Oh, please, say the word.
if I tell you what you wanna know, you'll die too.
exactly.
I'm going. - Good.
but, Stu, we put a call out to your lawyer.
your wife, she gave us the number.
and I got my best men working on bringing him down. Okay?
that's it. The captain gets a bullet.
get out of here! Hear what I said, asshole?
get out of here, go on, now! Go! - Enough of this sideshow, Stu.
your sins have caught up to you. - So this is all some religious thing?
that explains it. Bible-crazed killer picks on fashion-obsessed PR guy.
tell me what you want, then. - What everyone wants for the bad guy to get what he deserves.
go for the gun.
kill myself? - Yes.
it would be a rare, unselfish act.
we got hostile action. - Nothing is hostile until I say it is.
look, I can't find it. - Kelly, Pam, bam! Bam!
all right! Look, I found it. I got it.
then let's see it. Let everyone see it. - The cops'll kill me.
Yes. You're talking prime-time material now.
all this shit just to watch me die? - No.
to get you to do what's right. If you wanna save yourself, confess.
I already told Kelly everything. - Everything?
no. No more excuses and half-truths, Stuart.
you look out into those cameras and you bare your soul.
TV seems to help bring out the worst in people.
you should be fine.
How're those techs doing? Anything? - No, not yet. Not yet.
we haven't found your lawyer yet, Stu. But we're getting close. Okay?
Stuart, I'm offering you a chance to redeem yourself.
come on, humble yourself in front of your loved ones...
...and millions of strangers and me. It's do-or-die time.
what, you couldn't find anyone worse than me?
not a murderer or a child molester but a publicist...
...who has fantasies about pretty little actresses.
who spends money on Italian suits and dry cleaning...
...so people think he's important. Who doesn't waste time being nice...
...to people who are of no use to him. These are my crimes?
Stuart, I know your crimes. Tell them.
I've never done anything for anybody...
...who couldn't do something for me. I string along a kid with promises that I'll pay him money.
I keep him around because he looks up to me.
Adam, if you're watching, don't be a publicist. You're too good for it.
I lie to newspapers and magazines who sell my lies to more and more people.
I'm just a part of a big cycle of lies. I should be fucking president.
I wear all this Italian shit because underneath, I still feel like the Bronx.
I think I need these clothes, and this watch.
my $2000 watch is a fake, and so am I.
I neglected the things I should've valued most.
I valued this shit.
I take off my wedding ring to call Pam. Kelly, that's Pam.
somebody got a 20 on this Pam? - Don't blame her.
I never told her if I was married, and if I did...
...she would've told me to go home.
Kelly, looking at you now, I'm ashamed of myself.
I mean, I work so hard on this image, on Stu Shepard, the asshole...
...who refers to himself in third person, that I only proved I should be alone.
I've been dressing up as something I'm not for so long...
...l'm so afraid you won't like what's underneath.
but here I am. I'm just flesh and blood and weakness.
I love you so fucking much.
I take off this ring because it only reminds me of how I've failed you.
and, I don't wanna give you up.
I wanna make things better, but it may not be my choice anymore.
you deserve better.
you're not gonna let me go. - No.
you never were. I know a thing about lies.
I know a thing or two about liars as well.
then why the confession?
I didn't do it for you.
right there. - Yeah, got that.
captain, captain. The call to his wife originated at 2: 17 at a hard line from the old Barkley Hotel.
you got a room? - 604.
second window from the corner. ESU units holding.
cover the windows, doors, fire escape, every goddamn point of exit.
ESU, ESU, come in from the 52nd... - Stu!
your lawyer's coming down now! - Doors, fire escapes...
now!
at least you'll die with a clean conscience.
no, you're the one that's gonna die! Listen, you can hear them now.
they're coming to get you. Know why?
because I sent them! - You can't stop lying, can you?
I can't stop lying? They're coming up the stairs.
they're coming to get you. Look around.
that room's getting smaller every second.
inch by inch! You know what?
it's not gonna be any bigger than this fucking goddamn booth!
they're in position, in position. - Get them to move!
there's nobody there. - There's nobody there?
they're coming through that fucking door to put you out of your misery.
you got a couple seconds left. What're you gonna do?
if this is true, I have to take someone with me, don't I?
since Kelly is the most important thing in your life, I'll take her.
then take me! Take me. This is about me!
I'm the fucking one you want! Take me!
this is about me! Come on!
take me! It's me you want!
this is Captain Ramey. Somebody talk to me.
we're too late. The psycho heard us coming...
...and slashed his throat with a knife.
what's his condition? - Critical. He's lost a lot of blood.
get him down here. I don't want nobody dying on me.
all right.
Kelly, where's Kelly? - Your wife's fine, all right?
all right, try not to sit up.
what hit me? - Rubber bullet.
figured if somebody's gonna shoot you, it might as well be us.
Thanks.
did you get him? - You did.
I didn't do anything. - Give yourself some credit.
got yourself out alive. Doesn't always happen that way.
are you okay? - It's okay. I'm okay.
God. I was so afraid.
I thought I wasn't ever gonna see you again.
me too.
we've got things to talk about.
I only want to talk about what you want to tell me.
I want to tell you everything. Everything.
get that gurney over here. Get over here.
we lost him.
I want to stand up. - I got him.
sure you can hold on? - I gotta see him.
you don't want to see this. - Yes, I do.
take it easy. - Yes, I do.
allow me. Allow me. - Go ahead.
you recognize him?
Yeah. He was down here trying to deliver me a pizza 10 minutes before I got the call.
I told him to fuck off.
that's enough these days.
just give it a minute.
we'll be driving, and you'll be flying.
whatever you say.
what a piece of shit.
nice shoes.
Italian.
you hung up, Stu.
I didn't get a chance to say goodbye.
I feel bad about the pizza guy.
but I couldn't miss seeing you and Kelly reunited.
you don't have to thank me. Nobody ever does.
I just hope your newfound honesty lasts.
because it if doesn't, you'll be hearing from me.
isn't it funny?
you hear a phone ring, and it could be anybody.
but a ringing phone has to be answered, doesn't it?
doesn't it?
Hello?
say it!
say it or I will blow him away!
so do you whack off now? - Hey!
I'm gonna see about that lawyer for you, okay?
Yes. - Just relax.
Stu, I think you hurt his feelings. - I wanna know who's on that phone.
I want a techie here. I need to talk to somebody about that phone.
do you think we went too far, Stuart? Should we give ourselves up?
maybe I'd like someone to negotiate my surrender.
I'm sure we can work that out. - I won't just spill my guts to anyone.
could you get me national news? I mean, you've got connections, right?
sure. - Could you get Larry King down here?
why the fuck would Larry King come here?
because you're friends. Who else could you get, huh?
could you get Tom Brokaw? How about Dan Rather? Diane Sawyer?
look, I, I, I don't know. They're busy. - I, I, I busy.
how about Mike Wallace? Ted Koppel? Peter Jennings? Katie Couric?
al Roker? Anybody? No! Nobody.
face it, Stu, you're smalltime. And you've got a credibility problem.
don't fucking worry about my credibility! All right?
what about yours?
look, it's our friends from channels two and five. Your local news, Stuart.
you couldn't do this for your clients if your life depended on it.
but me, I've made you famous.
stick your head out so they can get a better angle on you.
they're here to cover me dying. - How ungrateful.
those cameras will make the police very careful.
so come on, smile a little for them. - Can you tap into that phone call?
should be no problem. - Except...
...We'll need a warrant if he's on the line with his shrink.
fuck that. I'm not gonna jeopardize this on a technicality.
look, tracing, that's not a violation, right?
as long as we don't listen in. - Okay, this is what I want you to do.
I want you to find who he's talking to and their current location.
all right? We get that?
I want somebody to find out what's going on.
look across the street and see what everybody in New York is looking at.
you're the man, Stuart. You're the center of attention.
wait till this goes national: ABC, CBS, CNN, UPN...
you're gonna hit the whole alphabet, Stu.
I'll be forgotten about in a week.
no one ever remembers the names of the victims.
it's the killers that get the cover of Time magazine. Right?
think about it. You'd be famous. Ted Bundy, John Wayne Gacy...
...fucking Jeffrey Dahmer. Name a victim. You can't.
anyway, I don't deserve to be the center of attention.
it ought to be you they're covering. - That attention would embarrass me.
I know exactly the spin to put on this. - How terror inspires your creativity?
listen, this could be a media frenzy, all right? You'd get Barbara Walters...
...I mean, Larry King if you still wanted him.
that approach seems predicated upon me surrendering without killing you.
listen, we can make you sympathetic, sit with a writer, bang out a book.
you know, movie of the week. Get America on your side.
all right, you killed Leon because he was gonna kill me.
you killed Leon to protect me. All right?
in a city where nobody looks out for anybody, you took a stand.
I'm your best witness.
so you want me to trust you to get me out of this?
Yes, I do. I want you to trust me. Trust me.
Stu, you must think I'm crazy.
Oh, shit. Here comes Braman. - I'll take care of him.
Hey. Should've waited for me to initiate contact with the suspect.
I established a rapport. Let you know if I need help.
are you grandstanding for TV cameras?
or do you want to leave this to a professional?
until a professional gets here, I'll handle it.
you're a funny guy. All right, you get somebody else killed, it's on your head.
got it?
this is what I want to do, okay? This is the City Hotel here.
I want three guys in the lobby here. And five sharpshooters up here.
see if you can get me two in the subway.
what the fuck?
not going to answer it? - I can't. I can't reach for the phone.
the cops will think it's a gun. - I'll bet it's Kelly.
she's probably heard what you did. She's sick with worry.
I'm not gonna make her feel any better, am I?
well, you could ask her to forgive you, Stuart.
you could confess your sins and beg for absolution, come clean.
you're in this position because you're not telling the truth.
I'm in this position because you got a gun!
no. Stuart, that is the sin of spin. Avoidance and deception.
you're being given a chance here to make things right. Now, talk to her.
look, I can't. Please. - I am telling you to answer that phone!
excuse me! Excuse me! - You can't cross in front of here!
answer it!
look, I can't. Please. - Don't make me hurt you!
talk to your wife! - It's not her calling.
how can you be so sure? - It's you. It's you, you miserable fuck!
damn, you got me! You continue to impress.
you could shoot me, but you want them to do it!
Yes, well, that's an option. - Yeah.
captain. - Yeah?
this lady says the perp's her husband. Here's her ID.
I couldn't believe when I saw this. - Who do you think he's talking to?
I don't know. I spoke to him earlier today and I told him...
...that there was a man who called me. - A man?
did this upset him, that you were talking to other men?
Yes, he did seem a little upset, but it's, no... It's not like that.
I didn't even know who this guy was. - Who's his psychiatrist?
he doesn't have one. - That you know of.
I've been with him three years, married for one. I'd know if he was in therapy.
I wish to God he had been. I saw somebody after my divorce.
it kept me from picking up a gun, doing something I would regret.
look, Stu didn't kill anyone. - Ma'am, under the circumstances...
...you need to consider whether your husband is who you thought he was.
cause according to these witnesses over here, he has a gun...
...he has used that gun and let's pray to God that he doesn't use it again.
captain?
if you can think of any dispute he's having currently, please, tell me.
we're clearing City Hotel. I can stage an assault unit within feet of the booth.
we've also got sharpshooters securing rooftop positions.
let me know when you're in position. - Absolutely.
what about that wire tap?
we're working on it. You gotta hold tight a while, all right?
Yeah, no problem. No problem. - Okay.
Mrs. Shepard. Mrs. Shepard.
does he like being called Stuart or Stu? - Stu. Call him Stu.
Stu. Okay.
come with me, please.
Stu.
I have your wife with me.
that's how you knew she wasn't calling. You deceived me.
Stu! - She's not my wife.
are you okay?
can you just talk to me? - Yes, talk to her, Stu.
look, she's not my wife!
she's some fucked-up, failed actress I wouldn't handle. She's stalking me!
you aren't making this up? You are his wife, right?
Yes, here's a photograph of us together.
I don't know what he's talking about.
Stu. Listen to your wife.
she only wants what's best for you. - She's not my wife!
Stu, nobody wants to hurt you.
we just want to know what happened. - Yeah, very good.
go home, you fucking lunatic! You hear me? Go home!
please don't make things worse. Just come out.
just do what they tell you to do.
your wife is a crazy actress stalker and you don't know her.
that's an interesting match. - Get her out of here!
enough. I don't want to agitate this. - You out of your fucking mind?
come on, get the woman out of here! - No. I don't know what's going on.
he's bleeding... We... We're fine. This morning everything was fine.
you just stay here. Just stay here, okay?
okay. - I think she did some good.
you got a number of that lawyer? - No, we don't have a lawyer.
he asked for his lawyer to come negotiate his surrender.
well, we never needed one. - Well, you need a good one now.
look, you'll do me best by staying near here. Okay?
I'm gonna get your husband out alive.
I'm not going to let you fuck this up! - Get Mrs. Shepard out of here.
you know, get her some coffee or something.
you're gonna lose this guy. You need some kind of redemption.
what are you seeing a shrink for? - Get the fuck out of my face!
don't fucking touch me! - I'm not stepping down!
you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
you'd think she didn't know she was being watched.
what? - But beautiful women always know.
you talking about Kelly? - That false indifference, superior air...
...It's just a tease. They want eyes on them.
why does she put on her makeup, do her hair, dress so nicely?
not for her husband that she hardly ever sees.
no, it's for somebody else to notice. I notice.
what are you doing? Stay away from her. Leave her alone.
I'm giving her what she wants.
I bet you've never looked at Kelly the way I am right now.
don't you dare fucking hurt her. - Don't I dare?
I'm not the one who has hurt her, Stuart.
what they can't know is what we do to them in our minds. Right?
you sick fuck! - The perfect violation.
leave her out of this. - How many times...
...have you had sex with Pam in that hotel bedroom in your head?
would you really miss Kelly if she was gone?
that's it. Not another word. I'm not talking to you.
your choices put other people in jeopardy.
when are you gonna learn that?
this is funny. Stuart, look uptown.
these geniuses are still at the juncture box trying to tap in.
only I have installed an encryption device at both ends of the line.
there's no chance of a trap trace...
...so now they've gotta try some fancy LoJack instrument. It's really sad.
I hope you weren't pinning your hopes on those morons.
truth is, I'm on a wireless A. D.S. With a cloned number.
it'll take a half an hour to find out I call forwarded through Philadelphia.
and let me tell you, this will all be over before they can get a dial tone.
we can't get a trace or break into the line. It's like a ball of rubber bands.
I knew there was something weird about this. You keep working on it.
Stu. Stuart, come on, you're behaving like a child.
still gonna give me the silent treatment?
hello. Stuart, don't do this, please. Come on.
my sainted mother used to do this. She used to dish this out.
Stuart, please don't do this.
Stuart, you're bringing back my unhappy childhood.
Stuart, talk to me! Please, talk to me! I can't take it! Stu, please...
I'm kidding. I had a very happy childhood.
Hey, there's our girl again. I wasn't planning on killing her...
...but plans change.
just tell me what the fuck you want from me.
hello. There you are. I thought I was talking to myself again.
anything you want. I'll do it. Just tell me.
tell Kelly about the real Stu, about your little motel.
and then you'll let us go? - Why not?
Kelly! - That's a start.
baby! - Hold her back!
Hey! - Talk to me!
grab her! Keep her back! - Yes?
I'm listening.
Kelly, I called some woman.
every day. - Every day.
I was attracted to this other woman. And I called her and...
I wanted to fuck her. - And I wanted to sleep with her.
no. I wanted to fuck her.
say it. Say it! - And I wanted to fuck her.
I'm sorry. - Whatever you did, I don't care.
please, just come out of the booth. Okay?
that's all I did. That's all I did. I'm sorry.
all right, I've done what you asked. That's it. I've had enough of this.
I haven't.
you said you'd let us go. - I changed my mind.
you miserable fuck. You can't do this. You can't do this to me.
look, I took all your shit. I did everything you fucking asked.
you lied to me. I'm done with this.
I've fucking had enough. You can go fuck yourself! Later.
he hung up. - Maybe they already got a trace.
ESU, ESU?
I'm giving myself up! - He's coming out!
heads up! - I want to see you toss away your weapon!
throw the weapon outside the booth! Stay where you are!
first, the weapon! - Don't hurt him! Please, don't hurt him!
there's no fucking gun! - Stay right where you are!
I want you to turn around. Interlock your fingers behind your head. Okay?
please give them the gun! - Kelly, no!
get back! Kelly!
Freeze! - Get back! Get back!
get back! - Okay! Okay!
I gotta answer it.
Freeze! Don't move.
hold your fire!
hold your fire!
hold your fire.
hold. Hold. - Please.
go ahead. Answer it. - What the fuck are you doing?
he's coming out!
answer the phone.
you fucking coward. - Hi, Stu.
now, you've had your little tantrum and you said some things in anger...
...that I am willing to forget.
get her back in the car! I want her in the car.
if he's not the shooter, then who the fuck is?
captain, what the fuck is up with the phone calls?
so can we start over? - You lied.
you can't know the pain of betrayal until you've been betrayed.
sniper in one of these buildings. I want you to talk to ESU.
I want you to get one of these guys, this building.
start looking up there from window to window till you find the perp. Okay?
I want you to do it quickly, and I want you to do it quietly. All right?
Where's the ESU sergeant?
you said we could go.
you said you'd let us go. - Relax, Stuart.
nobody gets it right the first time.
you've done better than others. You will get a chance to end this.
I'm just not finished yet. - Yeah, well, I am.
there's nothing keeping me. - Besides the fear of death?
I dive out and you've got one shot. I'm gonna be dancing.
you think you can get me? - I could go for some target practice.
one shot, they look for you. Second shot, you give yourself away.
go on, Stuart, hang up!
trust your fate to friendly men in flak jackets with automatic weapons.
I'm sure you can patch up that little misunderstanding about the dead body.
cops can't prove I killed anyone. - You had motive.
no weapon. - Plenty of loudmouth witnesses.
no gun and I walk.
are you sure? - Yes!
yeah? You murder a guy and you forget where you stashed your gun?
why don't you lift the plastic ceiling panel and feel around?
Peekaboo!
what's up next to the florescent bulb? Check it out, Stu.
cops see me reach for something, they'll blow me away.
there's only one way to find out.
look, the slugs in that dead guy, they came from your rifle.
hollow points fragment on impact, Stuart. There's nothing to match.
only there's no gun up there. - Don't take my word for it.
see for yourself. There are rounds left in it.
I totally couldn't give a shit. - Come on. Don't disappoint me.
use your imagination. You'd shoot me if you got the chance, wouldn't you?
with a big fucking smile on my face.
there's the spirit.
now, what if I told you I was just above the theater, four floors up?
see the pink curtains?
there you go, Stuart. Yes.
Yoo-hoo!
Yoo-hoo!
why would you do that?
because it's fun. The odds are even now, Stuart.
isn't that what you wanted?
you know where I am, and you have a gun.
if you have it in you, you can take me down.
fuck!
they'd kill me before I got a shot. - Oh, you're probably right.
I'm not really there anyway.
you would've just spoiled some nice lady's curtains.
looks like someone watches the news.
who? - The motel.
Oh, God. - I think she could use a new headshot.
don't! - Then take down the gun.
look, this has nothing to do with her! - She has everything to do with this.
you're here and she's here because you called her.
now, take it down! Don't make me hurt Pam, Stuart.
take down the gun! - Hey, everybody, get ready.
hold on, hold on. Let's just see what he does, all right?
let's see what he's doing.
there's nothing there.
nothing but your fingerprints on the finest cop killer money can buy.
come on, Stu. Let's see it. - Fuck, no! It's staying there.
fine, then someone will have to take your place.
come on, Stu, you're in a perfect position.
how do you figure? - You get to choose between them.
Pamela or Kelly? Should I choose? One of them can take your place.
don't do this!
you've got to be more in touch with your feelings. I thought you only loved Kelly!
it's true! - But you lie to her.
it's complicated.
then I'll uncomplicate it, Stuart, by removing temptation. I say Pam.
No! Look, this isn't Pam's fault. This is all my fault!
she's innocent!
Ticktock, ticktock. Time's running out. Okay, Kelly, then.
you decide. - No, please!
come on, Stu. Don't you get the game yet?
you're a selfish guy. Pick one and save yourself.
blond or brunette? Time's running out.
you or them? Kelly or Pam? Kelly or Pam?
come on, Stu!
stop this.
I can't take this anymore. - What are you doing? Get up!
I was looking for my ring. Look... - Get up, Stuart!
stand up and be a man. You're embarrassing yourself.
captain! I got it. Listen.
the rifleman reports subject pulled a small, dark object out of his pocket.
all right. You're looking at a suicide on national fucking TV.
you gonna let me take this over?
tell everybody to hold on, to hold their fire.
everybody hold. Stay ready, but hold.
Stuart, you're beginning to annoy me. - You can't do this.
Stu. No more spinning, no more excuses.
What're you doing? Look, listen. Listen, please listen to me.
no more delays, Stuart.
look... I'm on my knees begging you not to kill me.
I will if you keep up this pathetic spectacle.
excuse me! He's on the phone, talking.
from up in your high window, you could kill anyone.
Yes, I know that, Stuart. - All right, and...
you could pick off any of the cops, with your rifle.
shut up and stand up!
look, why threaten Kelly?
you liked how she sounded on the phone at the store.
please don't hurt her. Don't fucking hurt my wife.
this doesn't have to end with me shooting you. You leave no choice.
now, get up! - All right.
okay, how does this end? Tell me how this ends.
the stage is almost set.
people are gonna be eating dinner watching you die.
we got a sniper situation here.
what about that phone call to your store?
I got a phone call this afternoon. I think it was a prank call.
he told me Stu would be calling me from a phone booth.
how long will it take to get a record of her calls?
if he's using that secure line, we won't know more than now.
say he didn't. Let's assume he's a human, makes mistakes like all of us.
I need to get that number. I've been waiting for that number.
it was a guy. He sounded like mid-30's.
Mrs. Shepard? It would be safer if you got back in the car, okay?
please get back in the car. - Thank you.
I want you to divert incoming ESU units to Broadway and hold them there.
want me to clear the streets? - Yeah.
no, no, no. I don't want the sniper to be aware of any of our movements.
he's already got position on us.
let's not let him know we know too much, okay?
Hey, Jonah. - Yeah.
don't look up.
get me sharpshooters looking at those windows.
you got it, captain. - I'm gonna buy us some time here.
all right.
Stu! It's okay if I come out and talk to you for a second?
I don't know. - This guy is so lonely.
all he wants to do is talk. - You're walking through a bad dream...
...and you can't wake up. - Now he's really testing my patience.
you wanna wake up, Stu?
I wanna, but I got issues I can't talk about.
that your psychiatrist on the phone? - Yeah, yeah. I'm paying him overtime.
that was pretty brave what you did.
I mean, admitting all that stuff to your wife.
it was liberating, right? - Should've been.
maybe if I could be more honest with my wife then...
...I don't know, something would've turned out different.
Oh, please.
trust is the key. You trust me, Stu? - Get this man a seat on Oprah.
I wanna, but I got the issues I can't talk about.
Yes, lethal issues. Tell him to stay back.
look, don't come any closer.
Hey, I don't wanna cause or make anything harder for you.
Pam, Ramey, Kelly, people on the street, you've got lives in your hands.
I told you it's a private conversation. What the fuck do you want?
I wanna let you know that it's safe outside the booth.
it's not. - It's always, "Get out of the booth!
I like it in the fucking booth! All right? It's my world.
this is my booth, and I'm not coming out. All right?
never. - We're not gonna force you out...
...because there could be some miscalculation...
...and then I would never find out why this happened.
Stu, I'm afraid. I'm afraid that I'm gonna be standing by...
...and my men are gonna shoot some guy...
...and when we find out what's in his hand, once we turn over his body...
...and we see what he was threatening people with...
we realize that it was just a little black Bible.
or a cell phone. - Don't push me, Stu.
I'm not gonna let that happen here.
I wanted to make a phone call. One lousy call...
that's enough, Stu.
you got some bad news on that call? - The worst.
I bet you want to jump off the edge.
I've been falling ever since. - I'm gonna push him over the edge.
just say the word.
it's time to land.
when you hit bottom, you die. - I'm your safety net.
Oh, please, say the word.
if I tell you what you wanna know, you'll die too.
exactly.
I'm going. - Good.
but, Stu, we put a call out to your lawyer.
your wife, she gave us the number.
and I got my best men working on bringing him down. Okay?
that's it. The captain gets a bullet.
get out of here! Hear what I said, asshole?
get out of here, go on, now! Go! - Enough of this sideshow, Stu.
your sins have caught up to you. - So this is all some religious thing?
that explains it. Bible-crazed killer picks on fashion-obsessed PR guy.
tell me what you want, then. - What everyone wants...
...for the bad guy to get what he deserves.
go for the gun.
kill myself? - Yes.
it would be a rare, unselfish act.
we got hostile action. - Nothing is hostile until I say it is.
look, I can't find it. - Kelly, Pam, bam! Bam!
all right! Look, I found it. I got it.
then let's see it. Let everyone see it. - The cops'll kill me.
Yes. You're talking prime-time material now.
all this shit just to watch me die? - No.
to get you to do what's right. If you wanna save yourself, confess.
I already told Kelly everything. - Everything?
no. No more excuses and half-truths, Stuart.
you look out into those cameras and you bare your soul.
TV seems to help bring out the worst in people.
you should be fine.
How're those techs doing? Anything? - No, not yet. Not yet.
we haven't found your lawyer yet, Stu. But we're getting close. Okay?
Stuart, I'm offering you a chance to redeem yourself.
come on, humble yourself in front of your loved ones...
...and millions of strangers and me. It's do-or-die time.
what, you couldn't find anyone worse than me?
not a murderer or a child molester but a publicist...
...who has fantasies about pretty little actresses.
who spends money on Italian suits and dry cleaning...
...so people think he's important. Who doesn't waste time being nice...
...to people who are of no use to him. These are my crimes?
Stuart, I know your crimes. Tell them.
I've never done anything for anybody...
...who couldn't do something for me. I string along...
...a kid with promises that I'll pay him money.
I keep him around because he looks up to me.
Adam, if you're watching, don't be a publicist. You're too good for it.
I lie to newspapers and magazines who sell my lies to more and more people.
I'm just a part of a big cycle of lies. I should be fucking president.
I wear all this Italian shit because underneath, I still feel like the Bronx.
I think I need these clothes, and this watch.
my $2000 watch is a fake, and so am I.
I neglected the things I should've valued most.
I valued this shit.
I take off my wedding ring to call Pam. Kelly, that's Pam.
somebody got a 20 on this Pam? - Don't blame her.
I never told her if I was married, and if I did...
...she would've told me to go home.
Kelly, looking at you now, I'm ashamed of myself.
I mean, I work so hard on this image, on Stu Shepard, the asshole...
...who refers to himself in third person, that I only proved I should be alone.
I've been dressing up as something I'm not for so long...
...l'm so afraid you won't like what's underneath.
but here I am. I'm just flesh and blood and weakness.
I love you so fucking much.
I take off this ring because it only reminds me of how I've failed you.
and, I don't wanna give you up.
I wanna make things better, but it may not be my choice anymore.
you deserve better.
you're not gonna let me go. - No.
you never were. I know a thing about lies.
I know a thing or two about liars as well.
then why the confession?
I didn't do it for you.
right there. - Yeah, got that.
captain, captain. The call to his wife originated at 2: 17...
...at a hard line from the old Barkley Hotel.
you got a room? - 604.
second window from the corner. ESU units holding.
cover the windows, doors, fire escape, every goddamn point of exit.
ESU, ESU, come in from the 52nd... - Stu!
your lawyer's coming down now! - Doors, fire escapes...
now!
at least you'll die with a clean conscience.
no, you're the one that's gonna die! Listen, you can hear them now.
they're coming to get you. Know why?
because I sent them! - You can't stop lying, can you?
I can't stop lying? They're coming up the stairs.
they're coming to get you. Look around.
that room's getting smaller every second.
inch by inch! You know what?
it's not gonna be any bigger than this fucking goddamn booth!
they're in position, in position. - Get them to move!
there's nobody there. - There's nobody there?
they're coming through that fucking door to put you out of your misery.
you got a couple seconds left. What're you gonna do?
if this is true, I have to take someone with me, don't I?
since Kelly is the most important thing in your life, I'll take her.
then take me! Take me. This is about me!
I'm the fucking one you want! Take me!
this is about me! Come on!
take me! It's me you want!
this is Captain Ramey. Somebody talk to me.
we're too late. The psycho heard us coming...
...and slashed his throat with a knife.
what's his condition? - Critical. He's lost a lot of blood.
get him down here. I don't want nobody dying on me.
all right.
Kelly, where's Kelly? - Your wife's fine, all right?
all right, try not to sit up.
what hit me? - Rubber bullet.
figured if somebody's gonna shoot you, it might as well be us.
Thanks.
did you get him? - You did.
I didn't do anything. - Give yourself some credit.
got yourself out alive. Doesn't always happen that way.
are you okay? - It's okay. I'm okay.
God. I was so afraid.
I thought I wasn't ever gonna see you again.
me too.
we've got things to talk about.
I only want to talk about what you want to tell me.
I want to tell you everything. Everything.
get that gurney over here. Get over here.
we lost him.
I want to stand up. - I got him.
sure you can hold on? - I gotta see him.
you don't want to see this. - Yes, I do.
take it easy. - Yes, I do.
allow me. Allow me. - Go ahead.
you recognize him?
Yeah. He was down here trying to deliver me a pizza...
...10 minutes before I got the call.
I told him to fuck off.
that's enough these days.
just give it a minute.
we'll be driving, and you'll be flying.
whatever you say.
what a piece of shit.
nice shoes.
Italian.
you hung up, Stu.
I didn't get a chance to say goodbye.
I feel bad about the pizza guy.
but I couldn't miss seeing you and Kelly reunited.
you don't have to thank me. Nobody ever does.
I just hope your newfound honesty lasts.
because it if doesn't, you'll be hearing from me.
isn't it funny?
you hear a phone ring, and it could be anybody.
but a ringing phone has to be answered, doesn't it?
doesn't it?
Hello?

1 2 million in the greater metropolitan area.

Donny G is an artist who happens to look like a supermodel.
the New Guys is offering him the cover. -New Guys wants him?

I got it. -All right, tell me Richard didn't see it.
he didn't put it in the column?
Stu's on the phone, scared he's gonna lose his job.
his office sent you something by mistake. He wants it.

well, no more drinks or free meals, okay?
one lousy mention in the Post, you expect to eat for six months? No!
Mario, maybe I could throw the hippest party this month your way.
Stu. -No, I couldn't. My clients would kill me.
what hip party? -It's just Big Q, the hottest new rap star.
there'll be local TV coverage... -Nine and 1 1.
mtv, BET, VH1.

excuse me. -l'm trying to make a call here.
this is for you. Half-pepperoni, half-mushroom, extra crisp.
you ever heard of delivering a pizza to a phone booth?
I don't think so.
gentleman occupying phone booth, 53rd, between Broadway and 8th.
it's a mistake.
what am I supposed to do with the pie? It's all paid for.
there's a homeless guy around the block.
give him the pizza and say "You can turn away, but you can't make it go away."
he'll think l'm trying to poison him. They always get that idea.
get off the fucking pizza, all right?
that language is uncalled for.
holy shit!
I'm sorry. Please return to sender.
fuck off.
here you go, $5. Eat the pizza yourself. You look like you could use a good meal.
hello.
Pam, could you believe some nut case just tried to deliver me a pizza?
why are you always in the same phone booth, same time, every day?
well, it's quitting time, right? -Thank God, we were mobbed today.
so how's your day?
it's getting better by the minute, sweetheart.
who's the most famous person you publicized today?
you. -Really?
I told a few columnists Mel Gibson was looking for actresses for his film.
and I said the possibilities were Cameron Diaz, Julia Roberts and my favorite client, you.
you didn't really do that.
first step toward being noticed is being mentioned.
I just got out of a conference at the City Hotel.
I was thinking you could come down.
there are a couple of people and a few martinis I'd like to introduce you to.
Stu, l-- -Listen, Pam. Pam. Pam.
it's about time we talked about your career. Come on.
I feel awful but I promised my scene partner that I would rehearse for class.
we're doing a scene from Jerry Maguire. I'm playing Renee Zellweger's part.
that's great. Look, I rescheduled a meeting to see you...
... but I guess I can reschedule it back.
are you mad? -Don't worry about it. I'm not mad.
maybe tomorrow.
Yeah, later.
look, Stu... -What?
big kiss.
you too.
Yeah. -Isn't it funny?
you hear a phone ring, and it could be anybody...
... but a ringing phone has to be answered, doesn't it?
what?
I hope you realize ho w you've hurt my feelings.
who the fuck is this? -Don't think about leaving that phone.
wrong number, pal. -It was a perfectly delicious pizza.
you're certainly going to wish you had accepted it.
naturally, this is part of the gag. The pizza bit. That was funny shit.
well, its purpose was to keep your strength up for what's coming next.
what's coming next is I'm hanging up. -Oh, no, you won't.
you're going to learn to obey me. -Obey you?
who is this? -Someone who enjoys watching you.
watching me?
Yes, I love the suit you're wearing today. Black on raspberry sorbet. Very Italian.
where? Where are you?
there are hundreds of windo ws out there. Why don't you check them out?
so, what am I doi ng now? - You're scratching your head.
now you're brushing your hair back.
that's not very nice, Stu.
did you call me Stu?
who's Stu? I don't know any Stu. - Why, do you prefer Stuart?
a lot of people in this neig hborhood know me.
Stuart Shepard, 1326 West 51st Street, Third Floor, front.
go mi nd -fuck some other guy, pal. -I know Pamela McFadden too.
it's not in your best interest to disconnect me.
someone could get hurt.
what's the matter, Stu?
if you're some fucked -up, failed actor I wouldn't handle...
... or some prick intern I fired, I will hunt you down and I will crush you.
you will never work in this town.
I can turn people into gods...
...and I can turn you into a total fucking loser if you weren't one already.
do you hear me? Am I upsetting you? Hello.
Oh, you think l'm gonna, what? Pay you off or something?
tell me what you want. -Now you want to talk to me.
did Adam at my office put you up to this?
no, I thought this up all by myself.
keep thinking. I'm hanging up.
I'll say hi to your wife, Kelly, for you. Talk to you later.
what the...?
the callback feature cannot be activated
motherfucker.
tell me what you want. -I want your complete attention.
are you an actor? - Yes. One of your pathetic failed ones.
lt's tough when you're not known. - Tell me about it.
you don't have to hunt me and crush me. I can't get work in this to wn as it is.
I've done some off-Broadway, some off-Manhattan plays, but that dried up.
now I wait tables, clean toilets, anything to make the rent.
I'm a walking cliche.
I can help you. I can get you auditions.
auditions? You're not an agent. You're a publicist.
Yeah, but I have contacts. I know agents. I can get you an audition.
Really? -Yeah.
well, there is someone I'd like you to call.
name it.
try the number you dialed when you first got into the booth.
I don't know what you're tal ki ng about. -No?
lucky you then, because I wrote it do wn.
I can see every number you pressed. Let's see if Pam is still at work.
no. - Then I guess I'll have to do it.
look, don't! - Too late. It's already ringing.
I'll put her on speaker so you can hear. -You're fucking kidding me.
Stu, I never kid.
hello. - Well, hello, Pam.
Hi, who's this? -It's a good friend of Stu's.
and he hasn't got many. -You know Stu?
I know he lies.
who is this? -Don't worry about that.
Stu's listening in. He can hear what we're saying about him.
Stu, is that true? Are you there? -Pam, hang up the goddamn phone!
she can't hear you, Stu.
Pam, I'm afraid Stu hasn't been totally honest with you.
what do you mean? -Don't do this.
Stu has been lying to you. -Pam, hang up.
no, why would a man who has a cell phone call you every day from a phone booth?
because he said it's quiet. -Pam, that's just stupid.
it's because his wife checks his cell phone bills.
no record of his calls to you. -Jesus Christ.
he said he wasn't married. -Oh, he's married.
her name is Kelly. I've never seen her but she sounds lovely.
why do you think he invites you to the City Hotel?
cheap rooms for cheap girls. -Asshole.
he's telling you all this so you'll sleep with him.
he's lying, Pam. Don't listen. -I know that, okay?
I may be from Montana, but we have men there also.
I wasn't planning on sleeping with him.
I just don't know a lot of people here right now.
and he's cute and he said that he would help me.
you never asked me if I was married. -He's never made anyone a star. Bye.
Hello?
back to you, Stu.
gotta hit this trick before the next bitch takes my score.
go away. -Go away? Hang up the phone, nigga.
this motherfucker, you don't eyeball me. Bitch.
why are you doing this? Did I ever harm you? Did l--?
now, let's call Kelly. -She's not home.
Oh, but I'm sure she's at the shop on Columbus.
how the fuck do you know all this shit?
speed dial her. Press "auto one." That's her button.
what am I supposed to say? - Why don't you try the truth?
you're cheating. -I'm not cheati ng on Kelly. I never have.
then what do you call it? -Look, you're a guy...
... sometimes you want to know it's a possibility.
it's like having a beautiful home...
... but you still dream of that quick vacation.
you know, some nice hotel room with a great view, maybe a pool.
it's just a fantasy. You never leave home.
do you hear what l'm saying? -Kelly is a home and Pam is a motel.
I'm sure they'll both appreciate that. -Fuck you.
Hey, that kind of language is uncalled for.
you can't take up the whole booth. This here's my busi ness.
this is not the only phone in New York.
it's the only one on 8th Avenue that's working.
bullshit! Go in a restaurant, but get lost. -Motherfucker, this is my phone. Get
goddamn it, man! You done made me hurt my dick hand.
I'm sure you're just as good with the other hand. Yeah, go away.
I'll be back, motherfucker. I will be back, bitch. Get out of my way!
I was worried for you. I thought she was gonna put an eye out with that hand.
whoever you are, you're obviously a very intelligent man.
I know what stress does. It's all I can do from going crazy myself.
you're calling me crazy? -No, you're going through a difficult time.
look, please don't call my wife.
let me give you my office number. We'll talk.
I know a reasonable photographer who will do some headshots.
Stu, do you really think that I'm an actor?
I'm not an actor. I have no use for you, Stu. None.
I would just like you to tell Kelly the truth about yourself.
so are you going to call Kelly and tell her about Pam?
or do I have to? -No!
Jesus, no. I'm doi ng it.
feeling kind of nervous, Stu?
hello. -Hold it to the receiver so I can hear.
Stu? -Yeah.
where are you? -I'm in a phone booth.
baby, I just got this call from this guy who said you'd be calling me from a booth to tell me something important.
there's a lot of prank calling going on today, baby.
tell her you invite women... -Shut up.
... to have drinks at discreet hotels.
I'm not talking to you, baby.
someone's got company.
who's that woman? -Bitch got a cell phone!
some hooker is trying to use the phone. -He just called me a hooker.
are you sure there's nothing wrong? -We are escorts. Escorts.
tell her you want to sleep with other women.
there is this person and he's saying things about me.
things that might not be true.
and if he calls you-- Get the fuck out of here before I call the cops!
honey, I want to sleep with other women.
look, Kelly, whatever he says, don't believe him.
I haven't done anything. -Only because Pam had to rehearse.
shut the fuck up!
Stu, I don't know what you're talking about, but you're scaring me.
I'm sorry, baby.
can you just come over to the store so we can talk in person?
I feel kind of weird. -Yeah. Look, I'll try. Don't worry.
come on! -Yeah, bitch!
I love you too. - I love you.
get out of here before I have you deported to Jersey.
you're a fucking ass! -And you're a dirty skank.
what are you gonna do about it? -Your mama is a skank, bitch!
you didn't tell your wife the truth, did you, Stu?
and you can tell she really loves you.
must be nice to have a pretty girl care for you.
why screw up her life? She never did you harm.
everybody does harm.
that's it. This mind -fuck is over.
Stu, if you hang up, I will kill you.
what are you going to do about it with your goddamn binoculars?
I never said I had binoculars.
I have a highly magnified telescopic image of you.
now what kind of device has a telescopic sight mounted on it?
what? You mean like a rifle?
A. 30-caliber bolt-action 700 with a carbon-one modification...
... and a state-of-the-art Hensholdt tactical scope.
and it's staring straight at you. -Yeah, how's my fucki ng hair?
at this range, the exit wound ought to be about the size of a small tangerine.
nice try, pal. Go to hell.
now, doesn't that just torque your jaws?
I love that.
you know, like in the movies just as the good guy is about to kill the bad guy, he cocks his gun.
now why didn't he have it cocked?
because that sound is scary.
it's cool, isn't it?
look, you shoot a g un here and there'll be pandemonium.
do you hear me? There will be cops all over this block.
do you think so? Let's see. One. Two.
that won't help you.
three.
Stu, look at everybody. Look at all of the people screaming, Stu.
here come the cops.
sniper on the roof. Gunfire, hit the deck.
Stu, you still with me?
stand up and be a man.
so do you mean you would whack me for no particular reason?
no, I have plenty of reasons, and you keep giving me more.
shall I take care of him? -No! No. Shit, no.
it would be so easy.
here.
here.
Stu, you just gave that gentleman $ 10 to walk away.
you saved his life. You do have a sensitive side.
how much to let me go? -Let's see how sensitive you really are.
I'm aiming at you right now.
can you feel it, the heat of it?
come no w, Stu, you can feel it.
concentrate.
concentrate.
take a look at where I'm going.
you're doing so much better than the others.
you read about the German porn king shot 10 days ago at 38th and 8th?
he thought he was an artist and wouldn't admit he was just a pedophile.
believe me, he had plenty of chances to come clean.
you must have read about the corporate executive shot at 47th and 10th.
what you didn't read was that he cashed in all of his stocks...
...just before the bottom fell out, while all the little guys lost everything.
no w if he had been willing to make amends share the money, things might have been different.
please, tell me, where am I aiming no w?
below the shoulder. - Which one?
t he rig ht shoulder.
love to love you too, baby! - That's phenomenal, Stu.
you're doing so much better than the others.
what do you remember about those killings, Stu?
I don't know.
well, you think of yourself as a smart guy, Stu. Try.
t hey got shot. I don't know, all right? -Okay, I'll give you a hint.
wallets, watches, everything was left on their bodies.
because they weren't robberies. They were executions.
they didn't have to be.
what did I do to deserve this? Why me?
if you have to ask, then you're not ready to know yet.
right here. Shit. Come on. -Jesus. You, in the booth.
come on. -Now what?
you got any idea how much pain you're making in my life?
Hey, look at me. -Look, I hear you!
look me in the eye. Hang up the phone and walk away.
don't do it. -I got my own problems.
I'm your problem. You know why?
my girls keep yapping at me, Leon, he won't share the phone.
leon, he told us to fuck off.
we're gonna make you nuts unless you make him get off the fucking phone.
l'm trying to run a fucking business. -I sympathize, but I can't get off the call.
no, you don't understand me. I got the G-string union here.
they're breaking my balls.
I gotta live with their shit, but not yours.
so l'm saying this once, nice, all right? Hang up the phone. Walk away.
he did say it nicely. -He got a cell phone up in there too.
lt ain't even like he need a phone! -I can't get off the call!
shut the fuck up! Do you hear that shit? It's like nails on a chalkboard.
they ain't gonna fucking stop, till I get their way.
l'm getting a fucking headache, pal. -All right. I'll pay you to go away.
I don't want your money. I want you to hang up the phone and get out.
$ 1 20. It's all yours. -Everybody has their price, right, Stu?
you're gonna give me $120 to rent the booth the bums piss in?
y eah, I'm a nice guy. -Something ain't right with him.
look at that sweat pouring off that son of a bitch.
this one sick mother we started with. -It's probably catching too.
yo. -He's got AlDS.
how long you want to rent the booth? -lndefinitely.
lndefinitely? -Yes.
do I look like a asshole? Let me tell you something.
$500 gets you indefinitely. -Wait up! Hold the fuck up!
how come he's defying you, huh? What, you got bitch in you now?
did I say shut the fuck up? -Yeah, now talk to him like that!
Jesus Christ. Are you enjoying this?
do you need help? -Look, l'm handling it.
come on! -I can help you, Stu.
I wasn't gonna kill you before, but you changed my fucking mind.
I would take off if I was you. He gonna kick your ass.
he gonna kick your ass. -Get the fuck out!
can you get out of here? Will you go away?
he looks very angry. -Come on. I, look
hang up. -Get rid of him.
hang up the phone! -We can work this out!
get rid of him! -Hang up the phone.
I got a watch. It's a Solaris, $2000 retail.
yeah? I got a gold Rolex, motherfucker.
you got five seconds to get off the fucking phone. Five.
batter up. -Four.
I can stop him.
three.
just say the word, Stu. -Two. One.
no, no. Don't. Don't.
fuck.
this will count as a hang up.
I can make him stop. Just say the word. Can you hear me?
Yes. - What?
Yes!
whose street is this? -That's right, baby.
Oh, my God.
baby, you bleeding? You must've cut yourself
what's wrong? -You cut yourself.
what's wrong? What's wrong? -Baby? Leon? Leon!
he was fucking shot! -Oh, my God!
motherfucker! -He's shot!
Leon!
somebody call an ambulance!
call 411! -911, dumb bitch!
he ain't breathing. Call the meat wagon!
shut the fuck up! -You shot him.
why'd you fucking shoot him? - You said, "Yes."
Yes, I can hear you, not, "Yes, kill him!"
you ought to be more careful with what you say.
Oh, my God.
motherfucker, why? -lt wasn't me!
Where's the gun? Do you see a gun? -Fuck you!
you pumped one into him, bitch! I saw it! He's got a Glock!
get down! Get the fuck down! Daddy got a Glock!
what Glock? I don't have a fucking Glock! It's a telephone!
you shot my man, daddy! They gonna skin and fry your ass!
you shot my baby, daddy! Mr. Motherfucker! Mr. Motherfucker!
please, come on! Come in here, bitch!
better run, motherfucker!
the cops is coming and I hope they fry your ass down!
I'm not going anywhere, am l?
if you had dealt with the man decently, this might not have been necessary.
look, I offered him money. I offered him my watch.
but not your respect, which is what he really wanted.
you were dismissive like you dismissed the nice pizza guy.
you are guilty of inhumanity to your fellow man.
I'm not guilty of a goddamn thing.
take responsibility for what you've done, Stu. Be a man.
I love this fucking spin. You shoot the guy, and I'm fucking responsible?
well, looked that way from up here.
I don't know what I did to you but whatever it was, I'm glad.
I wish it had been worse. I wish you died!
Yes, finally some honesty. -Just tell me who you are.
no one you'd ever notice. I don't run in your circles.
and what is it you do? -I watch.
you watch? - Yes, well, what else is there to do...
... when life turns on you and you've retreated into some small room?
you look out your window.
you see people come in and out of this phone booth. The same ones every day.
you make up names for them. You imagine their stories.
but eventually, you get tired of imagining and follo w one of them.
and you hear all of his lies.
and you decide that his sins should be punished.
some guy shouting into a cell phone full of self-importance isn't gonna notice me.
but I noticed that German porn king, and I noticed that corrupt executive.
and I noticed you, Stu.
I'm flattered. -Operator 553. What is your emergency?
will you please respond?
what was so interesting about a guy in a phone booth on 53rd and 8th?
the Stu Show. Better than TV.
look, how'd I get so lucky to be picked up by a killer with a rifle?!
you had it made. Kelly at home, Pam on the side.
I saw Pam once. I followed her to her restaurant. Lovely.
life has given you more than your fair share, Stu.
but it appears you don't appreciate it.
look, look, listen, appearances can be deceivi ng.
I may look confident, but I'm really, actually just crying out for help!
help! You know?
I'm trying to help you, Stu, but you won't help yourself.
fuck. - What's the matter, Stu?
you shot me! -It's time you learn, Stu.
deception can't go unrewarded. -Deception! What fucki ng deception?
are you in need of immediate police or medical response?
shit. You bugged the fucking booth.
that's how you knew. That's how you knew about Pam.
you picked the wrong person to lie to. -Look, I didn't pick you.
it must have been your flashy suit that attracted me.
I get fucked on account of my clothes? That why you killed Leon?
I didn't kill Leon because of the way he dressed.
and those other two guys as well? Did they dress too nice?
you must feel really expensive when you walk out the door.
all rig ht, here come the cops.
what are you gonna do? Run?
no, I'm not a coward like some people I kno w.
you can get away if you run now. - You'll blame me for Leon.
no, no, I'll confess I shot him with my fucking phone.
well, then I urge you to keep one thing in mind, Stu.
take a look at your chest. You saw how accurate I can be, how lethal.
kill me now, and you give yourself away.
not with a silencer. It would take these guys the rest of the day to figure out it wasn't one of their own men that did it.
you can be shot 41 times for pulling out your wallet.
throw down your weapon and come out with your hands raised.
ignore him. -Yeah, what if they open fire?
they won't. Look around you, Stu.
do you see the tourists with the video cameras?
the ones hoping the cops will blow you a way...
... so they can sell the tape to The Most Gory Police Shootouts?
don't worry, they'll keep the police on their best behavior.
so long as you don't take hostile action, you should be safe.
safe? You call this safe?
I got a whole fucki ng preci nct here with g uns poi nted my way.
with both hands raised, moving slowly, step out of the booth.
if we see any signs of a weapon we will respond.
you won't because there isn't any!
put down the phone and raise your hands!
look, I can't. I'm on an important call.
verify this information for me.
the guy in the booth shot that guy over there...
...and stuck around to make a phone call.
Yeah, that's what the hookers are saying.
all right, give me the horn.
sir! I'm ordering you to fully comply. -l'm busy, all right. Come back later.
very good, Stu. -Step out of the booth...
...and raise your hands. I am giving you an order.
I give the orders here, Stu, don't I?
this guy is looking for us to kill him, captain.
suicide by a cop? Well, that's not gonna happen.
get that body out of here fast.
somebody get the body. T ell the ambulance to get the body.
thousands of people die every day, but you put one dead body in the middle of a busy street and it makes people crazy.
look at these guys. You can smell the fear.
ten cops. - This reminds me of Nam.
Vietnam? - Yes, Vietnam.
I was too young to go, but I've seen pictures.
well, pictures can't do it, Stu. You can't imagine the fear, the stench.
Napalm-charred bodies, children leaving grenades in your boots.
t hen you got blamed for the war. -I came home and people spit on me.
Yeah, this country owes you an apology.
look, I just had this vision of you, of a kid, coming back from the war...
...inured to the killing, not able to get work, isolated.
I think that could be made into an affecting story...
...and, you know, one that everyone understands.
and I think cops are on the side of vets.
you are pathetic, Stu. Why don't you wake up?
Napalm-charred bodies? I'd have to be 50 to be in that war!
stop fucking with my head, please!
I'm gonna go talk to him.
shouldn't we wait on the ESU negotiator?
they could take 20 minutes. I'm not gonna take a chance on this one.
I'm gonna handle this.
sir! I'm taking out my weapon.
putting my weapon down on the car.
the captain's going in. -l'm not armed.
Yeah, neither am l. -My name is Ramey.
captain Ed Ramey. -All right.
what's yours? -I don't want to be friends.
I don't know. It looks like you could use a friend right now.
tell him you've already got a friend. -I already got a friend.
is that who you're talking to on the phone?
look, I just want to hear your side of it. That's all.
I ain't got no side of it, and I didn't shoot anybody.
you see a fucking gun anywhere? Look.
it's in your back pocket! I see it! He been...
sir, do you have the weapon in your pocket?
no. I got a cell phone and I got cigarettes. I got no fucking weapon.
then what are you doing in a phone booth making calls?
you want to see it? Here. -Hey!
don't reach for that! Hold your fire!
I don't need to see it. I know what's there.
I got plenty of witnesses over here who saw you use it.
they didn't see it because it didn't happen!
shut them up! -He's dead, but it didn't happen?
then who did it? -Mustn't tell him, Stu.
I don't know. -You were the closest one to him.
you must've saw it happen. Help me. -No.
this guy is getting on my nerves. -Look, stay the fuck out of this.
who do you keep talking to on the phone?
nobody. -Your friend, your parent, your lover?
who? -Careful, Stuart. Careful.
my psychiatrist.
excellent. I should've thought of that. -I see. What's this doctor's name?
it would be really helpful to us if we knew.
he says not to tell you, all right? It's privileged information.
very good, Stuart. See, now you're having fun.
y eah, whatever you fucking say. -I respect your right to privacy.
I've been through therapy myself. The department provided it for me.
I know it's not good form for a cop to be saying that, but sometimes...
...you know, circumstances, stress-- I had issues. I lost my marriage over it.
tell him not to come any closer.
don't come any closer. Stop there. Go back a few steps.
go back to where you were! -Okay. No problem.
that's right. -So you got some intimacy issues.
I got those too. All I want to know is, what happened, man?
tell him to read you your rights. -I want you to read me my rights.
stop asking questions.
you have the right to remain silent. You have the right to an attorney.
if you cannot afford one, an attorney will be provided for you.
all right? So now, can you at least give me your first name?
just your first name. -Don't tell him.
it's my right not to have any first name.
no gun, no name. -That's right.
you're highly underprivileged. -Demand your lawyer.
and go get my lawyer too. All right?
I want an attorney brought down here to negotiate my surrender.
just brilliant, Stu. -I understand that, but...
... it's gonna be difficult to get a lawyer to come and risk his life.
once you hand over the gun-- -How can l?
you won't let me put my hand in my pocket?
we'll take it out for you. All you have to do...
...is step out with your hands raised. Nothing will happen to you.
it's not gonna work. -Stu, Stu.
what? -Ask him a question.
ask him if his wife got tired of sleeping with him.
l... Fuck. I can't do that. -Oh, sure you can, Stu.
ask him if he couldn't get it up, if he couldn't satisfy her.
are you gonna step out of the booth? -I can't. No.
you're not stepping out of the booth? -Ask him.
ls that a no? -Ask him!
both your lives depend on it. -Sir?
captain, you couldn't satisfy your wife sexually?
excuse me? -Ask him if he abuses himself now?
does he masturbate on lonely nights? -Fuck. For God's sake!
say it!
say it or I will blo w him a way!
so do you whack off now? -Hey!
I'm gonna see about that lawyer for you, okay?
y es. -Just relax.
Stu, I think you hurt his feelings. -I wanna know who's on that phone.
I want a techie here. I need to talk to somebody about that phone.
do you think we went too far, Stuart? Should we give ourselves up?
maybe I'd like someone to negotiate my surrender.
I'm sure we can work that out. -I won't just spill my guts to anyone.
could you get me national news? I mean, you've got connections, right?
sure. -Could you get Larry King do wn here?
why the fuck would Larry Ki ng come here?
because you're friends. Who else could you get, huh?
could you get Tom Broka w? Ho w about Dan Rather? Diane Sa wyer?
look, l, l, I don't know. T hey're busy. -I, I, I busy.
ho w about Mike Wallace? Ted Koppel? Peter Jennings? Katie Couric?
al Roker? Anybody? No! Nobody.
face it, Stu, you're smalltime. And you've got a credibility problem.
don't fucki ng worry about my credi bility! All right?
what about yours?
look, it's our friends from channels two and five. Your local news, Stuart.
you couldn't do this for your clients if your life depended on it.
but me, I've made you famous.
stick your head out so they can get a better angle on you.
they're here to cover me dyi ng. -How ungrateful.
those cameras will make the police very careful.
so come on, smile a little for them. -Can you tap i nto that phone call?
should be no problem. -Except...
... we'll need a warrant if he's on the line with his shrink.
fuck that. I'm not gonna jeopardize this on a technicality.
look, tracing, that's not a violation, right?
as long as we don't listen in. -Okay, this is what I want you to do.
I want you to find who he's talking to and their current location.
all right? We get that?
I want somebody to find out what's going on.
look across the street and see what everybody in New York is looking at.
you're the man, Stuart. You're the center of attention.
wait till this goes national: ABC, CBS, CNN, UPN...
you're gonna hit the whole alphabet, Stu.
I'll be forgotten about i n a week.
no one ever remembers the names of the victi ms.
it's the killers that get the cover of Time magazine. Right?
think about it. You'd be famous. Ted Bundy, John Wayne Gacy...
...fucking Jeffrey Dahmer. Name a victim. You can't.
anyway, I don't deserve to be the center of attention.
lt ought to be you they're covering. - That attention would embarrass me.
I know exactly the spin to put on this. -How terror inspires your creativity?
listen, this could be a media frenzy, all rig ht? You'd get Barbara Walters...
... I mean, Larry King if you still wanted him.
that approach seems predicated upon me surrendering without killing you.
listen, we can make you sympathetic, sit with a writer, bang out a book.
you know, movie of the week. Get America on your side.
all right, you killed Leon because he was gonna kill me.
you killed Leon to protect me. All right?
in a city where nobody looks out for anybody, you took a stand.
I'm your best witness.
so you want me to trust you to get me out of this?
y es, I do. I want you to trust me. T rust me.
Stu, you must think I'm crazy.
Oh, shit. Here comes Braman. -I'll take care of him.
Hey. Should've waited for me to initiate contact with the suspect.
I established a rapport. Let you know if I need help.
are you grandstanding for TV cameras?
or do you want to leave this to a professional?
until a professional gets here, I'll handle it.
you're a funny guy. All right, you get somebody else killed, it's on your head.
got it?
this is what I want to do, okay? This is the City Hotel here.
I want three guys in the lobby here. And five sharpshooters up here.
see if you can get me two in the subway.
what the fuck?
not going to answer it? -I can't. I can't reach for the phone.
the cops will think it's a gun. -I'll bet it's Kelly.
she's probably heard what you did. She's sick with worry.
I'm not gonna make her feel any better, am l?
well, you could ask her to forgive you, Stuart.
you could confess your sins and beg for absolution, come clean.
you're in this position because you're not telling the truth.
I'm i n this position because you got a g un!
no. Stuart, that is the sin of spin. A voidance and deception.
you're being given a chance here to make things right. No w, talk to her.
look, I can't. Please. -I am telling you to ans wer that phone!
excuse me! Excuse me! -You can't cross in front of here!
answer it!
look, I can't. Please. -Don't make me hurt you!
talk to your wife! -lt's not her calling.
how can you be so sure? -lt's you. It's you, you miserable fuck!
damn, you got me! You continue to impress.
you could shoot me, but you want them to do it!
Yes, well, that's an option. -Yeah.
captain. -Yeah?
this lady says the perp's her husband. Here's her lD.
I couldn't believe when I saw this. -Who do you think he's talking to?
I don't know. I spoke to him earlier today and I told him...
...that there was a man who called me. -A man?
did this upset him, that you were talking to other men?
Yes, he did seem a little upset, but it's, no-- It's not like that.
I didn't even know who this guy was. -Who's his psychiatrist?
he doesn't have one. -That you know of.
I've been with him three years, married for one. I'd know if he was in therapy.
I wish to God he had been. I saw somebody after my divorce.
it kept me from picking up a gun, doing something I would regret.
look, Stu didn't kill anyone. -Ma'am, under the circumstances...
...you need to consider whether your husband is who you thought he was.
because according to these witnesses over here, he has a gun...
... he has used that gun and let's pray to God that he doesn't use it again.
captain?
if you can think of any dispute he's having currently, please, tell me.
we're clearing City Hotel. I can stage an assault unit within feet of the booth.
we've also got sharpshooters securing rooftop positions.
let me know when you're in position. -Absolutely.
what about that wire tap?
we're working on it. You gotta hold tight a while, all right?
Yeah, no problem. No problem. -Okay.
Mrs. Shepard. Mrs. Shepard.
does he like being called Stuart or Stu? -Stu. Call him Stu.
Stu. Okay.
come with me, please.
Stu.
I have your wife with me.
that's how you knew she wasn't calling. You deceived me.
Stu! -She's not my wife.
are you okay?
can you just talk to me? - Yes, talk to her, Stu.
look, she's not my wife!
she's some fucked -up, failed actress I wouldn't handle. She's stalking me!
you aren't making this up? You are his wife, right?
Yes, here's a photograph of us together.
I don't know what he's talking about.
Stu. Listen to your wife.
she only wants what's best for you. -She's not my wife!
Stu, nobody wants to hurt you.
we just want to know what happened. -Yeah, very good.
go home, you fucking lunatic! You hear me? Go home!
please don't make things worse. Just come out.
just do what they tell you to do.
your wife is a crazy actress stalker and you don't know her.
that's an interesting match. -Get her out of here!
enough. I don't want to agitate this. -You out of your fucking mind?
come on, get the woman out of here! -No. I don't know what's going on.
he's bleeding-- We-- We're fine. This morning everything was fine.
you just stay here. Just stay here, okay?
okay. -I think she did some good.
you got a number of that lawyer? -No, we don't have a lawyer.
he asked for his lawyer to come negotiate his surrender.
well, we never needed one. -Well, you need a good one now.
look, you'll do me best by staying near here. Okay?
I'm gonna get your husband out alive.
l'm not going to let you fuck this up! -Get Mrs. Shepard out of here.
you know, get her some coffee or something.
you're gonna lose this guy. You need some kind of redemption.
what are you seeing a shrink for? -Get the fuck out of my face!
don't fucking touch me! -l'm not stepping down!
you okay?
Yeah, l'm fine.
you'd think she didn't know she was being watched.
what? -But beautiful women always know.
you talking about Kelly? - That false indifference, superior air...
... it's just a tease. They want eyes on them.
why does she put on her makeup, do her hair, dress so nicely?
not for her husband that she hardly ever sees.
no, it's for somebody else to notice. I notice.
what are you doi ng? Stay away from her. Leave her alone.
I'm giving her what she wants.
I bet you've never looked at Kelly the way I am right no w.
don't you dare fucking hurt her. -Don't I dare?
I'm not the one who has hurt her, Stuart.
what they can't kno w is what we do to them in our minds. Right?
you sick fuck! - The perfect violation.
leave her out of this. -How many times...
... have you had sex with Pam in that hotel bedroom in your head?
would you really miss Kelly if she was gone?
that's it. Not another word. I'm not tal ki ng to you.
your choices put other people in jeopardy.
when are you gonna learn that?
this is funny. Stuart, look upto wn.
these geniuses are still at the juncture box trying to tap in.
only I have installed an encryption device at both ends of the line.
there's no chance of a trap trace...
... so now they've gotta try some fancy LoJack instrument. It's really sad.
I hope you weren't pinning your hopes on those morons.
truth is, I'm on a wireless A. D. S. with a cloned number.
it'll take a half an hour to find out I call forwarded through Philadelphia.
and let me tell you, this will all be over before they can get a dial tone.
we can't get a trace or break into the line. It's like a ball of rubber bands.
I knew there was something weird about this. You keep working on it.
Stu. Stuart, come on, you're behaving like a child.
still gonna give me the silent treatment?
hello. Stuart, don't do this, please. Come on.
my sainted mother used to do this. She used to dish this out.
Stuart, please don't do this.
Stuart, you're bringing back my unhappy childhood.
Stuart, talk to me! Please, talk to me! I can't take it! Stu, please
I'm kidding. I had a very happy childhood.
Hey, there's our girl again. I wasn't planning on killing her...
... but plans change.
just tell me what the fuck you want from me.
hello. There you are. I thought I was talking to myself again.
anything you want. I'll do it. Just tell me.
tell Kelly about the real Stu, about your little motel.
and then you'll let us go? - Why not?
Kelly! - That's a start.
baby! -Hold her back!
Hey! -Talk to me!
grab her! Keep her back! -Yes
I'm listening.
Kelly, I called some woman.
every day. -Every day.
I was attracted to this other woman. And I called her and...
I wanted to fuck her. -And I wanted to sleep with her.
no. I wanted to fuck her.
say it. Say it! -And I wanted to fuck her.
I'm sorry. -Whatever you did, I don't care.
please, just come out of the booth. Okay?
that's all I did. That's all I did. I'm sorry.
all right, I've done what you asked. That's it. I've had enough of this.
I haven't.
you said you'd let us go. -I changed my mind.
you miserable fuck. You can't do this. You can't do this to me.
look, I took all your shit. I did everything you fucking asked.
you lied to me. I'm done with this.
I've fucking had enough. You can go fuck yourself! Later.
he hung up. -Maybe they already got a trace.
ESU, ESU?
l'm giving myself up! -He's coming out!
heads up! -I want to see you toss away your weapon!
throw the weapon outside the booth! Stay where you are!
first, the weapon! -Don't hurt him! Please, don't hurt him!
there's no fucking gun! -Stay right where you are!
I want you to turn around. Interlock your fingers behind your head. Okay?
please give them the gun! -Kelly, no!
get back! Kelly!
Freeze! -Get back! Get back!
get back! -Okay! Okay!
I gotta answer it.
Freeze! Don't move.
hold your fire!
hold your fire!
hold your fire.
hold. Hold. -Please.
go ahead. Answer it. -What the fuck are you doing?
he's coming out!
answer the phone.
you fucking coward. -Hi, Stu.
now, you've had your little tantrum and you said some things in anger...
... that I am willing to forget.
get her back in the car! I want her in the car.
if he's not the shooter, then who the fuck is?
captain, what the fuck is up with the phone calls?
so can we start over? -You lied.
you can't know the pain of betrayal until you've been betrayed.
sniper in one of these buildings. I want you to talk to ESU.
I want you to get one of these guys, this building.
start looking up there from window to window till you find the perp. Okay?
I want you to do it quickly, and I want you to do it quietly. All right?
Where's the ESU sergeant?
you said we could go.
you said you'd let us go. -Relax, Stuart.
nobody gets it right the first time.
you've done better than others. You will get a chance to end this.
I'm just not finished yet. -Yeah, well, I am.
t here's nothi ng keepi ng me. -Besides the fear of death?
I dive out and you've got one shot. I'm gonna be dancing.
you think you can get me? -I could go for some target practice.
one shot, they look for you. Second shot, you give yourself away.
go on, Stuart, hang up!
trust your fate to friendly men in flak jackets with automatic weapons.
I'm sure you can patch up that little misunderstanding about the dead body.
cops can't prove I killed anyone. - You had motive.
no weapon. -Plenty of loudmouth witnesses.
no gun and I walk.
are you sure? -Yes!
yeah? You murder a guy and you forget where you stashed your gun?
why don't you lift the plastic ceiling panel and feel around?
Peekaboo!
what's up next to the florescent bulb? Check it out, Stu.
cops see me reach for something, they'll blow me away.
there's only one way to find out.
look, the slugs in that dead guy, they came from your rifle.
they're not gonna match a handgun. I've seen enough cop shows.
hollow points fragment on impact, Stuart. There's nothing to match.
only there's no gun up there. -Don't take my word for it.
see for yourself. There are rounds left in it.
I totally could n't give a shit. -Come on. Don't disappoint me.
use your imagination. You'd shoot me if you got the chance, wouldn't you?
with a big fucking smile on my face.
there's the spirit.
now, what if I told you I was just above the theater, four floors up?
see the pink curtains?
there you go, Stuart. Yes.
Yoo-hoo!
Yoo-hoo!
why would you do that?
because it's fun. The odds are even no w, Stuart.
isn't that what you wanted?
you know where I am, and you have a gun.
if you have it in you, you can take me down.
fuck!
t hey'd kill me before I got a shot. -Oh, you're probably right.
I'm not really there anyway.
you would've just spoiled some nice lady's curtains.
looks like someone watches the news.
who? - The motel.
Oh, God. -I think she could use a new headshot.
don't! - Then take do wn the gun.
look, this has nothing to do with her! -She has everything to do with this.
you're here and she's here because you called her.
now, take it do wn! Don't make me hurt Pam, Stuart.
take do wn the gun! -Hey, everybody, get ready.
hold on, hold on. Let's just see what he does, all right?
let's see what he's doing.
there's nothing there.
nothing but your fingerprints on the finest cop killer money can buy.
come on, Stu. Let's see it. -Fuck, no! It's staying there.
fine, then someone will have to take your place.
come on, Stu, you're in a perfect position.
how do you fig ure? - You get to choose between them.
Pamela or Kelly? Should I choose? One of them can take your place.
don't do this!
you've got to be more in touch with your feelings. I thought you only loved Kelly!
lt's true! -But you lie to her.
it's complicated.
then I'll uncomplicate it, Stuart, by removing temptation. I say Pam.
No! Look, this isn't Pam's fault. This is all my fault!
she's innocent!
Ticktock, ticktock. Time's running out. Okay, Kelly, then.
you decide. -No, please!
come on, Stu. Don't you get the game yet?
you're a selfish guy. Pick one and save yourself.
blond or brunette? Time's running out.
you or them? Kelly or Pam? Kelly or Pam?
come on, Stu!
stop this.
I can't take this anymore. - What are you doing? Get up!
I was looking for my ring. Look-- -Get up, Stuart!
stand up and be a man. You're embarrassing yourself.
captain! I got it. Listen.
the rifleman reports subject pulled a small, dark object out of his pocket.
all right. You're looking at a suicide on national fucking TV.
you gonna let me take this over?
t ell everybody to hold on, to hold their fire.
everybody hold. Stay ready, but hold.
Stuart, you're beginning to annoy me. -You can't do this.
Stu. No more spinning, no more excuses.
What're you doing? Look, listen. Listen, please listen to me.
no more delays, Stuart.
look-- I'm on my knees begging you not to kill me.
I will if you keep up this pathetic spectacle.
excuse me! He's on the phone, talking.
from up in your high window, you could kill anyone.
Yes, I know that, Stuart. -All right, and...
you could pick off any of the cops, with your rifle.
shut up and stand up!
look, why threaten Kelly?
you liked how she sounded on the phone at the store.
please don't hurt her. Don't fucking hurt my wife.
this doesn't have to end with me shooting you. You leave no choice.
now, get up! -All right.
okay, how does this end? T ell me how this ends.
the stage is almost set.
people are gonna be eating dinner watching you die.
we got a sniper situation here.
what about that phone call to your store?
I got a phone call this afternoon. I think it was a prank call.
he told me Stu would be calling me from a phone booth.
how long will it take to get a record of her calls?
if he's using that secure line, we won't know more than now.
say he didn't. Let's assume he's a human, makes mistakes like all of us.
I need to get that number. I've been waiting for that number.
it was a guy. He sounded like mid-30's.
Mrs. Shepard? It would be safer if you got back in the car, okay?
please get back in the car. -Thank you.
I want you to divert incoming ESU units to Broadway and hold them there.
want me to clear the streets? -Y eah.
no, no, no. I don't want the sniper to be aware of any of our movements.
he's already got position on us.
let's not let him know we know too much, okay?
Hey, Jonah. -Yeah.
don't look up.
get me sharpshooters looking at those windows.
you got it, captain. -l'm gonna buy us some time here.
all right.
Stu! It's okay if I come out and talk to you for a second?
I don't know. -This guy is so lonely.
all he wants to do is talk. -You're walking through a bad dream...
...and you can't wake up. -Now he's really testing my patience.
you wanna wake up, Stu?
I wanna, but I got issues I can't talk about.
that your psychiatrist on the phone? -Y eah, yeah. I'm paying him overtime.
that was pretty brave what you did.
I mean, admitting all that stuff to your wife.
lt was liberating, right? -Should've been.
maybe if I could be more honest with my wife then...
... I don't know, something would've turned out different.
Oh, please.
t rust is the key. You trust me, Stu? -Get this man a seat on Oprah.
I wanna, but I got the issues I can't talk about.
Yes, lethal issues. Tell him to stay back.
look, don't come any closer.
Hey, I don't wanna cause or make anything harder for you.
Pam, Ramey, Kelly, people on the street, you've got lives in your hands.
I told you it's a private conversation. What the fuck do you want?
I wanna let you know that it's safe outside the booth.
it's not. -lt's always, Get out of the booth!
I like it in the fucking booth! All right? It's my world.
this is my booth, and l'm not coming out. All right?
never. -We're not gonna force you out...
... because there could be some miscalculation...
... and then I would never find out why this happened.
Stu, l'm afraid. I'm afraid that l'm gonna be standing by...
...and my men are gonna shoot some guy...
...and when we find out what's in his hand, once we turn over his body...
... and we see what he was threatening people with...
we realize that it was just a little black Bible.
or a cell phone. -Don't push me, Stu.
I'm not gonna let that happen here.
I wanted to make a phone call. One lousy call
that's enough, Stu.
you got some bad news on that call? -The worst.
I bet you want to jump off the edge.
I've been falling ever since. -I'm gonna push him over the edge.
just say the word.
it's time to land.
when you hit bottom, you die. -l'm your safety net.
Oh, please, say the word.
if I tell you what you wanna know, you'll die too.
exactly.
I'm going. -Good.
but, Stu, we put a call out to your lawyer.
your wife, she gave us the number.
and I got my best men working on bringing him down. Okay?
that's it. The captain gets a bullet.
get out of here! Hear what I said, asshole?
get out of here, go on, now! Go! -Enough of this sideshow, Stu.
your sins have caught up to you. -So this is all some religious thing?
that explains it. Bible-crazed killer picks on fashion-obsessed PR guy.
t ell me what you want, then. - What everyone wants...
... for the bad guy to get what he deserves.
go for the gun.
kill myself? - Yes.
it would be a rare, unselfish act.
we got hostile action. -Nothing is hostile until I say it is.
look, I can't find it. -Kelly, Pam, bam! Bam!
all right! Look, I found it. I got it.
then let's see it. Let everyone see it. -The cops'll kill me.
Yes. You're talking prime-time material now.
all this shit just to watch me die? -No.
to get you to do what's right. If you wanna save yourself, confess.
I al ready told Kelly everything. -Everything?
no. No more excuses and half-truths, Stuart.
you look out into those cameras and you bare your soul.
TV seems to help bring out the worst in people.
you should be fine.
How're those techs doi ng? Anything? -No, not yet. Not yet.
we haven't found your lawyer yet, Stu. But we're getting close. Okay?
Stuart, I'm offering you a chance to redeem yourself.
come on, humble yourself in front of your loved ones...
... and millions of strangers and me. It's do-or-die time.
what, you couldn't find anyone worse than me?
not a murderer or a child molester but a publicist...
... who has fantasies about pretty little actresses.
who spends money on ltalian suits and dry cleaning...
...so people think he's important. Who doesn't waste time being nice...
...to people who are of no use to him. These are my crimes?
Stuart, I know your crimes. Tell them.
I've never done anything for anybody...
...who couldn't do something for me. I string along...
...a kid with promises that I'll pay him money.
I keep him around because he looks up to me.
Adam, if you're watching, don't be a publicist. You're too good for it.
I lie in person and on the phone. I lie to my friends.
I lie to newspapers and magazines who sell my lies to more and more people.
I'm just a part of a big cycle of lies. I should be fucking president.
I wear all this ltalian shit because underneath, I still feel like the Bronx.
I think I need these clothes, and this watch.
my $2000 watch is a fake, and so am l.
I neglected the things I should've valued most.
I valued this shit.
I take off my wedding ring to call Pam. Kelly, that's Pam.
somebody got a 20 on this Pam? -Don't blame her.
I never told her if I was married, and if I did...
...she would've told me to go home.
Kelly, looking at you now, l'm ashamed of myself.
I mean, I work so hard on this image, on Stu Shepard, the asshole...
...who refers to himself in third person, that I only proved I should be alone.
I've been dressing up as something l'm not for so long...
... I'm so afraid you won't like what's underneath.
but here I am. I'm just flesh and blood and weakness.
I love you so fucking much.
I take off this ring because it only reminds me of how I've failed you.
and, I don't wanna give you up.
I wanna make things better, but it may not be my choice anymore.
you deserve better.
you're not gonna let me go. -No.
you never were. I know a thing about lies.
I know a thing or two about liars as well.
then why the confession?
I didn't do it for you.
right there. -Yeah, got that.
captain, captain. The call to his wife originated at 2: 1 7...
...at a hard line from the old Barkley Hotel.
you got a room? -604.
second window from the corner. ESU units holding.
bring them in from 52nd Street.
cover the windows, doors, fire escape, every goddamn point of exit.
ESU, ESU, come in from the 52nd-- -Stu!
your lawyer's coming down now! -Doors, fire escapes...
now!
at least you'll die with a clean conscience.
no, you're the one that's gonna die! Listen, you can hear them now.
they're coming to get you. Know why?
because I sent them! - You can't stop lying, can you?
I can't stop lying? They're coming up the stairs.
they're coming to get you. Look around.
that room's getting smaller every second.
inch by inch! You know what?
it's not gonna be any bigger than this fucking goddamn booth!
they're in position, in position. -Get them to move!
there's nobody there. -There's nobody there?
they're coming through that fucking door to put you out of your misery.
you got a couple seconds left. What're you gonna do?
if this is true, I have to take someone with me, don't I?
since Kelly is the most important thing in your life, I'll take her.
t hen take me! T ake me. T his is about me!
I'm the fucki ng one you want! T ake me!
t his is about me! Come on!
t ake me! It's me you want!
this is Captain Ramey. Somebody talk to me.
we're too late. The psycho heard us coming...
...and slashed his throat with a knife.
what's his condition? -Critical. He's lost a lot of blood.
get hi m down here. I don't want nobody dyi ng on me.
all right.
Kelly, where's Kelly? -Your wife's fine, all right?
all right, try not to sit up.
what hit me? -Rubber bullet.
figured if somebody's gonna shoot you, it might as well be us.
Thanks.
did you get him? -You did.
I didn't do anything. -Give yourself some credit.
got yourself out alive. Doesn't always happen that way.
are you okay? -It's okay. I'm okay.
God. I was so afraid.
I thought I wasn't ever gonna see you again.
me too.
we've got things to talk about.
I only want to talk about what you want to tell me.
I want to tell you everything. Everything.
get that gurney over here. Get over here.
we lost him.
I want to stand up. -I got him.
sure you can hold on? -I gotta see him.
you don't want to see this. -Yes, I do.
t ake it easy. -Yes, I do.
allow me. Allow me. -Go ahead.
you recognize him?
y eah. He was down here trying to deliver me a pizza...
... 1 0 minutes before I got the call.
I told him to fuck off.
that's enough these days.
just give it a minute.
we'll be driving, and you'll be flying.
whatever you say.
what a piece of shit.
nice shoes.
Italian.
you hung up, Stu.
I didn't get a chance to say goodbye.
I feel bad about the pizza guy.
but I couldn't miss seeing you and Kelly reunited.
you don't have to thank me. Nobody ever does.
I just hope your newfound honesty lasts.
because it if doesn't, you'll be hearing from me.
isn't it funny?
you hear a phone ring, and it could be anybody.
but a ringing phone has to be answered, doesn't it?
doesn't it?
there are an estimated 8 million people in the five boroughs of New York.
12 million in the greater metropolitan area.
there are almost 10 million telephone exchange lines.
over 50 phone services.
3 million New Yorkers are cell phone users.
it used to be a mark of insanity to see people talk to themselves.
now it's a mark of status. And speed dial is quickly replacing the drop of a coin.
despite increased usage of cellular devices...
... an estimated 4. 5 million residents and 2 million visitors...
... still utilize pay phones on a regular basis.
this is the telephone booth at 53rd and 8th...
... perhaps the last vestige of privacy on Manhattan's West Side.
it is the last booth of its type, still in regular operation.
up to 300 calls daily originate here.
this location has been burglarized 41 times in the last six months.
verizon has scheduled this structure to be torn down...
... and replaced with a kiosk as of 8 a. m. tomorrow.
hardly two blocks away...... meet the man who is to be the final occupant of that booth.
Donny. Donny. Donny, listen to me.
I said I'd get you magazine coverage, and I'm getting you in a magazine.
look, you gotta trust me. No means yes to these people.
get What's Up? magazine on the line.
Yeah, I heard you.
Donny, I got What's Up? magazine on the line.
they wanna know about you, so l'm hanging up.
this is Erica or Lars. I can't tell the difference.
you got Stu. -We said no.
I didn't hear you, so l'm giving you a second chance.
we don't do magicians. -Magicians?
Donny G is an artist who happens to look like a supermodel.
the New Guys is offering him the cover. -New Guys wants him?
and I haven't told my client, my favorite client...
...that I am making this call, all right? He wants New Guys.
I want you and I can make him come around...
... but you'll lose us if I don't hear from you by end of business.
get New Guys. Tell him What's Up? is offering a cover.
okay. Big Q.
Adam, I know three people looking for dog walkers. That could be you.
you got Stu. -What's up with my party, Stu?
I was just telling my assistant to get my favorite client...
...on the phone, and here you are. Nice.
listen. Seriously, we gotta look at a new night for your release party.
there are two premieres, a fundraiser. All the happening places are booked.
if we move the date
big Q, be reasonable. -Motherfucker, l'm a gangster!

I got it. -All right, tell me Richard didn't see it.
he didn't put it in the column?
Stu's on the phone, scared he's gonna lose his job.
his office sent you something by mistake. He wants it.

because l' m busy, Mario. -Yeah?
well, no more drinks or free meals, okay?
one lousy mention in the Post, you expect to eat for six months? No!
Mario, maybe I could throw the hippest party this month your way.
Stu. -No, I couldn't. My clients would kill me.
what hip party? -It's just Big Q, the hottest new rap star.
there'll be local TV coverage... -Nine and 1 1.
mtv, BET, VH1.

you got a bunch of messages. - l'm late for a meeting. Hold them.
all right. -All right.
see you, Stu! - See you, Adam!
excuse me. - l'm trying to make a call here.
this is for you. Half-pepperoni, half-mushroom, extra crisp.
you ever heard of delivering a pizza to a phone booth?
I don't think so.
gentleman occupying phone booth, 53rd, between Broadway and 8th.
it's a mistake.
what am I supposed to do with the pie? It's all paid for.
there's a homeless guy around the block.
give him the pizza and say "You can turn away, but you can't make it go away."
he'll think l'm trying to poison him. They always get that idea.
get off the fucking pizza, all right?
that language is uncalled for.
holy shit!
I' m sorry. Please return to sender.
fuck off.
here you go, $5. Eat the pizza yourself. You look like you could use a good meal.
hello.
Pam, could you believe some nut case just tried to deliver me a pizza?
why are you always in the same phone booth, same time, every day?
well, it's quitting time, right? -Thank God, we were mobbed today.
so how's your day?
it's getting better by the minute, sweetheart.
who's the most famous person you publicized today?
you. -Really?
I told a few columnists Mel Gibson was looking for actresses for his film.
and I said the possibilities were Cameron Diaz, Julia Roberts...
...and my favorite client, you.
you didn't really do that.
first step toward being noticed is being mentioned.
I just got out of a conference at the City Hotel.
I was thinking you could come down.
there are a couple of people and a few martinis I'd like to introduce you to.
Stu, l-- -Listen, Pam. Pam. Pam.
it's about time we talked about your career. Come on.
I feel awful but I promised my scene partner that I would rehearse for class.
we're doing a scene from Jerry Maguire. I'm playing Renee Zellweger's part.
that's great. Look, I rescheduled a meeting to see you...
... but I guess I can reschedule it back.
are you mad? -Don't worry about it. I' m not mad.
maybe tomorrow.
Yeah, later.
look, Stu... -What?
big kiss.
you too.
Yeah. -Isn't it funny?
you hear a phone ring, and it could be anybody...
... but a ringing phone has to be answered, doesn't it?
what?
I hope you realize how you've hurt my feelings.
who the fuck is this? - Don't think about leaving that phone.
wrong number, pal. - It was a perfectly delicious pizza.
you're certainly going to wish you had accepted it.
naturally, this is part of the gag. The pizza bit. That was funny shit.
well, its purpose was to keep your strength up for what's coming next.
what's coming next is I'm hanging up. - Oh, no, you won't.
you're going to learn to obey me. - Obey you?
who is this? - Someone who enjoys watching you.
watching me?
Yes, I love the suit you're wearing today. Black on raspberry sorbet. Very Italian.
Where--? Where are you?
there are hundreds of windows out there. Why don't you check them out?
so, what am I doing now? - You're scratching your head.
now you're brushing your hair back.
that's not very nice, Stu.
did you call me Stu?
who's Stu? I don't know any Stu. - Why, do you prefer Stuart?
a lot of people in this neighborhood know me.
Stuart Shepard, 1 326 West 5 1st Street, Third Floor, front.
go mind-fuck some other guy, pal. - I know Pamela McFadden too.
it's not in your best interest to disconnect me.
someone could get hurt.
what's the matter, Stu?
if you're some fucked-up, failed actor I wouldn't handle...
... or some prick intern I fired, I will hunt you down and I will crush you.
you will never work in this town.
I can turn people into gods...
...and I can turn you into a total fucking loser if you weren't one already.
do you hear me? Am I upsetting you? Hello.
Oh, you think l'm gonna, what? Pay you off or something?
tell me what you want. -Now you want to talk to me.
did Adam at my office put you up to this?
no, I thought this up all by myself.
keep thinking. I'm hanging up.
I'll say hi to your wife, Kelly, for you. Talk to you later.
what the--?
the callback feature cannot be activated
motherfucker.
tell me what you want. - I want your complete attention.
are you an actor? - Yes. One of your pathetic failed ones.
lt's tough when you're not known. - Tell me about it.
you don't have to hunt me and crush me. I can't get work in this town as it is.
I've done some off-Broadway, some off-Manhattan plays, but that dried up.
now I wait tables, clean toilets, anything to make the rent.
I can help you. I can get you auditions.
auditions? You're not an agent. You're a publicist.
Yeah, but I have contacts. I know agents. I can get you an audition.
Really? -Yeah.
well, there is someone I'd like you to call.
name it.
try the number you dialed when you first got into the booth.
I don't know what you're talking about. - No?
lucky you then, because I wrote it down.
I can see every number you pressed. Let's see if Pam is still at work.
no. - Then I guess I'll have to do it.
look, don't! - Too late. It's already ringing.
I'll put her on speaker so you can hear. - You're fucking kidding me.
Stu, I never kid.
hello. - Well, hello, Pam.
Hi, who's this? - It's a good friend of Stu's.
and he hasn't got many. -You know Stu?
I know he lies.
who is this? - Don't worry about that.
Stu's listening in. He can hear what we're saying about him.
Stu, is that true? Are you there? - Pam, hang up the goddamn phone!
she can't hear you, Stu.
Pam, I'm afraid Stu hasn't been totally honest with you.
what do you mean? - Don't do this.
Stu has been lying to you. -Pam, hang up.
now, why would a man who has a cell phone...
... call you every day from a phone booth?
because he said it's quiet. - Pam, that's just stupid.
it's because his wife checks his cell phone bills.
no record of his calls to you. - Jesus Christ.
he said he wasn't married. - Oh, he's married.
her name is Kelly. I've never seen her but she sounds lovely.
why do you think he invites you to the City Hotel?
cheap rooms for cheap girls. - Asshole.
he's telling you all this so you'll sleep with him.
he's lying, Pam. Don't listen. - I know that, okay?
I may be from Montana, but we have men there also.
I wasn't planning on sleeping with him.
I just don't know a lot of people here right now.
and he's cute and he said that he would help me.
you never asked me if I was married. - He's never made anyone a star. Bye.
Hello?
back to you, Stu.
gotta hit this trick before the next bitch takes my score.
go away. - Go away? Hang up the phone, nigga.
this motherfucker, you don't eyeball me. Bitch.
why are you doing this? Did I ever harm you? Did l--?
now, let's call Kelly. - She's not home.
Oh, but I'm sure she's at the shop on Columbus.
how the fuck do you know all this shit?
speed dial her. Press "auto one."
what am I supposed to say? - Why don't you try the truth?
you're cheating. - I'm not cheating on Kelly. I never have.
then what do you call it? - Look, you're a guy...
... sometimes you want to know it's a possibility.
it's like having a beautiful home...
... but you still dream of that quick vacation.
you know, some nice hotel room with a great view, maybe a pool.
it's just a fantasy. You never leave home.
do you hear what l'm saying? - Kelly is a home and Pam is a motel.
I'm sure they'll both appreciate that. - Fuck you.
Hey, that kind of language is uncalled for.
you can't take up the whole booth. This here's my business.
this is not the only phone
it's the only one on 8th Avenue that's working.
bullshit! Go in a restaurant, but get lost. -Motherfucker, this is my phone. Get
goddamn it, man! You done made me hurt my dick hand.
I'm sure you're just as good with the other hand. Yeah, go away.
I'll be back, motherfucker. I will be back, bitch. Get out of my way!
I was worried for you. I thought she was gonna put an eye out with that hand.
whoever you are, you're obviously a very intelligent man.
I know what stress does. It's all I can do from going crazy myself.
you're calling me crazy? -No, you're going through a difficult time.
look, please don't call my wife.
let me give you my office number. We'll talk.
I know a reasonable photographer who will do some headshots.
Stu, do you really think that I'm an actor?
I'm not an actor. I have no use for you, Stu. None.
I would just like you to tell Kelly the truth about yourself.
so are you going to call Kelly and tell her about Pam?
or do I have to? -No!
Jesus, no. I'm doing it.
feeling kind of nervous, Stu?
hello. - Hold it to the receiver so I can hear.
Stu? -Yeah.
where are you? -I'm in a phone booth.
baby, I just got this call from this guy who said you'd be calling me...from a booth to tell me something important.
there's a lot of prank calling going on today, baby.
tell her you invite women... -Shut up.
... to have drinks at discreet hotels.
I'm not talking to you, baby.
someone's got company.
who's that woman? - Bitch got a cell phone!
some hooker is trying to use the phone. - He just called me a hooker.
are you sure there's nothing wrong? - We are escorts. Escorts.
tell her you want to sleep with other women.
there is this person and he's saying things about me.
things that might not be true.
and if he calls you-- Get the fuck out of here before I call the cops!
honey, I want to sleep with other women.
look, Kelly, whatever he says, don't believe him.
I haven't done anything. - Only because Pam had to rehearse.
shut the fuck up!
Stu, I don't know what you're talking about, but you're scaring me.
I' m sorry, baby.
can you just come over to the store so we can talk in person?
I feel kind of weird. - Yeah. Look, I'll try. Don't worry.
come on! - Yeah, bitch!
I love you too. - I love you.
you're a fucking ass! - And you're a dirty skank.
what are you gonna do about it? - Your mama is a skank, bitch!
you didn't tell your wife the truth, did you, Stu?
and you can tell she really loves you.
must be nice to have a pretty girl care for you.
why screw up her life? She never did you harm.
everybody does harm.
that's it. This mind-fuck is over.
Stu, if you hang up, I will kill you.
what are you going to do about it with your goddamn binoculars?
I never said I had binoculars.
I have a highly magnified telescopic image of you.
now what kind of device has a telescopic sight mounted on it?
what? You mean like a rifle?
a 0.30-caliber bolt-action 700 with a carbon-one modification...
... and a state-of-the-art Hensholdt tactical scope.
and it's staring straight at you. -Yeah, how's my fucking hair?
at this range, the exit wound ought to be about the size of a small tangerine.
nice try, pal. Go to hell.
now, doesn't that just torque your jaws?
I love that.
you know, like in the movies just as the good guy...
... is about to kill the bad guy, he cocks his gun.
now why didn't he have it cocked?
because that sound is scary.
it's cool, isn't it?
look, you shoot a gun here and there'll be pandemonium.
do you hear me? There will be cops all over this block.
do you think so? Let's see. One. Two.
that won't help you.
three.
Stu, look at everybody. Look at all of the people screaming, Stu.
here come the cops.
sniper on the roof. Gunfire, hit the deck.
Stu, you still with me?
stand up and be a man.
so do you mean you would whack me for no particular reason?
no, I have plenty of reasons, and you keep giving me more.
shall I take care of him? -No! No. Shit, no.
it would be so easy.
here.
here.
Stu, you just gave that gentleman $10 to walk away.
you saved his life. You do have a sensitive side.
how much to let me go? -Let's see how sensitive you really are.
I'm aiming at you right now.
can you feel it, the heat of it?
come now, Stu, you can feel it.
concentrate.
concentrate.
take a look at where I'm going.
you're doing so much better than the others.
you read about the German porn king shot 10 days ago...at 38th and 8th?
he thought he was an artist and wouldn't admit he was just a pedophile.
believe me, he had plenty of chances to come clean.
you must have read about the corporate executive shot at 47th and 10th.
what you didn't read was that he cashed in all of his stocks...
...just before the bottom fell out, while all the little guys lost everything.
now if he had been willing to make amends...
...share the money, things might have been different.
please, tell me, where am I aiming now?
below the shoulder. - Which one?
the right shoulder.
you're doing so much better than the others.
what do you remember about those killings, Stu?
I don't know.
well, you think of yourself as a smart guy, Stu. Try.
they got shot. I don't know, all right? - Okay, I'll give you a hint.
wallets, watches, everything was left on their bodies.
because they weren't robberies. They were executions.
they didn't have to be.
what did I do to deserve this? Why me?
if you have to ask, then you're not ready to know yet.
right here. Shit. Come on. - Jesus. You, in the booth.
come on. - Now what?
you got any idea how much pain you're making in my life?
Hey, look at me. -Look, I hear you!
look me in the eye. Hang up the phone and walk away.
don't do it. - I got my own problems.
I'm your problem. You know why?
my girls keep yapping at me, "Leon, he won't share the phone."
leon, he told us to fuck off.
we're gonna make you nuts unless you make him get off the fucking phone.
l'm trying to run a fucking business. - I sympathize, but I can't get off the call.
no, you don't understand me. I got the G-string union here.
I gotta live with their shit, but not yours.
so l'm saying this once, nice, all right? Hang up the phone. Walk away.
he did say it nicely. - He got a cell phone up in there too.
lt ain't even like he needs a phone! - I can't get off the call!
shut the fuck up! Do you hear that shit? It's like nails on a chalkboard.
they ain't gonna fucking stop, till I get their way.
l'm getting a fucking headache, pal. - All right. I'll pay you to go away.
I don't want your money. I want you to hang up the phone and get out.
$120. It's all yours. - Everybody has their price, right, Stu?
you're gonna give me $120 to rent the booth the bums piss in?
Yeah, I'm a nice guy. - Something ain't right with him.
look at that sweat pouring off that son of a bitch.
yo. - He's got AlDS.
how long you want to rent the booth? - lndefinitely.
lndefinitely? -Yes.
do I look like an asshole? Let me tell you something.
how come he's defying you, huh? What, you got bitch in you now?
did I say shut the fuck up? -Yeah, now talk to him like that!
Jesus Christ. Are you enjoying this?
do you need help? -Look, l'm handling it.
come on! - I can help you, Stu.
I wasn't gonna kill you before, but you changed my fucking mind.
I would take off if I was you. He gonna kick your ass.
he gonna kick your ass. - Get the fuck out!
can you get out of here? Will you go away?
hang up. - Get rid of him.
hang up the phone! - We can work this out!
get rid of him! - Hang up the phone.
I got a watch. It's a Solaris, $2000 retail.
yeah? I got a gold Rolex, motherfucker.
you got five seconds to get off the fucking phone. Five.
batter up. - Four.
I can stop him.
three.
just say the word, Stu. -Two. One.
no, no. Don't. Don't.
fuck.
this will count as a hang up.
I can make him stop. Just say the word. Can you hear me?
Yes. - What?
Yes!
whose street is this? - That's right, baby.
Oh, my God.
baby, you bleeding? You must've cut yourself.
what's wrong? - You cut yourself.
what's wrong? What's wrong? - Baby? Leon? Leon!
he was fucking shot! - Oh, my God!
motherfucker! - He's shot!
Leon!
somebody call an ambulance!
call 411! - 911, dumb bitch!
he ain't breathing. Call the meat wagon!
shut the fuck up! - You shot him.
why'd you fucking shoot him? - You said, "Yes."
"yes, I can hear you," not, "Yes, kill him"!
you ought to be more careful with what you say.
Oh, my God.
motherfucker, why?! - lt wasn't me!
Where's the gun? Do you see a gun? - Fuck you!
you pumped one into him, bitch! I saw it! He's got a Glock!
get down! Get the fuck down! Daddy got a Glock!
what Glock? I don't have a fucking Glock! It's a telephone!
you shot my man, daddy! They gonna skin and fry your ass!
you shot my baby, daddy! Mr. Motherfucker! Mr. Motherfucker!
please, come on! Come in here, bitch!
better run, motherfucker!
the cops are coming and I hope they fry your ass down!
I'm not going anywhere, am l?
if you had dealt with the man decently, this might not have been necessary.
look, I offered him money. I offered him my watch.
but not your respect, which is what he really wanted.
you were dismissive like you dismissed the nice pizza guy.
you are guilty of inhumanity to your fellow man.
I'm not guilty of a goddamn thing.
take responsibility for what you've done, Stu. Be a man.
I love this fucking spin. You shoot the guy, and I'm fucking responsible?
well, looked that way from up here.
I don't know what I did to you but whatever it was, I'm glad.
I wish it had been worse. I wish you died!
Yes, finally some honesty. - Just tell me who you are.
no one you'd ever notice. I don't run in your circles.
and what is it you do? - I watch.
you watch? - Yes, well, what else is there to do...
you look out your window.
you see people come in and out of this phone booth. The same ones every day.
you make up names for them. You imagine their stories.
but eventually, you get tired of imagining and follow one of them.
and you hear all of his lies.
and you decide that his sins should be punished.
some guy shouting into a cell phone full of self-importance isn't gonna notice me.
but I noticed that German porn king, and I noticed that corrupt executive.
and I noticed you, Stu.
I'm flattered. - Operator 553. What is your emergency?
will you please respond?
what was so interesting about a guy in a phone booth on 53rd and 8th?
the Stu Show. Better than TV.
look, how'd I get so lucky to be picked up by a killer with a rifle?!
you had it made. Kelly at home, Pam on the side.
I saw Pam once. I followed her to her restaurant. Lovely.
life has given you more than your fair share, Stu.
but it appears you don't appreciate it.
look, look, listen, appearances can be deceiving.
I may look confident, but I'm really, actually just crying out for help!
help! You know?
I'm trying to help you, Stu, but you won't help yourself.
fuck. - What's the matter, Stu?
you shot me! - It's time you learn, Stu.
deception can't go unrewarded. - Deception! What fucking deception?
are you in need of immediate police or medical response?
shit. You bugged the fucking booth.
that's how you knew. That' s how you knew about Pam.
you picked the wrong person to lie to. - Look, I didn't pick you.
it must have been your flashy suit that attracted me.
I get fucked on account of my clothes? That why you killed Leon?
I didn't kill Leon because of the way he dressed.
and those other two guys as well? Did they dress too nice?
you must feel really expensive when you walk out the door.
all right, here come the cops.
what are you gonna do? Run?
no, I'm not a coward like some people I know.
you can get away if you run now. - You'll blame me for Leon.
no, no, I'll confess I shot him with my fucking phone.
well, then I urge you to keep one thing in mind, Stu.
take a look at your chest. You saw how accurate I can be, how lethal.
kill me now, and you give yourself away.
you can be shot 41 times for pulling out your wallet.
throw down your weapon and come out with your hands raised.
ignore him. -Yeah, what if they open fire?
they won't. Look around you, Stu.
do you see the tourists with the video cameras?
the ones hoping the cops will blow you away...
...so they can sell the tape to The Most Gory Police Shootouts?
don't worry, they'll keep the police on their best behavior.
so long as you don't take hostile action, you should be safe.
safe? You call this safe?
I got a whole fucking precinct here with guns pointed my way.
with both hands raised, moving slowly, step out of the booth.
if we see any signs of a weapon we will respond.
you won't because there isn't any!
put down the phone and raise your hands!
look, I can't. I'm on an important call.
verify this information for me.
the guy in the booth shot that guy over there...
...and stuck around to make a phone call.
Yeah, that's what the hookers are saying.
all right, give me the horn.
sir! I'm ordering you to fully comply. - l'm busy, all right. Come back later.
very good, Stu. - Step out of the booth...
...and raise your hands. I am giving you an order.
I give the orders here, Stu, don't I?
this guy is looking for us to kill him, captain.
suicide by a cop? Well, that's not gonna happen.
get that body out of here fast.
somebody get the body. Tell the ambulance to get the body.
thousands of people die every day, but you put one dead body...
... in the middle of a busy street and it makes people crazy.
look at these guys. You can smell the fear.
ten cops. - This reminds me of Nam.
Vietnam? - Yes, Vietnam.
I was too young to go, but I've seen pictures.
well, pictures can't do it, Stu. You can't imagine the fear, the stench.
Napalm-charred bodies, children leaving grenades in your boots.
then you got blamed for the war. - I came home and people spit on me.
Yeah, this country owes you an apology.
look, I just had this vision of you, of a kid, coming back from the war...
...inured to the killing, not able to get work, isolated.
I think that could be made into an affecting story...
...and, you know, one that everyone understands.
and I think cops are on the side of vets.
you are pathetic, Stu. Why don't you wake up?
Napalm-charred bodies? I'd have to be 50 to be in that war!
stop fucking with my head, please!
I'm gonna go talk to him.
shouldn't we wait on the ESU negotiator?
they could take 20 minutes. I'm not gonna take a chance on this one.
I'm gonna handle this.
sir! I'm taking out my weapon.
putting my weapon down on the car.
the captain's going in. - l'm not armed.
Yeah, neither am l. - My name is Ramey.
captain Ed Ramey. - All right.
what's yours? - I don't want to be friends.
I don't know. It looks like you could use a friend right now.
tell him you've already got a friend. - I already got a friend.
is that who you're talking to on the phone?
look, I just want to hear your side of it. That's all.
I ain't got no side of it, and I didn't shoot anybody.
you see a fucking gun anywhere? Look.
it's in your back pocket! I see it! He been...
sir, do you have the weapon in your pocket?
no. I got a cell phone and I got cigarettes. I got no fucking weapon.
then what are you doing in a phone booth making calls?
you want to see it? Here. - Hey!
don't reach for that! Hold your fire!
I don't need to see it. I know what's there.
I got plenty of witnesses over here who saw you use it.
they didn't see it because it didn't happen!
shut them up! - He's dead, but it didn't happen?
then who did it? - Mustn't tell him, Stu.
I don't know. - You were the closest one to him.
you must've saw it happen. Help me. -No.
this guy is getting on my nerves. - Look, stay the fuck out of this.
who do you keep talking to on the phone?
nobody. - Your friend, your parent, your lover?
who? - Careful, Stuart. Careful.
my psychiatrist.
excellent. I should've thought of that. - I see. What's this doctor's name?
it would be really helpful to us if we knew.
he says not to tell you, all right? It's privileged information.
very good, Stuart. See, now you're having fun.
Yeah, whatever you fucking say. - I respect your right to privacy.
I've been through therapy myself. The department provided it for me.
I know it's not good form for a cop to be saying that, but sometimes...
...you know, circumstances, stress-- I had issues. I lost my marriage over it.
tell him not to come any closer.
don't come any closer. Stop there. Go back a few steps.
go back to where you were! - Okay. No problem.
that's right. - So you got some intimacy issues.
I got those too. All I want to know is, what happened, man?
tell him to read you your rights. - I want you to read me my rights.
stop asking questions.
you have the right to remain silent. You have the right to an attorney.
if you cannot afford one, an attorney will be provided for you.
all right? So now, can you at least give me your first name?
cannot say about Jack. but you'll find a ship there.
a ship with black sails.
my brother will take you ashore.
what's wrong? The beach is there.
bon voyage. monsieur.
anybody?
a familiar face.
don't eat me.
l'm not going to eat you. - Don't eat me.
no. Don't eat me.
come on! Who wants it?
l can do this all day!
l can honestly say l'm glad to see you.
Jack. it's me.
tell them to let me down!
Jack. the compass. That's all l need.
Elizabeth is in danger. We were arrested for helping you.
she faces the gallows!
save me.
Jack. what did you tell them?
No!
what about Elizabeth?
that's a good girl. Come a little closer.
we don't bite. - Go on. We won't bite you.
come quickly.
tell me what's happening. - Our name still has some standing.
l've arranged passage to England. The captain is a friend of mine.
No! Will's gone to find Jack!
we cannot count on William Turner.
come! - He's better than you give him credit for.
this is no time for innocence. Beckett has offered one pardon only
one. and that is promised to Jack Sparrow.
even if Will succeeds.
do not ask me to endure the sight of my daughter walking to the gallows. Do not.
perhaps l can ensure a fair trial for Will if he returns.
a fair trial for Will ends in a hanging. - Then there is nothing left for you here.
wait inside.
captain?
captain.
evening. Governor.
shame that.
he was carrying this.
lt's a letter to the king.
lt's from you. - No...
what are you doing?
where is she? - Who?
no doubt you've discovered that loyalty is no longer the currency of the realm.
as your father believes.
then what is?
l'm afraid currency is the currency of the realm.
l expect. then. we can come to some sort of understanding.
l'm here to negotiate. - l'm listening.
l'm listening intently.
these letters of marque are signed by the king.
Yes. and they're not valid until they bear my signature and my seal.
or else l would not still be here.
you sent Will to get you the compass owned by Jack Sparrow.
lt will do you no good. - Do explain.
l have been to the lsla de Muerta. l have seen the treasure myself.
there is something you need to know. - l see.
you think the compass leads only to the lsla de Muerta and so you hope to save me from an evil fate.
but you mustn't worry.
l care not for cursed Aztec gold.
my desires are not so provincial.
there's more than one chest of value in these waters.
so perhaps you may wish to enhance your offer.
consider into your calculations that you robbed me of my wedding night.
so l did.
a marriage interrupted or fate intervenes?
you're making great efforts to ensure Jack Sparrow's freedom.
these aren't going to Jack. - Really?
to ensure Mr Turner's freedom. then.
l'll still want that compass.
consider that in your calculations.
l say it was Divine Providence what escaped us from jail.
and l say it was me being clever.
ain't that right. poochie?
well. how'd you know it weren't Divine Providence what inspired you to be clever?
anyways. l ain't stealing no ship.
lt ain't stealing. lt's salvaging. And since when did you care?
since we're not immortal no more. We gotta take care of our immortal souls.
you know you can't read. - lt's the Bible. You get credit for trying.
pretending to read the Bible's a lie. That's a mark against...
look.
there it is.
what's got into him?
must have seen a catfish.
stupid mongrel!
come on!
lt's ours for the taking. - Tide's coming in. That should help.
and salvaging is saving. in a manner of speaking.
there's the truth of it!
suppose we better save it as soon as we can.
what with our souls in such a vulnerable state and all.
Amen to that.
thank you.
why would he do this to us? lf Jack is the chief...
Aye. the Pelegostos made Jack their chief.
but he only remains chief as long as he acts like a chief.
so he had no choice. He's a captive as much as the rest of us.
worse. as it turns out. See. the Pelegostos believe that Jack is a god in human form.
and they intend to do him the honour of releasing him from his fleshy prison.
they'll roast him and eat him.
Where's the rest of the crew?
these cages we're in weren't built till after we got here.
the feast is about to begin.
Jack's life will end when the drums stop.
well. we can't just sit here and wait. then. can we?
no. no. Oi! No. no.
more wood. Big fire. Big fire.
l am Chief. Want big fire.
come on.
tout de suite. Come on. More wood.
bugger.
a little seasoning. eh?
well done.
put your legs through. Start to climb!
come on. men! lt'll take all of us to crew the Black Pearl!
actually. you wouldn't need everyone.
about six would do.
Oh. dear.
Hurry! - Come on!
come on! ls that all you got?
wait. Stop.
stop.
what are they doing? - Stop.
snake!
move!
well. go on. go get them.
no. no. No. no!
not good.
cut it loose! Find a rock!
roll the cage!
come on!
lift the cage! Hurry! - Come on. lads. Lift it like a lady's skirt.
run!
this way. lads!
take cover!
stop it!
bugger.
haul loose the mooring line!
the mooring line!
thief! Little hairy thief! Give it back!
don't bite it! - Haul loose the mooring line!
he's got me eye. He won't give it back.
how'd you get it back last time? - Excellent! Our work's half done.
we done it for you. knowing you'd be coming back.
make ready to sail. boys! - What about Jack?
l won't leave without him.
time to go. - Cast off those lines!
make ready to cast off!
good doggy.
alas. my children. this is the day you shall always remember as the day you almost...
captain Jack Sparrow.
let's get away from this island and head out to open sea.
yes to the first. Yes to the second. but only insofar as we keep to the shallows.
that seems a bit contradictory. Captain.
l have faith in your reconciliatory navigational skills.
now. where is that monkey? l want to shoot something.
Jack. Elizabeth is in danger.
have you considered just locking her up somewhere?
she is locked up. bound to hang for helping you.
there comes a time when one must take responsibility for one's mistakes.
l need that compass of yours. Jack.
l must trade it for her freedom.
mr Gibbs. - Captain.
we have a need to travel upriver.
by need. do you mean a trifling need?
fleeting? As in. say. a passing fancy?
no. a resolute and unyielding need.
what we need to do is make sail for Port Royal with all haste.
l shall trade you the compass if you will help me to find this.
you want me to find this? - No.
you want you to find this.
because the finding of this finds you incapacitorially finding and/or locating in your discovering a way to save your dolly belle. ol' what's-her-face.
Savvy?
this is going to save Elizabeth?
how much do you know about Davy Jones?
not much.
Yeah. it's going to save Elizabeth.
what's all this?
lf you both fancy the dress. you'll just have to share and wear it one after the other.
lt's not like that. sir. This ship is haunted.
ls it. now? And you?
there's a female presence amongst us here. sir.
all the men. they can feel it.
searching for her husband. lost at sea.
a virgin too. likely as not.
and that bodes ill by all accounts.
l say that we throw the dress overboard and we hope the spirit follows it.
No! That will just anger the spirit. sir.
what we need to do is find out what the spirit needs. and then get it back to her.
enough! Enough!
you're a pair of superstitious goats and it's got the best of you.
now. this appears to be no more as we have a stowaway on board.
a young woman. by the look of it.
l want you to search the ship and find her.
Oh. and she's probably naked.
why is Jack afraid of the open ocean?
well. if you believe such things.
there's a beast does the bidding of Davy Jones
a fearsome creature with giant tentacles that'll suction your face clean off and drag an entire ship down to the crushing darkness.
the kraken.
they say the stench of its breath is like...
Lmagine. the last thing you know on God's green earth is the roar of the kraken and the reeking odour of a thousand rotting corpses.
lf you believe such things.
and the key will spare him that?
well. that's the very question Jack wants answered.
bad enough even to go visit her.
her?
Aye.
no worries. mates. Tia Dalma and l go way back.
thick as thieves. Nigh inseparable. we are.
were. Have been.
before.
l'll watch your back. - lt's me front l'm worried about.
mind the boat. - Mind the boat.
mind the boat. - Mind the boat.
mind the boat.
mind the boat.
l always knew the wind was going to blow you back to me one day.
you...
you have a touch of destiny about you.
you know me?
you want to know me.
there'll be no knowing here. We've come for help and we're not leaving without it.
l thought l knew you. - Not so well as l had hoped.
come. - Come.
what service may l do you?
you know l demand payment. - l brought payment.
look.
an undead monkey.
top that.
don't! You've no idea how long it took us to catch that.
the payment is fair.
we're looking for this.
and what it goes to.
the compass you bartered from me. it cannot lead you to this?
maybe. Why?
Jack Sparrow does not know what he wants.
or do you know.
but are loath to claim it as your own?
your key go to a chest.
and it is what lay inside the chest you seek. don't it?
what is inside? - Gold?
jewels? Unclaimed properties of a valuable nature?
nothing bad. l hope?
you know of Davy Jones.
yes?
a man of the sea.
a great sailor.
until he run afoul of that which vex all men.
what vexes all men?
what indeed?
the sea. - Sums.
the dichotomy of good and evil.
a woman.
a woman.
he fell in love.
no. no. no. no. l heard it was the sea he fell in love with.
same story. different versions. and all are true.
see. it was a woman as changing and harsh and untamable as the sea.
him never stopped loving her.
but the pain it cause him was too much to live with but not enough to cause him to die.
what exactly did he put into the chest?
him heart.
literally or figuratively?
he couldn't literally put his heart in a chest.
could he?
lt was not worth feeling what small. fleeting joy life brings.
and so him carve out him heart.
lock it away in a chest and hide the chest from the world.
the key he keep with him at all times.
you knew this. - l did not. l didn't know where the key was.
but now we do. All that's left is to climb aboard the Flying Dutchman. grab the key.
you go back to Port Royal and save your bonnie lass. eh?
let me see your hand.
the black spot!
the black spot! - Black spot!
my eyesight's as good as ever. just so you know.
l have just the thing. Now. where did l put it?
my little beauty. where are you?
such a long time in such a mess.
Davy Jones cannot make port.
cannot step on land but once every ten years.
land is where you are safe. Jack Sparrow.
and so you will carry land with you.
dirt.
this is a jar of dirt. - Yes.
ls the jar of dirt going to help?
lf you don't want it. give it back.
no. - Then it helps.
lt seems we have a need to find the Flying Dutchman.
a touch of destiny.
that's the Flying Dutchman?
she doesn't look like much. - Neither do you.
do not underestimate her.
must have run afoul of the reef. - So. what's your plan. then?
l row over. search the ship until l find your bloody key.
and if there are crewmen?
l cut down anyone in my path.
l like it. Simple. easy to remember.
your chariot awaits you. Sire.
lf you do happen to get captured. just say Jack Sparrow sent you to settle his debt.
lt might save your life. - Bon voyage!
douse the lamps.
sailor.
hoisting the jib. Captain's orders. - Sailor!
hoisting the jib. Bring up with a round turn.
there's no use. You've run aground.
no.
beneath us.
foul breath.
down on your marrowbones and pray.
get back! Get back!
five men still alive. The rest have moved on.
do you fear death?
do you fear that dark abyss?
all your deeds laid bare.
all your sins punished.
l can offer you an escape.
don't listen to him!
do you not fear death?
l'll take my chances. sir.
to the depths.
cruel blackguard!
life is cruel.
why should the afterlife be any different?
l offer you a choice.
join my crew and postpone the judgment.
one hundred years before the mast.
will ye serve?
l will serve.
you are neither dead nor dying.
what is your purpose here?
Jack Sparrow sent me to settle his debt.
what is your purpose here?
Jack Sparrow sent me to settle his debt.
did he. now?
l'm sorely tempted to accept that offer.
you have a debt to pay.
you've been captain of the Black Pearl for 1 3 years.
that was our agreement.
technically l was only captain for two years. then l was mutinied upon.
then you were a poor captain. but a captain nonetheless.
have you not introduced yourself all these years as Captain Jack Sparrow?
you have my payment. One soul to serve on your ship.
one soul is not equal to another.
we've established my proposal is sound in principle. Now we're haggling over price.
price?
just how many souls do you think my soul is worth?
one hundred souls.
three days.
you're a diamond. mate. Send me back the boy. l'll get started right off.
l keep the boy. A good-faith payment.
that leaves you only 99 more to go.
have you not met Will Turner?
he's noble. heroic. a terrific soprano.
worth at least four.
maybe three and a half.
and did l happen to mention he's in love?
with a girl.
due to be married.
betrothed.
dividing him from her and her from him would only be half as cruel as actually allowing them to be joined in holy matrimony. Eh?
l keep the boy. 99 souls.
but l wonder. Sparrow.
can you live with this?
can you condemn an innocent man. a friend.
to a lifetime of servitude in your name while you roam free?
Yep. l'm good with it.
shall we seal it in blood? l mean ink.
three days.
three days.
mr Gibbs. - Aye.
l feel sullied and unusual.
and how do you intend to harvest these 99 souls in three days?
fortunately. he was mum as to the condition in which these souls need be.
Tortuga.
Tortuga.
lt's an outrage. Port tariffs. berthing fees.
wharf handling and. heaven help us. pilotage.
are we all to work for the East lndia Trading Company. then?
l'm afraid. sir. Tortuga is the only free port left in these waters.
a pirate port is what you mean. Well. l'm sorry.
an honest sailor is what l am. l make my living fair and l sleep well each night.
sir!
she wants you to do something.
she's trying to give a sign.
over there! Look for a sign!
look. there! There it is!
there's the sign! - That's seaweed.
seaweed can be a sign. - Looks like entrails.
that would be a bad sign. - What's that over there?
and what makes you think you're worthy to crew the Black Pearl?
l've never sailed a day in me life.
l figure l should get out. see the world while l'm still young.
you'll do. Make your mark. Next!
my wife ran off with my dog and l'm drunk for a month and l don't give an ass rat's if l live or die.
perfect. Next! - l know what l want. l know what l want...
me have one arm and a bum leg. - lt's the crow's nest for you.
l know what l want. - Next!
ever since l was a little lad. l've always wanted to sail the seas forever.
sooner than you think. Sign the roster.
thanks very much.
how we going? - lncluding those four. that gives us four.
and what's your story?
my story.
lt's exactly the same as your story. just one chapter behind.
l chased a man across the seven seas.
the pursuit cost me my crew.
my commission.
and my life.
Commodore? - No. not any more. Weren't you listening?
l nearly had you all off Tripoli.
l would have. if not for the hurricane.
Lord.
you didn't try to sail through it?
so. do l make your crew or not?
you haven't said where you're going.
somewhere nice?!
so. am l worthy to serve under Captain Jack Sparrow?
or should l just kill you now?
you're hired.
sorry. Old habits and all that.
easy. sailor! - That's our captain you're threatening.
time to go. - Aye!
Thanks. mate.
carry on.
come on. then! Who wants some?
form an orderly line and l'll have you all. one by one.
come on. who's first?
l just wanted the pleasure of doing that myself.
what has the world done to you?
heave!
heave!
heave!
heave!
heave! - Heave!
secure the mast tackle. Mr Turner!
set to it!
step aside. - Hey! Mind yourself!
let go. boy!
no.
haul that weevil to his feet.
five lashes will remind you to stay on them!
No! - lmpeding me in my duties?
you'll share the punishment. - l'll take it all.
will you. now?
and what would prompt such an act of charity?
my son.
he's my son.
what fortuitous circumstance be this?
five lashes be owed. l believe it is.
no. No. l won't!
the cat's out of the bag. Mr Turner.
your issue will feel its sting. be it by the bosun's hand or your own.
no.
Bosun! - No!
you had it easy. boy!
will. - l don't need your help.
the bosun prides himself on cleaving flesh from bone. with every swing.
so l'm to understand what you did was an act of compassion?
Yes.
100 years before the mast. losing who you were. bit by bit.
until you end up... end up like poor Wyvern here.
once you've sworn an oath to the Dutchman. there's no leaving it.
not until your debt is paid.
l've sworn no oath.
you must get away.
not until l find this.
the key.
the dead man's chest.
what do you know of this?
open the chest with the key, and stab the heart...
no, don't stab the heart.
the Dutchman needs a living heart or there'll be no captain, and if there's no captain, there's no one to have the key.
so the captain has the key?
where is the key? - Hidden.
where is the chest? - Hidden.
captain Sparrow!
come to join me crew, lad? Welcome aboard.
l'm here to find the man l love.
l'm deeply flattered, son, but my first and only love is the sea.
meaning William Turner, Captain Sparrow.
hide the rum.
these clothes do not flatter you. lt should be a dress or nothing.
l happen to have no dress in my cabin. - Jack.
l know Will came to find you. Where is he?
darling, l am truly unhappy to have to tell you this, but...
through unfortunate circumstances that had nothing whatsoever to do with me, poor Will has been press-ganged into Davy Jones's crew.
Oh, please.
the captain of the Flying Dutchman?
you look awful. What are you doing here? - You hired me.
l can't help it if your standards are lax.
you smell funny. - Jack!
all l want is to find Will.
are you certain? ls that what you really want most?
of course.
because l would think you'd want to find a way to save Will most.
and you'd have a way of doing that? - Well...
there is a chest. - Oh, dear.
a chest of unknown size and origin.
what contains the still-beating heart of Davy Jones.
and whoever possesses that chest possesses the leverage to command Jones to do whatever it is he or she wants, including saving brave William from his grim fate.
you don't actually believe him, do you?
how would we find it?
with this.
my compass... is unique.
'Unique " here having the meaning of " broken. "
true enough, this compass does not point north.
where does it point?
lt points to the thing you want most in this world.
are you telling the truth? - Every word, love.
and what you want most in this world is to find the chest of Davy Jones, is it not?
to save Will. - By finding the chest of Davy Jones.
Mr. Gibbs! - Cap'n.
we have our heading. - Finally!
cast off those lines. Weigh anchor and crowd that canvas!
miss Swann.
welcome to the crew, former commodore.
there's something to knowing the exact shape of the world and one's place in it.
l assure you, these are not necessary.
l thought you'd be interested in the whereabouts of your daughter.
you have news of her? - Most recently seen on Tortuga, and then left in the company of a known pirate, Jack Sparrow, and other fugitives from justice.
"justice " ? hardly.
lncluding the previous owner of this sword, l believe.
our ships are in pursuit. Justice will be dispensed by cannonade and cutlass, and all manner of remorseless pieces of metal.
l find it distasteful to even contemplate the horror facing all those on board.
what do you want from me?
your authority as governor, your influence in London, and your loyalty to the East lndia Trading Company.
to you, you mean.
shall l remove these shackles?
do what you can for my daughter.
so you see, Mercer, every man has a price he will willingly accept.
even for what he hoped never to sell.
l wager ten years.
cannot say about Jack. but you'll find a ship there.
a ship with black sails.
my brother will take you ashore.
what's wrong? The beach is there.
bon voyage. monsieur.
anybody?
a familiar face.
don't eat me.
l'm not going to eat you. - Don't eat me.
no. Don't eat me.
come on! Who wants it?
l can do this all day!
l can honestly say l'm glad to see you.
Jack. it's me.
tell them to let me down!
Jack. the compass. That's all l need.
Elizabeth is in danger. We were arrested for helping you.
she faces the gallows!
save me.
Jack. what did you tell them?
No!
what about Elizabeth?
that's a good girl. Come a little closer.
we don't bite. - Go on. We won't bite you.
come quickly.
tell me what's happening. - Our name still has some standing.

come on. men! lt'll take all of us to crew the Black Pearl!
actually. you wouldn't need everyone.
about six would do.
Oh. dear.
Hurry! - Come on!
come on! ls that all you got?
wait. Stop.
stop.
what are they doing? - Stop.
snake!
move!
well. go on. go get them.
no. no. No. no!
not good.
cut it loose! Find a rock!
roll the cage!
come on!
lift the cage! Hurry! - Come on. lads. Lift it like a lady's skirt.
run!
this way. lads!
take cover!
stop it!
bugger.
haul loose the mooring line!
the mooring line!
thief! Little hairy thief! Give it back!
don't bite it! - Haul loose the mooring line!
he's got me eye. He won't give it back.
how'd you get it back last time? - Excellent! Our work's half done.
we done it for you. knowing you'd be coming back.
make ready to sail. boys! - What about Jack?
l won't leave without him.
time to go. - Cast off those lines!
make ready to cast off!
good doggy.
alas. my children. this is the day you shall always remember as the day you almost...
captain Jack Sparrow.
let's get away from this island and head out to open sea.
yes to the first. Yes to the second. but only insofar as we keep to the shallows.
that seems a bit contradictory. Captain.
l have faith in your reconciliatory navigational skills.
now. where is that monkey? l want to shoot something.
Jack. Elizabeth is in danger.
have you considered just locking her up somewhere?
she is locked up. bound to hang for helping you.
there comes a time when one must take responsibility for one's mistakes.
l need that compass of yours. Jack.
l must trade it for her freedom.
mr Gibbs. - Captain.
we have a need to travel upriver.
by need. do you mean a trifling need?
fleeting? As in. say. a passing fancy?
no. a resolute and unyielding need.
what we need to do is make sail for Port Royal with all haste.
l shall trade you the compass if you will help me to find this.
you want me to find this? - No.
you want you to find this.
because the finding of this finds you incapacitorially finding and/or locating in your discovering a way to save your dolly belle. ol' what's-her-face.
Savvy?
this is going to save Elizabeth?
how much do you know about Davy Jones?
not much.
Yeah. it's going to save Elizabeth.
what's all this?
lf you both fancy the dress. you'll just have to share and wear it one after the other.
lt's not like that. sir. This ship is haunted.
ls it. now? And you?
there's a female presence amongst us here. sir.
all the men. they can feel it.
searching for her husband. lost at sea.
a virgin too. likely as not.
and that bodes ill by all accounts.
l say that we throw the dress overboard and we hope the spirit follows it.
No! That will just anger the spirit. sir.
what we need to do is find out what the spirit needs. and then get it back to her.
enough! Enough!
you're a pair of superstitious goats and it's got the best of you.
now. this appears to be no more as we have a stowaway on board.
a young woman. by the look of it.
l want you to search the ship and find her.
Oh. and she's probably naked.
why is Jack afraid of the open ocean?
well. if you believe such things.
there's a beast does the bidding of Davy Jones
a fearsome creature with giant tentacles that'll suction your face clean off and drag an entire ship down to the crushing darkness.
the kraken.
they say the stench of its breath is like...
Lmagine. the last thing you know on God's green earth is the roar of the kraken and the reeking odour of a thousand rotting corpses.
lf you believe such things.
and the key will spare him that?
well. that's the very question Jack wants answered.
bad enough even to go visit her.
her?
Aye.
no worries. mates. Tia Dalma and l go way back.
thick as thieves. Nigh inseparable. we are.
were. Have been.
before.
l'll watch your back. - lt's me front l'm worried about.
mind the boat. - Mind the boat.
mind the boat. - Mind the boat.
mind the boat.
mind the boat.
l always knew the wind was going to blow you back to me one day.
you...
you have a touch of destiny about you.
you know me?
you want to know me.
there'll be no knowing here. We've come for help and we're not leaving without it.
l thought l knew you. - Not so well as l had hoped.
come. - Come.
what service may l do you?
you know l demand payment. - l brought payment.
look.
an undead monkey.
top that.
don't! You've no idea how long it took us to catch that.
the payment is fair.
we're looking for this.
and what it goes to.
the compass you bartered from me. it cannot lead you to this?
maybe. Why?
Jack Sparrow does not know what he wants.
or do you know.
but are loath to claim it as your own?
your key go to a chest.
and it is what lay inside the chest you seek. don't it?
what is inside? - Gold?
jewels? Unclaimed properties of a valuable nature?
nothing bad. l hope?
you know of Davy Jones.
yes?
a man of the sea.
a great sailor.
until he run afoul of that which vex all men.
what vexes all men?
what indeed?
the sea. - Sums.
the dichotomy of good and evil.
a woman.
a woman.
he fell in love.
no. no. no. no. l heard it was the sea he fell in love with.
same story. different versions. and all are true.
see. it was a woman as changing and harsh and untamable as the sea.
him never stopped loving her.
but the pain it cause him was too much to live with but not enough to cause him to die.
what exactly did he put into the chest?
him heart.
literally or figuratively?
he couldn't literally put his heart in a chest.
could he?
lt was not worth feeling what small. fleeting joy life brings.
and so him carve out him heart.
lock it away in a chest and hide the chest from the world.
the key he keep with him at all times.
you knew this. - l did not. l didn't know where the key was.
but now we do. All that's left is to climb aboard the Flying Dutchman. grab the key.
you go back to Port Royal and save your bonnie lass. eh?
let me see your hand.
the black spot!
the black spot! - Black spot!
my eyesight's as good as ever. just so you know.
l have just the thing. Now. where did l put it?
my little beauty. where are you?
such a long time in such a mess.
Davy Jones cannot make port.
cannot step on land but once every ten years.
land is where you are safe. Jack Sparrow.
and so you will carry land with you.
dirt.
this is a jar of dirt. - Yes.
ls the jar of dirt going to help?
lf you don't want it. give it back.
no. - Then it helps.
lt seems we have a need to find the Flying Dutchman.
a touch of destiny.
that's the Flying Dutchman?
she doesn't look like much. - Neither do you.
do not underestimate her.
must have run afoul of the reef. - So. what's your plan. then?
l row over. search the ship until l find your bloody key.
and if there are crewmen?
l cut down anyone in my path.
l like it. Simple. easy to remember.
your chariot awaits you. Sire.
lf you do happen to get captured. just say Jack Sparrow sent you to settle his debt.
lt might save your life. - Bon voyage!
douse the lamps.
sailor.
hoisting the jib. Captain's orders. - Sailor!
hoisting the jib. Bring up with a round turn.
there's no use. You've run aground.
no.
beneath us.
foul breath.
down on your marrowbones and pray.
get back! Get back!
five men still alive. The rest have moved on.
do you fear death?
do you fear that dark abyss?
all your deeds laid bare.
all your sins punished.
l can offer you an escape.
don't listen to him!
do you not fear death?
l'll take my chances. sir.
to the depths.
cruel blackguard!
life is cruel.
why should the afterlife be any different?
l offer you a choice.
join my crew and postpone the judgment.
one hundred years before the mast.
will ye serve?
l will serve.
you are neither dead nor dying.
what is your purpose here?
Jack Sparrow sent me to settle his debt.
what is your purpose here?
Jack Sparrow sent me to settle his debt.
did he. now?
l'm sorely tempted to accept that offer.
you have a debt to pay.
you've been captain of the Black Pearl for 1 3 years.
that was our agreement.
technically l was only captain for two years. then l was mutinied upon.
then you were a poor captain. but a captain nonetheless.
have you not introduced yourself all these years as Captain Jack Sparrow?
you have my payment. One soul to serve on your ship.
one soul is not equal to another.
we've established my proposal is sound in principle. Now we're haggling over price.
price?
just how many souls do you think my soul is worth?
one hundred souls.
three days.
you're a diamond. mate. Send me back the boy. l'll get started right off.
l keep the boy. A good-faith payment.
that leaves you only 99 more to go.
have you not met Will Turner?
he's noble. heroic. a terrific soprano.
worth at least four.
maybe three and a half.
and did l happen to mention he's in love?
with a girl.
due to be married.
betrothed.
dividing him from her and her from him would only be half as cruel as actually allowing them to be joined in holy matrimony. Eh?
l keep the boy. 99 souls.
but l wonder. Sparrow.
can you live with this?
can you condemn an innocent man. a friend.
to a lifetime of servitude in your name while you roam free?
Yep. l'm good with it.
shall we seal it in blood? l mean ink.
three days.
three days.
mr Gibbs. - Aye.
l feel sullied and unusual.
and how do you intend to harvest these 99 souls in three days?
fortunately. he was mum as to the condition in which these souls need be.
Tortuga.
Tortuga.
lt's an outrage. Port tariffs. berthing fees.
wharf handling and. heaven help us. pilotage.
are we all to work for the East lndia Trading Company. then?
l'm afraid. sir. Tortuga is the only free port left in these waters.
a pirate port is what you mean. Well. l'm sorry.
an honest sailor is what l am. l make my living fair and l sleep well each night.
sir!
she wants you to do something.
she's trying to give a sign.
over there! Look for a sign!
look. there! There it is!
there's the sign! - That's seaweed.
seaweed can be a sign. - Looks like entrails.
that would be a bad sign. - What's that over there?
and what makes you think you're worthy to crew the Black Pearl?
l've never sailed a day in me life.
l figure l should get out. see the world while l'm still young.
you'll do. Make your mark. Next!
my wife ran off with my dog and l'm drunk for a month and l don't give an ass rat's if l live or die.
perfect. Next! - l know what l want. l know what l want...
me have one arm and a bum leg. - lt's the crow's nest for you.
l know what l want. - Next!
ever since l was a little lad. l've always wanted to sail the seas forever.
sooner than you think. Sign the roster.
thanks very much.
how we going? - lncluding those four. that gives us four.
and what's your story?
my story.
lt's exactly the same as your story. just one chapter behind.
l chased a man across the seven seas.
the pursuit cost me my crew.
my commission.
and my life.
Commodore? - No. not any more. Weren't you listening?
l nearly had you all off Tripoli.
l would have. if not for the hurricane.
Lord.
you didn't try to sail through it?
so. do l make your crew or not?
you haven't said where you're going.
somewhere nice?!
so. am l worthy to serve under Captain Jack Sparrow?
or should l just kill you now?
you're hired.
sorry. Old habits and all that.
easy. sailor! - That's our captain you're threatening.
time to go. - Aye!
Thanks. mate.
carry on.
come on. then! Who wants some?
form an orderly line and l'll have you all. one by one.
come on. who's first?
l just wanted the pleasure of doing that myself.
what has the world done to you?
heave!
heave!
heave!
heave!
heave! - Heave!
secure the mast tackle. Mr Turner!
set to it!
step aside. - Hey! Mind yourself!
let go. boy!
no.
haul that weevil to his feet.
five lashes will remind you to stay on them!
No! - lmpeding me in my duties?
you'll share the punishment. - l'll take it all.
will you. now?
and what would prompt such an act of charity?
my son.
he's my son.
what fortuitous circumstance be this?
five lashes be owed. l believe it is.
no. No. l won't!
the cat's out of the bag. Mr Turner.
your issue will feel its sting. be it by the bosun's hand or your own.
no.
Bosun! - No!
you had it easy. boy!
will. - l don't need your help.
the bosun prides himself on cleaving flesh from bone. with every swing.
so l'm to understand what you did was an act of compassion?
Yes.
100 years before the mast. losing who you were. bit by bit.
until you end up... end up like poor Wyvern here.
once you've sworn an oath to the Dutchman. there's no leaving it.
not until your debt is paid.
l've sworn no oath.
you must get away.
not until l find this.
the key.
the dead man's chest.
what do you know of this?
open the chest with the key, and stab the heart...
no, don't stab the heart.
the Dutchman needs a living heart or there'll be no captain, and if there's no captain, there's no one to have the key.
so the captain has the key?
where is the key? - Hidden.
where is the chest? - Hidden.
captain Sparrow!
come to join me crew, lad? Welcome aboard.
l'm here to find the man l love.
l'm deeply flattered, son, but my first and only love is the sea.
meaning William Turner, Captain Sparrow.
hide the rum.
these clothes do not flatter you. lt should be a dress or nothing.
l happen to have no dress in my cabin. - Jack.
l know Will came to find you. Where is he?
darling, l am truly unhappy to have to tell you this, but...
through unfortunate circumstances that had nothing whatsoever to do with me, poor Will has been press-ganged into Davy Jones's crew.
Oh, please.
the captain of the Flying Dutchman?
you look awful. What are you doing here? - You hired me.
l can't help it if your standards are lax.
you smell funny. - Jack!
all l want is to find Will.
are you certain? ls that what you really want most?
of course.
because l would think you'd want to find a way to save Will most.
and you'd have a way of doing that? - Well...
there is a chest. - Oh, dear.
a chest of unknown size and origin.
what contains the still-beating heart of Davy Jones.
and whoever possesses that chest possesses the leverage to command Jones to do whatever it is he or she wants, including saving brave William from his grim fate.
you don't actually believe him, do you?
how would we find it?
with this.
my compass... is unique.
'Unique " here having the meaning of " broken. "
true enough, this compass does not point north.
where does it point?
lt points to the thing you want most in this world.
are you telling the truth? - Every word, love.
and what you want most in this world is to find the chest of Davy Jones, is it not?
to save Will. - By finding the chest of Davy Jones.
Mr. Gibbs! - Cap'n.
we have our heading. - Finally!
cast off those lines. Weigh anchor and crowd that canvas!
miss Swann.
welcome to the crew, former commodore.
there's something to knowing the exact shape of the world and one's place in it.
l assure you, these are not necessary.
l thought you'd be interested in the whereabouts of your daughter.
you have news of her? - Most recently seen on Tortuga, and then left in the company of a known pirate, Jack Sparrow, and other fugitives from justice.
"justice " ? hardly.
lncluding the previous owner of this sword, l believe.
our ships are in pursuit. Justice will be dispensed by cannonade and cutlass, and all manner of remorseless pieces of metal.
l find it distasteful to even contemplate the horror facing all those on board.
what do you want from me?
your authority as governor, your influence in London, and your loyalty to the East lndia Trading Company.
to you, you mean.
shall l remove these shackles?
do what you can for my daughter.
so you see, Mercer, every man has a price he will willingly accept.
even for what he hoped never to sell.
l wager ten years.
do what you can for my daughter.
so you see, Mercer, every man has a price he will willingly accept.
even for what he hoped never to sell.
l wager ten years.
14 years ago
I won't.
I can't.
is this the one, Father?
could it finally be over?
we can but pray, Mrs. O'Connor.
how are we doing?
she's very nervous, Father. Shhh, Mrs. Flynn.
everything's going to be just fine.
but I can't, Father.
I won't.
I don't want to know.
let's not interfere with what the Good Lord has planned for us.
you and your husband are good people.
you have nothing to fear.
is it a boy?
can I see it?
I want to see it.
I think it's best not, Mrs. Flynn...under the circumstances.
I have to see it.
michael tell him.
tell him I have to see it.
he's a creature of God, Father.
I don't think so, Mrs. Flynn.
with all this take up the shield of faith, with which you will be enabled to put out all the flames of the wicked enemy.
forgive me, Father.
but if we keep blaming the children, what are we?
no more.
no more, Father!
it's not their fault, Father.
shut him up.
it's time to accept our lot, Father.
no more.
dad.
are your roots in a specific location or are they just scattered around this barren wasteland?
still blocking her out?
blocking who out?
because if this is it then I think I've seen enough and I'm ready to go back to town.
Jess, are you capable of having a single unexpressed thought?
there went one.
anyway, it's not just about roots, it's about spending time as a family.
I remember there was definitely an idyllic spot around here somewhere.
what, like a city of some kind?
here they are, the ruins.
perfect. Let's go.
hiking to ruins.
great.
I've got to be honest,
I don't think there's much to see out here, Dr. Monohan.
don't get me wrong, it's beautiful out here and everything.
but there isn't really anything to do.
you could have just stayed in England.
plenty to do there, I'm sure.
hang on a minute, it's you lot that never venture outside your own country, not us.
everything we need's right here.
I mean you're not exactly admired for your knowledge of foreign affairs, are you?
that's a bit of a generalization, don't you think?
in Europe it's different.
we like to make a point of exploring and understanding other cultures and that...
even if they're still in the dark ages.
not that we're in a complete vacuum.
the cities are a stellar places to meet new and interesting people...
isn't that right, Jessie?
knowing Jessie for three days hardly gives you the authority to start throwing around adjectives like "interesting," now does it?
getting a chill?
it's fucking freezing out here.
warm me up.
I'm starting to reconsider our allowing him to come along.
weren't you the one who thought it might appease Jessica?
it's actually thanks to your dad that I went into the whole child psych area.
yeah I know, I've heard the fairy tale already.
kind of lonely out here, dad.
it's unspoiled.
I could see us settling down in a country cottage here.
fireplace burning, a bottle of wine...
and nothing but each other to keep us warm.
got any gum?
yeah... sorry.
it's in there someplace. Just take it.
I don't think we're going the right way.
sounds like the navigation's going real well.
you should let Robin take a look.
this is tough enough, Jessica.
just pitching in for the family unit, Annette.
Hey, look.
let me talk to him, Dr. M.
I'll soon have this problem sorted out.
now remember, Americans, you're in a foreign land and representing your country.
so you need to act with dignity and respect.
excuse me?
how are you doing?
you lost, are you?
not lost exactly.
do you speak Gaelic?
Yes. Gaelic, of course.
these people are Americans.
if you come with me
I'll take you to a place where it's warm and dry.
then you can get the bus in the morning.
Thanks. We really need to get back tonight.
Hey. Sir.
you'll be better off with me.
I think we'll take our chances.
we're here.
Really?
Why?
I don't know. Instinct, I guess.
Jess, can you put him down for a minute and come eat lunch?
it really is too cold for this and it stinks in here.
Yeah, there's definitely a bit of a nasty funk in the air, that's for sure.
not quite as idyllic as you may remember, eh, Dr. M?
what's in this?
corned beef and cabbage.
bit of a cliche, but it doesn't look too bad actually.
Mmm. Nice, Annette. Cheers.
can I have a water, please?
so, now that we have a minute...
here we go. ...We would like to discuss a date.
do we have to wear, like, real bridesmaids dresses?
ha, Molly in a dress. That's gonna be awesome.
turning our discussion to more important things...
when we get back to the hotel, I want my own room.
you can share a room with your sister.
you don't get much chance to spend time together anymore.
that's completely intentional.
perhaps not now, Jerry.
excuse me. I'm talking to my father.
Jessica!
I'm sorry, Annette, but your little attempt to play happy family vacation by having a nice picnic here has fallen a bit flat due to the fact that I'm freezing my ass off and it smells like shit out here.
not exactly a Hallmark moment.
Jess, why do you always have to be such a fucking cunt?
fuck you!
break it up, you two.
us two? She's the one who called me a cunt.
you've still got serious mental problems, you know!
OK. That's a little below the belt, kid.
I'll be sure to register your complaint with my actual mother.
Jessica! There's just no need to be so selfish.
don't tell me what to do you little psycho!
dad! Enough.
Molly needs to switch her meds again!
I said enough.
this whole trip is fucked!
Jess, you dropped the theater minor, remember? I'll go.
I can't understand why the hell anyone would want to come out here anyway.
can you keep your mouth shut for more than five seconds?
don't even talk to me, Molly.
you're chemically imbalanced and completely irrational.
permission to speak freely, Dr. M?
permission granted.
well, I'm just speaking as an observer-like, but there seem to be some issues going on here.
Robin, I want to make something clear.
Yes, Jerry?
this trip was supposed to be about the new family unit.
you know? Kinda a bonding thing?
Jessica's impulsive invitation to you
she's impulsive, alright.
well, now that you're along for the ride,
I'd appreciate a little bit more of an effort on your part.
an attempt to blend in.
the girls are supposed to be getting to know Annette, not random Englishmen.
and if I were you, newly arrived in the middle of some decades-old family tension,
I'd probably just try to sit on the sidelines with my beer, and keep my opinions to myself.
why are you such a bitch?
go to hell
that went well.
let's get the fuck away from these freaks.
Jessica!
Jessica!
Jessica!
that's it.
when we get back, you're staying in.
that's if we get back, considering the fact that the last bus is in about 5 minutes.
what?
wait!
wait!
stop!
do we go back to the barn?
at least it has a roof.
or let's find the farmer who took a shine to Molly.
it might be a match made in heaven.
one more word out of you, Jessica...
and what?
do you think it was my idea to come out here?
we may as well start walking.
there's nothing here.
everyone in favor of heading for the only sign of civilization?
you alright, Dr. M?
you look a bit tired, mate.
just fine, Rob.
he's just pissed, that's all.
the running's aggravated his back.
I think I've known my Dad a bit longer than you, Annette.
enough.
Annette, do we have to call you "mom" after you're married?
you can call me whatever you think is appropriate young lady.
I mean, it seems a bit weird seeing as you're not that much older than me.
don't start, Jessica.
you're physically incapable... Everyone just calm down.
shit! Did you fucking see that?
what's wrong? Emergency. Get the meds!
I'm completely serious. I saw something.
what?
something fucked, like a kid or something.
you're fucked, you little bitch. Fuck you.
dad, how come I can't spontaneously hallucinate like Molly?
that's it! Leave your sister alone!
I don't give a shit what she says.
I'm telling you, believe me, I saw something.
weird.
what's weird?
a French car.
with a roof full of luggage.
parked in the middle of nowhere.
and it's unlocked.
at least it's shelter.
get comfortable, this is where we're kipping.
unless there's some sort of Holiday Inn around the corner, eh,
Dr. M?
the light could at least be a house of some sort.
I'll go and check it out.
I don't know about this.
once those kick in, I'll be fine.
no need to hang about.
I'll go now.
you lot sit tight.
I'm coming with you.
Oh no.
no way.
I want to go with him.
what if something happens? It's better if there's two of us.
look, Jess, it could be dangerous.
but you go for it, Robin.
be back in a tic, mate.
Thanks.
what?
do you hear anything weird?
Yeah.
your voice.
you know what? Screw you and fuck this!
Jessica!
ow my fucking back!
watch that cursing!
let her go, honey.
no one in their right mind would mess with her.
never again. Never again.
next time she's staying home.
can we discuss this in the car?
I mean, who is this Robin guy anyway?
Robin!
wait!
alright, darling?
put your arm around me right now!
I'm telling you I saw something weird back there.
Molly, it was just an animal of some sort.
I don't think it was an animal.
let's just stick with the positive thoughts until Jessica and Robin get back.
I swear this is how it's been for the entire week.
total torture.
I've seen worse.
I'll tell you what though.
your little sister's got a bit of a mental problem.
she doesn't mean it.
it's just her disturbed personality.
gets it from Mom.
I'm telling you.
I once went out with this girl, nothing serious or anything, we were just having a laugh.
but we'd be down the pub or whatever and she'd get in these moods where she'd just start staring into nothing like she was in a trance.
I'm like, "Hello? Anybody home?"
nothing.
and it'd take her a while to snap out of it.
she didn't even know she was doing it.
so what happened?
everybody thought I was poking a nutter.
like, "what is going on, darling?"
to be honest I didn't understand a word of that but it sounds like you dumped her for staring.
you're a tough taskmaster.
that's right.
and don't you forget it.
it's like when you're camping and, you know, you start telling ghost stories by the fire and you end up scaring yourselves more than any actual outside threat ever could.
your imagination just has a way of going to some dark places.
it wasn't my imagination.
I'm not saying that it was.
it's just best not to dwell on the unknown in situations like this, we'll end up scaring each other out of our wits.
we'll be laughing about this tomorrow when we're in a nice, warm pub somewhere.
let's get back in the car.
Yeah, it's really cold.
right.
let's hope someone's home.
and they've got a phone.
I'll get someone from my dad's company to send us a car.
make it two.
Hello?
it's open.
we can't just go in, can we?
stay behind me.
someone's obviously been here.
no kidding, Einstein.
Hey.
we may as well make the most of our time alone.
here?
why not?
it's almost too romantic.
come on, just a quick one.
I don't think so.
whatever.
Hello?
there's someone out there.
what are you doing?
I should go after them.
dad, please.
it's not ideal circumstances under which to leave two ladies alone especially after Molly saw the ghoul back there.
thanks for taking me seriously, Annette.
are we even walking towards the guy?
how do we know?
we don't, really.
Hello?
Ah, there! Alright!
wait!
keep up!
Robin.
Robin?
Robin?
Jesus.
you could have waited for me, asshole.
don't worry, sweetheart. I grew up around these guys.
they're good people.
alright?
to be honest, we're a bit stranded.
we sort of need a phone.
you alone?
we missed the last bus home.
the others are up by the road.
the others?
the whole family's up there.
you'd better come with me, now.
I'll go for the others in a while.
come with you where exactly?
Jess.
you'd better come with me, sweetheart.
I'd hate to see you go to waste.
what did he just say? I think we'll be going.
you need to come with me.
don't you fucking touch her!
I could do with both of you.
but I'll settle for one.
don't even think about following us, geezer!
I don't want to hurt you.
it's for the best. You'll understand.
stop!
for your own good, stop!
you two stay put and lock the doors.
I told you two to stay in the god damn car!
we should stick together. This is bad enough, Jerry.
lock the doors.
and if another car comes by flag it down like your life depended on it.
not a whole lot of traffic here, dad.
you're being irrational. Please don't go.
get back in the car and lock the doors. Now!
I don't want to hurt you.
stop, for your own good, stop.
you'll understand.
I don't want to hurt you.
they'll find you.
mark my words they'll find you.
you're better off with me.
okay, have it your way but they'll find you.
Jessica!
I'll bet Dr. Gerald's really winning you over with this trip.
having second thoughts?
I'll just be happy when we are all safely back here, together.
I've a sad feeling we could be waiting a while.
Molly, what could possibly have happened?
I didn't mean to startle you.
are your parents around?
Thanks.
did you hear that?
what?
Shh!
Molly, stop it please.
Molly.
what is that?
do you hear it?
sounds like crying or something.
I don't like this.
dad!
Jessica!
it's just the wind blowing.
must be.
okay.
let's get back in the car.
no matter how bad we both want to go after them, we're the only point of reference for Jerry, your sister, and Robin.
I'm going to try and get some sleep.
Yeah.
me, too.
you fucking bastard!
you can't stay here, young seed.
who are you?
I'm Sheila.
ROSEMARY'S grandmother.
you'd better come with me.
wait.
don't go.
what the hell is that?
please let me... Please let me go.
get the fuck away from me!
go!
think of it like the rabbits.
once upon a time, the rabbits all got sick...
...and they bred and they bred and before long the sickness was just a cold memory.
I should check to see if Rosemary is up and about.
rosemary?
ah look at you.
you've been hurt.
badly hurt.
I was shot.
get away.
near here?
were you interferin' in other peoples' business?
I was with someone.
some people.
we were in a car, I think.
now let's not be silly.
you should sit yourself down.
sounds like you've not been playing fair with the other children.
sit down and I'll see if Rosemary's ready to come out yet.
no, I don't think you understand.
I need to get help.
don't talk silly.
a nice sit-down is what you need.
you see, Rosemary's very shy around outsiders.
they all are.
you can't blame them.
you mustn't force it.
she needs to come round of her own accord.
I don't know a Rosemary.
all I know is that I need to call the police.
Oh listen to you.
what sort of silly talk is that about people getting shot?
a nice cup of tea is what you need.
where are we?
I need a telephone.
I can tell by looking at you that you're not from around here.
in these parts, guests have a little more respect for their hosts.
respect?
it's called manners.
Oh they're just excited.
you know children.
they get jealous.
I'll go and see if Rosemary is ready.
dad!
Jessica!
honestly, that granddaughter of mine.
bone idle sometimes, I'll tell you.
here she comes.
come and sit down, my dear, and meet our guest, a clean seed from the outside.
you'll be happy to know that she's of that age.
there's no need to be afraid.
it's with the help of outsiders like yourself that we can rid our town of its peculiarities.
the children are restless tonight.
of course, they're very protective.
they don't trust outsiders.
you can understand it.
nobody wants to be taken away from their homes, and their families.
listen to me.
who's for biscuits?
now you two get to know each another.
I'll go... well...
and don't worry, she's a good girl and she's of that age.
please stop, please.
I really have to go and find the others.
you, young man, should learn a bit of courtesy.
I really don't mean to be rude.
there.
I'm sorry to disappoint you, dear.
it won't be tonight.
we've got one!
we've got one!
he's here!
we've got one!
we've got one!
he's here!
he's here!
we've got one!
he's here！
we've got one...
he's here!
he's here!
he's getting away.
he's getting away!
catch him!
he's getting away!
catch him!
catch him!
catch him!
please don't kill me. Please.
please. I'll do anything. Please.
people are looking for me.
please stop, please.
you little, fucking shit!
sorry I called you a cunt.
I deserved it.
Where's Dad?
don't know.
he went looking for you.
Annette?
dead.
Robin?
dead.
we need to get away from here now.
but which way?
do you hear that?
we need to use a phone!
answer me!
you've got to help us!
can you hear me?
anybody! Please can you help us?
hello.
I'm going to break this Goddamn window if you don't answer me.
look.
what about the keys?
could they be in the ignition?
knock on the door.
open it.
come on. They could be anywhere.
let's check the other rooms.
I'll take the upstairs.
we are not splitting up.
like you said, they could be anywhere.
if you see anyone that looks even slightly fucked up, use that thing.
what are you doing here?
you must leave.
we need car keys.
we? Who else is here?
my sister.
she's downstairs. And she's armed too.
they'll be home any minute now.
the psycho kids?
it's not the kids you need to be worried about.
I'm not going outside without car keys.
you stand a better chance out there.
calm down. Now, everything's going to be alright.
well done, Agnes.
you got the other one.
I felt for sure the kids had got them all.
what have you lot been up to?
I'll deal with you later.
kids.
the car was just sitting there at the side of the road.
and this lot thought it would be a good place to bunk down.
two, maybe three clean folks gone.
of all the foul luck.
there we go.
Ah, don't be soft. It's clean.
we've tried it and we've tried it.
it's no use.
he's right, Agnes, we don't want to take any chances.
take me with away. Please!
Agnes.
Agnes.
come on. Agnes.
what's the hold up?
get in.
what's the quickest way out of here?
the bridge.
the road will lead you all the way out of town.
turn right up here.
fuck.
look out!
nice.
keep going.
nice work.
Thanks.
Oh, no.
what's wrong? Go.
I can't it won't move.
No! Jessica! No!
there's a problem with the car.
it's not possible. The car's running fine.
there's definitely a problem, listen...
how long have you been here?
it's hard to say.
we're not the only ones, we know that.
they say they've been trying to cleanse for years.
cleanse?
this is my third.
their plan hasn't worked so far but they'll keep trying or so they tell us.
no.
they can't be.
I'd rather die!
are you decent in there?
everyone in the back, into the kitchen. - Excuse me?
let's go, move! - Ok, all right.
Mr. Gazi, I was just about to call you.
I talked to Raman, he said I have more time. That's not what he told me.
wait, wait, wait. Hold on, hold on, no! Wait! No!
C'mon, don't do this. Please.
calm down, just... You don't have to do this, all right?
I can get you the money. Just give me one more day.
good run? - Jesus!
you scared the hell out of me.
you have any idea how easy it is to get in here?
you should try locking your door for starters. Yeah, yeah.
what's going on? Rebecca called an early briefing.
you weren't picking up so... I decided to come by.
you thinking about putting some furniture in this place?
I got the important stuff. How long have you been here, four months?
six and a half. - Six and a half months?
and you have one plant, and you killed it.
look at that. Look, it's a metaphor.
just because you're divorced doesn't mean you have to live like a slob.
separated. All right? There's a big difference.
all right. I'm just saying, John.
this isn't a home, it's depressing.
does Emily stay here? Where... where does she sleep?
alright. That's enough, okay. I'm going to have a shower.
make yourself some coffee, if you want. - All right.
Hey, look at this. - Who's that?
he's been cracking her up for the last twenty minutes.
you have any idea who that guy is? None.
...they're pointed at you, so...
all I remember is you were a sloppy drunk.
I was an exceptional drunk. - Oh. Okay, I remember it.
that you... uh, I remember shots of tequila lined up.
I remember, correct me if I'm wrong, lime green underwear.
more of a minty green. - Oh, I see.
I do remember you drinking me under the table, though.
what's this, an early briefing?
John, there you are, good.
this is Marcus Jakes, he's a U. C. - Right.
Hey. John Moreland, in the flesh.
the stories I hear about you, brother. - How you doing?
Jakes and I were in uniform together. Same division.
small world.
I used to make her laugh so hard that coffee would shoot out her nose.
she still do that?
all the time. - Okay. So. Briefing.
right. - Yeah.
ali Raman, runs a protection racket.
illegal gambling, torture, murder.
he's got an underground fight club, it's pretty intense.
Yeah, I've heard of this guy, he's a borderline psychopath.
Jakes has been deep undercover.
eight months. - Cool.
my path into Raman's operation has been through his lieutenant. A guy named Ric Gazi.
Oh. Look at that. - It's magic.
OK, I'm in deep with Gazi... Worked my way onto his crew.
and you've been doing what?
you know, collections. Trashing stores, intimidating folks, that kind of thing.
I could arrest Gazi right now, but he is not my focus.
I want this guy. I want Raman, I want the boss.
major Crimes is asking us to help out. - Why, where's your handler?
the handler was Stu Crowder, he's out of the picture.
out of the picture, what does that suppose to mean?
what happened to him? Uh, whiskey...
...happened to him. Followed by gin, followed by paint thinner, if that's what he had around. After a while he just stopped checking in.
I'd called for surveillance, and backup, I get nothing.
I was completely on my own.
so, what can we do for you, Mr. Jakes?
my boy Gazi, he's got ambitions.
he's wants to take out Raman. He's planning a hit.
we can't let that happen.
so we're going to get in front of it. - Mh-hmm...
you are going to be my old friend John the hit-man.
I'm going to introduce you to Gazi.
you're gonna meet him, you're gonna talk to him, you're gonna take the contract.
and then we pick him up. - Conspiracy to murder, that's big.
Yeah, I need him out of the way. I need a clear shot at his boss.
I want Raman in prison, not dead.
alright, listen up. Our first step... Just wait a second.
how do you know about this hit he's got planned? - He told me.
so you didn't offer?
no, of course not.
what's your point?
my point is, is just I want to know what I'm walking myself into here.
make sure this meet is clean.
relax. I know what I'm doing. The job is solid.
Jesse, you'll cover things from the inside, you'll be a fighter, training at Raman's club.
you'll be our eyes in there.
I'm going to have to wire you.
with what you're wearing, I'm gonna have to do your chest.
can you take your shirt off? - Yeah.
are you kidding me?
what?
nothing.
come here.
Gazi will be at the club, that's where he does business.
Jakes, you're gonna walk John inside, introduce him. We'll be recording everything.
as soon as Gazi offers John the contract, we got him.
alright, they just came in.
Jesse, make sure you keep them in sight. - Copy that.
on the face of it is completely legit, but after hours it's a whole different thing.
the gloves come off, bare knuckle fights. A lot of gambling, a lot of blood.
they never get shut down? - No, never.
raman knows exactly who to pay off, and exactly how much.
the guy in there right now, the guy behind me, green shirt, that's the trainer Duffy, Eli Duff. He runs all the fighters.
every single one of them does double duty as enforcers. The kid in there with him, that's Gavin.
if you don't pay your debt, he comes by, he breaks your arms.
OK.
so, over there. That's my guy Gazi,
Raman's second in command.
he wants Raman gone so he can take over the whole operation.
he's a little paranoid, so don't take it personally.
well, he's planning to kill his boss, I'd be paranoid too.
they're approaching Gazi. - There he is.
what... whoa, wait, wait, wait for it, wait.
chewy says he's sorry, won't be late again.
don't say I never gave you nothing.
Oh, this is my friend. This is the guy.
the guy I told you about. - How you doing? John.
he does the thing, the service.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
what did I tell you? He hates new people, this guy.
Gazi, we had the conversation, you wanted to meet a guy, now you're meeting him.
what's happening? - I don't know. Looks like a standoff.
you're imagining things, my friend. You need to walk away right now.
I told him this was a bad idea.
he's got zero judgment, this guy. - What are you talking about?
you think he's going to discuss business in front of all these people? Come on.
apologize. Come on, let's go.
you're killing me here, you know that?
tell him we're gonna meet somewhere else. Brickworks, north side.
Yes. - In the parking lot.
alright that'll work, that's good. I'll ask him.
Brickworks, north side, parking lot.
be there in twenty minutes, your last chance.
alright, they're on their way out.
when we're going to wait here in the car. Let Gazi come to us.
when he comes in, let him drive the conversation.
don't lead him, alright? - All right.
Maria and Danny are going to be at 2 o'clock running spin.
what's he thinking with these tinted windows, how are we going to see Gazi when he's in the backseat?
Rebecca will be in the lot behind us. She'll have eyes on the entrance.
here's Rebecca.
OK, she's in position.
it's good to see Rebecca, she looks good.
you two getting along? - Most of the time.
Yeah, she takes a while that one.
you two will be fine.
she's worth it. She's one of a kind, seriously.
the best cop I've ever known.
John, Gazi's approaching the entrance.
get ready.
we got eyes.
OK, here he is. We're good, Gazi's alone.
John, do you have a clear view? - Yeah, we're good.
what is he doing? - Is he gonna get out?
relax. He's just being cautious.
come on, Gazi.
alright, here we go.
shots fired, Rebecca. - Where's... where's the shooter?
there he is, by the warehouse. - Daniel, stay with him.
I got him. I got him, he's headed south. We're in pursuit.
shots fired. Brickworks, north side parking lot, send an ambulance.
alright, hold on.
all I'm saying is this whole thing is based on Jakes' information.
Jakes' judgment, all right?
if he was doing his job, he would have known about the hit.
but you're not placing blame. - No I'm not placing blame.
Rebecca, wait, okay?
I've worked with guys like this before, all right?
if Gazi was exposed... he should have been on top of that...
he didn't know it was going to happen, John. You would have made the same call.
I know this guy's a friend of yours, all right, but maybe you've got a blind spot for this guy. Do you ever think of that?
he's a good cop, you need to back off.
Ric Gazi was DOA at Mount Sinai.
homicide wants you to call.
I'm sure they do.
you're gonna have to give a full statement. We all are.
shooter? - He got away.
I had no idea guys, I swear to God.
so, what happened. Raman caught wind of the hit?
found out his boy's coming after him, got there first?
Yeah, must have been. - Could have been a pre-emptive strike.
it means you might be done, Jakes. Too bad. That's eight months work down the drain.
or maybe it works in my favor.
it's an opportunity, maybe it's a chance to move up.
how do you figure that?
you're one of Gazi's boys, Raman's going to smell you a mile away.
all I gotta do is make a move, guys.
I just gotta send a message. Show Raman that I'm loyal, that I wasn't involved.
John could be right. You could be next in line for a bullet.
and if my guys are with you, they're in danger too.
we need to make sure Jakes is safe. That's our next move.
we could put Jesse in as a fighter slash enforcer, maybe?
he's already been in the club. He's established.
Yeah, he could be looking for extra cash. Jakes, you can walk him in, make the intro.
he could be one of your boys. It'll give us a sense.
if anyone looks at you sideways, Jakes, that's it, we're out.
copy that. Kid, I hope you know how to fight.
raw talent, quick learner.
you need a guy to do collections, he can do that too.
you said you were looking for new people. How you doing?
Where'd you find him? - This girl I know, he's her kid brother.
she's insane, she thinks he's the next big thing.
maybe she's right.
Yeah, listen kid, this is Duffy, you do exactly what he says, all right?
Yeah.
throw him in there with Gavin, see what he does.
first spar doesn't go to one of my boys.
it goes to me.
good luck, kid.
alright, here we go.
take it easy on him, Duff.
come on, Jesse, here we go, make this count.
keep it together. Let's go, let's go.
watch his feet, c'mon.
that's it, that's it, wait for an opening.
that's alright, you got this, c'mon!
shake it off.
come on, stay on him. Let's go, let's go.
alright, Duffy, I think you made your point.
alright, you can let him up I think. He can't breathe.
let him up, man. What are you doing?
your boy's okay. Tell him to come see me later.
you made the right choice, by the way.
you had a front cross. You saw it, but you didn't take it.
you let Duffy smoke you. - You noticed?
I did the same thing, my first time.
you're gonna do just fine here.
come on.
What'd I tell you? I'm safe, we're good to go.
what have you got? - All right. Bear with me.
raman is in the business, among other things, of collecting debts, right?
and sometimes he buys a debt from someone else.
for example, you're a gambler. You're Gambler Dan.
and you owe John here, two-fifty, three hundred grand. You're not paying.
and Gentleman John here is an old friend of mine from way back, you know, he's not a violent man.
he can't go around breaking people's fingers, he doesn't have the stomach for it.
so I bring Raman the debt, and he buys it for, say, I don't know, 50 grand.
he's like a collection agent.
now Gambler Dan owes him. And if he doesn't pay, his legs get broken.
but we've already established, John as a hit-man.
but no one knows that.
they only saw him in the club. So why was he in the club?
you were introducing him to Gazi. - Right.
because of the debt Gazi was going to buy. And now that Gazi's dead...
you're going to take it all the way up to Raman.
yes... This is the move I've been waiting to make.
raman goes after gambler Dan...
and just as he's about to break some fingers...
in comes the dream team. Guns a'blazin. Ready to make some arrests.
loan sharking, extortion, assault.
guys, what do you think?
it's not terrible.
thoughts?
let's do it. Let's take it for a spin.
yes?
this is John Bain.
pleasure. Please sit.
Marcus, has told me about your predicament.
I love my sister.
only she has terrible taste in men.
he's a gambler, they were together for two years.
he stole three hundred thousand from her.
and when she found out, he became very violent.
he almost killed her.
and now you want your money back.
I want him to pay.
I want your personal attention on this. I hear you're the best.
can you do it?
possibly.
I'll need time to have Gavin check him out.
whatever you need. He lives at 19 West Elm Street.
John has a special request.
go ahead.
I want to be there when you do it.
when you collect.
I want to look into his eyes, when you're making him pay.
Hey. John asked me to check into Jakes' files.
Really?
Yeah, and I think we might have a problem.
so I've been pulling all of Jakes' case work from the last eight months. And it's full of holes.
I'm not surprised, the handler was AWOL...
Yeah, I'm not so sure it's just the handler.
I mean, he's got paper, just not a lot of evidence.
there's no video, there's no audio.
his hand-written notes are sketchy at best.
there's nothing here that would stand up in court.
and there's this woman, Abi Rand.
Jakes has been using her as a CI. Former heroin addict.
her information hasn't led to a single arrest, and yet he keeps paying her.
thousands of dollars for nothing.
look, this all could have an explanation, but if Jakes is lying to us, if he's out of control...
so he's sleeping with his C. I. - Probably, yeah.
I'm going to bring her in, talk to her.
have you looked at the case work? - It's a mess.
it could be the handler. - You're going to blame the handler on this one?
I know Jakes, he would never jeopardize a case like this.
Rebecca, you knew him fifteen years ago.
if you ask me, I think you should shut down this whole thing right now.
maybe he's been in too long...
he believed in me, John.
he was the first.
he used to say, "I'd follow you anywhere.
I'd walk off a cliff for you."
I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt on this.
what's the C. I.'s name? - Abi.
alright, when she comes in, Maria should talk to her, not you.
we need to know we can trust Jakes.
until then, I'll look after things myself, all right?
I'll cover Jesse at the set-up house. Soon as Daniel checks out Raman, we move.
put Jakes' play in action, Gambler Dan.
you want to head over, take a look inside?
not yet. We're gonna sit tight. See who comes and goes.
so what happens if he won't pay? Rough him up a little?
we're just doing research, that's all.
alright, they're in place. Let's give it a few minutes.
I'm ready. Just say the word.
I'm just trying to figure this whole thing out.
so, the boss is Raman. And Gazi, he got shot, he's dead.
but then, Duffy, he's the one who gives you the orders, right?
you ask a lot of questions.
whatever, we don't have to talk.
okay, Daniel. Any time.
here he is.
sweet car.
that's a hundred grand easy, right there.
Yeah, that's him, that's our guy. No question - Are you kidding me? - What?
hang on a sec.
what's wrong? - I don't believe it.
that guy arrested me. - What?
like seven, eight years ago. That guy's a cop!
what? You're sure?
my first bust, man. I'll never forget his face.
Daniel, you just got made. - You're kidding me.
you're busted. Stay in the house, stay out of sight.
man, what are the friggin' odds?
so what are we gonna do?
what do you think we're gonna do? We're going to tell the boss.
son of a...
Ah, come on...
what are you doing?
you want to tell me where I am?
ABI, I'm Detective Constable Cortez.
am I under arrest?
are you a confidential informant for Marcus Jakes?
is this your C. I. number?
was I supposed to memorize it?
what about this, is that your signature?
Where's Marcus?
these are all payments made to you, in exchange for information. False information by the looks of it.
but he kept paying you.
are you sleeping with him, Abi?
he's not paying me for sex.
is Marcus Jakes your boyfriend? - So what if he is?
I get it, Abi. You probably thought you'd never get in trouble for this.
I mean he's a cop, right?
here's the thing, though, it's bogus information.
it won't hold up in court. You both knew it.
that's an offence.
I should arrest you, right now.
I want to talk to Marcus. - That's not happening.
I can't go to jail, okay? I can't. I can't do that.
I need to show you something. Do you know who this man is?
can you tell me his name.
that's Chip.
that's my ex. - Do you know who did this to him?
he was stalking me, he wouldn't leave me alone.
Abi. He almost died.
who did this? Who was it?
it was Marcus. Marcus did it.
chip came by my apartment and Marcus just lost it.
I thought he was gonna kill him.
what are you doing man, what are you doing here?
Hey, can I come in? - Yeah, come on in.
uh... Give me a minute.
alright. - Yeah.
nice digs. - Yeah, it does the job, right?
this place wired?
bedroom's on the fritz, but you know...
Yeah.
here you go. - Thank you.
so you had a late night last night?
what are we doing here, what's going on?
Rebecca's worried about the case.
she wants you to come in.
what else is new? She loves to worry, that girl.
that what you came by, to tell me? Could've just called.
your phone's off. - I would've got the message.
so how's Danny-boy? How's our play shaking out?
got made.
he, what? - Yup.
what did he do? - The muscle guy, Gavin.
turns out Daniel arrested him back in the day.
you're kidding me. - Nope.
that's just bad luck, that's what that is.
seems to happen a lot on this case.
let me ask you something.
if I were to go through this whole place, what kind of contraband would I find?
what are you talking about?
Jakes, I've been here. I've done all this.
okay? I know the temptations.
I must be good if I'm fooling you.
you're falling for the look, man. The props.
I'm squeaky clean. You know what, John?
I would have thought you of all people would know what I'm doing here.
I had to forget everything, but who I was.
just to be this guy.
I watch guys get beaten every day and I just gotta stand there.
you think that's fun for me?
I'm doing police work, are you going to help me or what?
we talked to Abi. We brought her in.
she told us the full extent.
she's prepared to testify.
the full extent of what? - You've been collecting debts.
you've been there when guys have gotten beaten.
and you haven't just been watching, you've been doing it yourself.
no no no, that's the cover, it's not real, she doesn't understand - Guys... - You've funneling cash to your C. I.
you've been making money and not reporting it.
that's not true. - You know me, you know what I'm like.
if it's true, I'm gonna find out.
I've been working this case for eight months.
I dream of this, why would I put that in jeopardy?
you like the lifestyle you like playing the part.
you don't want to leave it.
is that what you think, Rebecca?
is that what this guy's telling you?
I swear to God, Marcus, I don't know what to think.
okay, this guy John-boy, I've heard a lot of stories.
you don't think he bent the rules sometimes?
okay look, this guy was abusive.
he wouldn't leave her alone, I was worried for her.
the case is good.
so what they know Daniel's a cop? That's workable.
we could use that, he's not the first cop to owe a debt.
they'll never guess that's our cover. Rebecca, look at me.
come on, you know me, you know I wouldn't do this.
I know who you were.
I need it.
I need this Raman guy, he is a scumbag.
and he ruins people's lives.
I need something good to come out of all this.
don't. Don't turn me into the guy...
the cop who goes off the rails, and blows the big case.
don't do it to me.
can you give us a minute?
Yeah, yeah.
this guy Raman, he's vicious, he beats people up for a living.
he killed someone right in front of us.
we need to get him, Rebecca.
look, Jakes is on the edge, he has to be, it's what got him close to Raman.
I think Jakes can do it.
Really? After all this?
you're going to put your life in his hands?
you know as well as I do, that could be me outside that door right now.
you believed in this guy. Let's give him a chance to redeem himself.
let's take Raman down.
so the good news is, Gavin doesn't remember your name, just your face.
say hello to Daniel Winacott.
you're part of Guns and Gangs, just like the real Daniel.
and after a couple years, you blew it. Infractions, bad performance reports, caught in a few gambling dens and then down-graded to a desk job.
so, I'm a file-clerk. - With a temper.
and a gambling problem, you just can't resist a big fight.
listen, you think this is going to work?
raman deals with cops all the time, probably some of his best clients.
OK, It's fight night at Raman's club.
Daniel, you're there to bet on the fight, and Maria, you're his new girlfriend.
Jakes and John, you're gonna make contact with Raman, and deliver Gambler Dan right to him.
all Raman has to do is try and collect and we got him, we'll take him down.
yo, focus man, I need you here.
how's our boy doing? - To be honest, a bit shaky.
but he's obsessed with Raman. He'll get through it.
that Rebecca? She worried about me? - She's fine.
is that the best you can do? - Come on, tell me.
Jakes, we're wired. - I don't care about the wire.
give it to me straight, brother John. Is this my last day on the job?
this is our last chance at this case.
I mean as a cop. She's gonna take my badge, isn't she?
that's up to you. Look, we'll talk about that tomorrow.
tonight, let's just focus on getting the bad guys, all right?
Rebecca wouldn't put you in play if she didn't think you could do this.
you don't know Becks like I do.
once you lose her trust, it's over. Right, Rebecca?
well you're going to have to earn it back. Jakes, you are good at this job.
you just got to remind her that, alright?
okay? Okay?
Yeah, yeah, okay.
heads up. Here comes the target.
imagine my surprise when I discovered that the man you asked me to collect from is a cop.
he is, I should have mentioned that to you. I didn't want you to say no.
did you know about this, Marcus? Did you know?
it's my fault I didn't even tell him.
look, this cop a screw-up. He has no friends.
there will be no payback. You have my guarantee.
he's over there at the bar right now.
he's with his new girlfriend.
you brought him here.
I brought him to the fight as a peace offering.
trust me, he has absolutely no idea you're about to collect on his debt.
look, you're going to make a lot of money tonight, my friend.
and you're going to have me to thank for that.
let's do it right now, I'll call him over.
no, leave him there for a minute, he's fine.
he's enjoying himself. My problem is this.
I don't like police.
and to be perfectly honest, I'm starting to have an uneasy feeling about you, Jakes.
what are you talking about? - And I always listen to that feeling.
what's he doing?
stop, why are you killing this?
this is not happening. I'm sorry, Jakes.
not tonight. Enjoy the fight.
you and your friend.
that's it? He can't just walk away. - He can and he just did.
Rebecca, I think we're done here.
you want to give him some time, circle back?
no, there's no point. It's over. He just closed the door.
come on, are you kidding me? You're just giving up?
calm down Jakes, we're done.
so what? We're just shutting down?
let's pack it up.
here we go, boys.
no head butts, eye gouging, groin attacks, or head kicking to a grounded opponent.
alright, so that's it I guess. - Next time, right?
I'll see you back at the shop.
okay, but I'm staying for the fight.
what do you wanna do, wanna watch the fight?
it's not over.
you think you can just walk away? You think we're done?
come here!
where do you go? Where do you go?
what are you doing?
he's unarmed. He's going to tell us everything.
every crime, every detail.
or I'm going to put a bullet in him.
Hey, where's John? Have you seen him?
no, and no Jakes.
you think this is gonna work? - He's gonna confess.
he's gonna say we beat it out of him.
and then we're gonna deny it.
what do you mean "we"?
I, mean you and me. You're gonna get my back.
you want me to lie for you? - Yes.
eight months, John, I've been after this guy for eight months.
I'm not just gonna let him go. If you're not up for it, you leave.
wake up!
wake up!
alright, Jakes. Come on, don't do this.
I'm gonna back you up on this one, okay?
we'll say he came after you, it was self-defense.
you will not be charged.
but after that, Jakes, you've got to walk away from this one right now.
right now, you need to walk away.
wake up!
Maria, what's going on in there?
Jakes and John, where are they? - We left them watching the fight.
what about Raman? - He's not here either.
find them.
we gotta split up.
I've been where you are. All right?
thanks to this job... I've racked up a divorce,
I got a bleak apartment I can barely unpack,
I lie awake in my bed at night full of anger, full of this constant rage.
good for you.
Awww, there he is!
wait, Jakes, I get it, all right? Oh no, you don't get it.
this guy tortures people, and takes pleasure from doing it!
and he's gonna say it, into the phone or I'm gonna put a bullet in his brain.
talk, tell it! Tell me how you torture people!
you're right. This guy is scum.
talk! - He's an animal, he deserves it.
okay, you could kill him right now, no one would shed a tear.
let me tell you something...
if you do that, if you shoot him, you will be lost, my friend.
you are done.
you will never come back from that, ever again.
you understand me?
right now you are standing on the edge.
you need to step back now. Just one step back.
come on, I'm right here.
I'm not forcing you.
come on.
you gotta step back.
you're gonna charge him? - I'm gonna try.
Jakes. - You need to arrest me.
you need to take me in. - I'm sorry.
let's go.
this is gonna sound strange.
I'm glad it was you.
Daniel. Want to come and help me unpack?
there's a couple beer in it for you.
tempting, but I got a thing tonight. - Well, that's your loss, pal.
tell you what, save me a cold one.
nice place. You need to start locking your door, though.
everything's unpacked.
you did this all for me?
someone needed to take responsibility.
I'm gonna get you all keys, alright?
guys...
okay, tough guy. What would you do if I did this...
not bad.
it's the reflexes of a jungle cat.
is that right?
yeah... - Yeah?
I can still see that skinny kid in his uniform.
never really fit him. Didn't fit any of us.
all he wanted was to catch the bad guy.
I should've seen it.
you did. I pushed.
I let you.
you ever worry it'll happen to you?
every day.
it's nine o'clock, you promised you'd be home.
I know I'm still downtown, I'm sorry.
can we talk about this when I get home...
please, please... - Are you OK?
help! - John!
go, get in!
let's go, let's go!
you know, it's a lot easier to sneak out on a full stomach.
good morning.
you don't have to disappear every time we hook up.
a little breakfast never hurt anyone.
unless you're a chicken.
it's just that, I have an early morning.
I got a meeting in a few minutes.
listen, if I stay for breakfast, then I'll be here for dinner, and maybe, we'll catch a movie, a ball game.
a month or so and it'll be dinner with your parents... - They live in Arizona.
okay, fine, then it'll be your boss or a friend.
but, here's the thing, I just won't be there.
I won't make it. - Maria.
and you'll pretend that it's fine but you won't trust me, you'll be jealous.
Hey, hey, come on.
you're about to break us up and we haven't even had our first date yet.
that's the best part.
I mean, I don't even know what you do for a living.
I like this.
Ethan, this isn't broken. Why do you want to fix it?
because whatever it is you're scared of, it's not me.
this, whatever this is, it's real.
I'm sorry.
we've been on this case two weeks and there've been five more carjackings.
the latest victim. Jon Davis.
father of two, beaten unconscious and relieved of his late model Audi.
we know these attacks are related. They go back almost a year.
multiple armed crews all over the city. Millions of dollars in car thefts.
what we don't know is who's calling the shots.
whoever's running the crews and moving the cars, they're serious, they're pros, alright?
innocent targets, brutal violence.
we need to shut these guys down, fast.
you've made some progress? - OK, so I've been making friends with these two.
Ryan and Alex. I met them at a street race.
you were driving? - Are you kidding me?
Maria's the best driver in this whole division.
Seriously?
Yeah, my dad's idea of quality time was me holding a torque wrench while he swapped out a gasket.
so these guys, are they partners? One of the two-men crews?
they fit the profile to a T.
Yep. Alex has a thug. He's got a rap sheet a mile long.
plenty of carjacking, brutal violence. But Ryan's different, he's my guy...
I scored points with him driving, talking shop.
he's starting to trust me and I can tell he's not into the violence.
he says he's got a job coming in later today.
coming in... What does that mean? - We don't know. He won't give her the details yet.
but he's agreed to introduce me to his boss. - That's good.
alright. Let's get Maria prepped.
she's gonna be our primary, whatever she needs.
this might be her only chance to move up the chain, we can't miss it.
Daniel, I want you close cover.
Jesse and I will hang back and be ready to move where the play takes us.
whoever we're dealing with, has no problem breaking what gets in their way.
so it's only a matter of time until escalates and we end up with a homicide.
scooped the cold air intake from a guy in Pasadena.
custom weld and polish.
and it gets you what? 20 horses, tops?
drop nitrous in and you're talking 200.
for 20 seconds. Then you shred your engine.
probably take you a whole tank just to get this beast up a hill.
you need something new, carbon fiber, CPU-controlled hydraulics...
when I'm red lining into a hairpin, I trust my car, not a computer.
watch out.
here comes trouble. - I got him.
what are you doing here, man?
you know, I still can't figure out why a big guy like you is so afraid of girls.
ease up. She's cool.
we have a meet, Ryan.
yeah? Well, that's why she's here, I want her to meet our guy.
so what, you think you just gonna cut her in, is that what you're thinking?
is that coming out of your cake? Were you even ask me about that?
like a need your permission to make a move.
we need a driver. She's crazy good, you know that.
you need to get out of here, right now.
or what?
trust me, your boss is going to want to meet me.
OK, drop it. He's here.
I'll tell you what, she's in, I'm out, man.
that simple.
we'll talk, alright?
alright, here we go.
it's handshakes and small talk.
got it, right?
he just gave Ryan some money. - That's it, that'll be for the job.
we're gonna stay on this guy. - Alright, I'll see you back at HQ.
he says now, he means now, we do it tonight. - So what's the gig?
well, come on. You said you'd cut me in.
and I told you to disappear, little girl. - Did you?
you know, it's weird. I just zone out whenever you open your mouth.
how about I make you pay attention, bitch.
Hey, hey, back off. - Calm down before someone gets hurt.
Oh, really? You think you're gonna hurt me? Is that watcha think?
give me a reason.
Arrrgh, get her under control, man. - Yeah, well, calm down.
you said you need a driver, right? - This ain't chauffeuring, sweetheart.
let's go, you, me quarter mile, right now. - What do I get when I win?
my ride. We race for pink slips.
what the hell are you doing, Maria?
I want you to watch when I sell your car for parts.
you heard it.
what's wrong? You need a handicap, sweetheart?
I'll give you two car length, but if you don't have the balls, I mean...
get in your car. I don't need no handicap.
we checked the target's photo against the database, nothing.
did you run his plates? - Also nothing. Where are you right now?
we followed him to a business, Vaughn Motorsports.
he's still inside. - Kahli?
it's a private dealership, exclusive high end car sales.
owned by Ellen and Davin Vaughn.
looks completely legit.
I guess we're gonna have to go inside then. Take a look.
your son needs a new car. Stuff like that?
maybe I'm into some kind of sketchy business, see if they bite.
read my mind.
Hey, if you can get me photos of VIN numbers on the cars,
I can run them, see if they're stolen.
we just need one for a search warrant. - Alright, done.
we should probably get changed. - Let's go get rich.
quarter mile to the concrete road block.
first one there wins.
keep your car.
all I want is to get in on your action.
fine.
pick us up tonight. We'll text you.
normally we're by appointment only.
these cars are sick.
he has an exuberance for this sort of thing.
this is very last minute, I forgot my son's birthday.
so I'm in the doghouse here.
are you interested in anything in particular? - A happy son.
I promised him anything he wanted.
I don't know, he said 'chick-magnet'.
I guessing that's a sports car.
well, Mr... Ross, John Ross.
we can get whatever your son wants.
as long as you're serious. - Oh, I'm very serious.
I assume paying cash won't be a problem?
what line of work are you in, Mr. Ross?
let's call it import and export.
cash will be just fine.
good.
the husband and wife are clean.
I ran every VIN number you got and...
not one of the cars is stolen. - You think they have a chop shop?
no, cause the numbers are stamped all over the parts, right?
so one of them would have flagged by now.
they must be involved. Why else would this guy be there?
what are you doing?
I'm working.
isn't that what we're doing here?
I don't know, is it?
Jesse, Daniel's waiting out front. We're going to back up Maria.
get moving. - I'm on my way.
what are we doing here?
I thought we were breaking into a car, not a house.
you ever boosted a Lamborghini? - No. Why?
engine lock, GPS tracking.
it's cleaner and faster if we snag the keys.
especially when nobody's home.
you sure about that? - Yeah, I'm sure. Relax.
gotcha!
let's do this.
here we go, they're in. We've got no eyes.
second floor. Is that them?
what's happening?
a light just went on upstairs, I'm texting Maria.
someone home.
guys.
I heard someone upstairs. Someone's home. We gotta go.
maybe we should bail? - No, no, we don't leave without the car.
is someone there? What the hell are you doing?
Hey, no!
get in there! Go!
you should have stayed upstairs, old man.
enough! Stop.
I said stop!
back off! He saw your face.
we have to deal with him.
we're not here to make a mess. We're here for the car.
police! Show me your hands!
get on the ground. On the ground! Get down!
show me your hands! - Get down!
sir, you alright? You're going to be alright, sir.
I need an ambulance at 20 Peldar Street.
I have a civilian male, severe head trauma.
this isn't my first time either, so you can skip the tough guy stuff.
we're both professionals, right? - Professionals?
career cop, career criminal.
it is what it is.
whatever you say.
I need an introduction to your boss.
for what? Maybe a couple years off my sentence? Maybe some early parole?
I can talk to the prosecutor. - Yeah? That sounds good.
except, I ain't no rat.
I can stand my time, bitch. So screw you.
well, I have to say that's a relief.
Phil Bronte, the man at the house.
you put a grandfather in the hospital, Alex.
you're out of control, and you're a coward.
I was worried you might cut a deal.
you trying to play me?
no games.
truth is I want you to go to jail for a long, long time.
and this non-compliance you're showing, that means I can push for maximum sentence.
it's a good day.
maximum sentence, are you serious in there?
it was no play.
major crime can charge him. Make sure they take their time.
OK. - So what now? We stick with Ryan?
make him an agent, see if he'll work with us, maybe?
we're going to need Ryan's help, he can get us to Zeke. Think he can handle it?
I don't know.
you don't think he'll flip? - In a heart beat.
this just got real for him. He needs an out.
but working with us is a lot of pressure. I'm not sure I can trust him.
OK, so why don't you go in there, talk to him, see how it feels.
okay. I'll give it a shot.
he's in rough shape.
can you give us the room? - Yeah.
all right.
Hey, Ryan.
you're a cop? Are you kidding me?
you're good, I had no idea.
you know what's stupid? I'm still happy to see you.
it's always good to see a friend. - You're a cop.
best friend to have right now.
so what...?
are you going to, like, question me?
make a report? Take me to jail?
do I have a choice?
everybody makes mistakes, you're mine.
my mom always said that to me.
that's a hell of a thing to say to her kid.
Yeah, but what I'm doing, stealing cars and all that...?
she hates it.
I don't blame her.
look at me. I'm sitting here worrying what my mom's gonna think.
last night, you tried to stop Alex.
he was beating that man... - So?
so you know what I think?
I think you're better than that.
than him.
I can help you.
I can drop these charges but you have to help me first.
what kind of help are we talking? - I need a way in.
we'll start with the guy from yesterday, your boss?
work our way up...
Hey, if you aren't up for this, you need to let me know.
I need to be able to trust you.
completely.
can I trust you?
let's start with the name of your boss.
the guy in the Hummer who gave you the job.
why don't you tell me who you work for? - His name is Zeke Weston.
he's crazy violent.
especially if you make a mistake.
runs, like, ten crews of guys who jack cars.
he gives us a name, an address, we deliver the cars, and Zeke makes them squeaky clean and legal.
what happens to them then? How do they get sold?
do the clients know they're stolen? - I swear, I have no idea.
I'm just the help, right? And Zeke isn't much of a talker.
can you bring me in as your new partner? You think he'd go for that?
Yeah.
I mean, I can try.
OK, so we're going right into Zeke's garage, with you getting busted last night, he's gonna be tense as hell.
so you got to keep him calm, he needs to feel like he's in control, alright?
now my guys will be outside, they'll be listening.
so if we get into any kind of trouble, they'll be right there to back us up.
okay, you ready?
take a deep breath. And remember, "I'm not a cop."
come on.
what the hell is she doing here?
I asked you a question. What is she doing here?
come on, Ryan. Step up. You got this.
that job you gave us last night.
that was junk, Zeke. The guy was home, alright? Alex is done.
Yeah, Alex called me. From jail. He said you got busted.
that's right, I had to bail myself out, man.
Alex beat the hell out of the guy which is why he's still in.
anyway, the point is, now I need a new partner.
alright? That's what she's doing here.
I just wanted to clear it with you, out of respect.
Ryan gets very confused sometimes.
he says things he shouldn't.
Where'd you meet her? - It's Maria.
racing pink slips out at Cherry Beach. - She can drive?
gave him a spot, six car lengths. Still smoked him.
who does she work for?
you. Starting now.
come on. Come on...
we're done here. I do the recruiting.
take a walk.
no sale.
it's alright.
could be a first step, we'll stay on Zeke.
see what he gets into.
I have to say I'm impressed. Only five hundred production models built, and last time I checked there weren't any left.
where did you find it? - I have a number of suppliers.
you mind if I take a photograph?
for my son.
these days if it doesn't happen in a photograph, it never happened. Of course.
OK, got the photo. - Do you think your son will like it?
I hope so. It's his favorite color.
nothing. It's clean.
I have friends overseas who'd be interested in this sort of thing.
is that right? - Of course, it would have to be volume.
but if you could move cars like this, 20 grand a unit?
20 thousands each? At that price they would have to be stolen.
you have the capacity for this sort of operation?
I ship things overseas, in containers.
heavy machinery, textiles, that sort of thing.
including cars.
certainly possible, why not?
you're talking to the wrong people, Mr. Ross.
that's too bad. - I'm sorry we can't help you.
well, if you change your mind.
I'm going to show this to my son.
I'll be in touch.
give our best to your boy.
once again, VIN was clean. - Nah, they've gotta be fake.
Khali ran the numbers. Paperwork's legit.
I ask for a car that's impossible to buy, and they come up with one literally overnight.
we have no way to prove that it's stolen. - Yeah, but the wife, Ellen, she was into the deal.
she was already spending the money in her head. - It was the husband that backed away?
there was something going on there, plenty of tension.
these people are careful, we've seen that with Zeke.
they're smart, so we just have to be smarter.
yeah? - It's Daniel.
Hey. - We've got action with Zeke.
we followed him to a park. He's out of his car. - What's he doing?
looks like he's meeting up with the wife, Ellen Vaughn.
just her? No husband? - Yeah, looks that way.
who, are you seeing this? - Yeah... Yeah, keep shooting.
what is it? - Ellen and Zeke.
I think we just found a way in.
so she's married to the money, but she's sleeping with the muscle.
Yeah, this is more than a one night stand.
you're sure? - Yeah, look at his hand.
on her back, there's a closeness between them, not an urgency.
she's looking into his eyes. There's trust there.
this is real for her. - So how do we use it?
I'll reach out to Ellen.
if she's looking for an exit ramp for her and her boyfriend, I'll be happy to provide.
meanwhile, Ryan delivers the photos to the husband.
he wants to prove his loyalty, and thought Davin should know what his wife is doing.
he uses it as a chance to step up. - That's a lot of pressure on Ryan.
he can handle it.
set up a meeting with Ellen, see if she bites.
all right.
Hey. Nice job with this kid. - Ryan?
anyone could've flipped him. - That's not true.
you made a genuine connection. He trusts you, Maria, he believes in you.
he looks at me, all he sees is a get out of jail free card.
don't be so sure.
we're just waiting on a signal. You remember what to say?
I'm your new partner, right? - Yeah. I'm good.
I'm gonna keep my distance, you got this.
I jacked my first car before I could drive.
me and a buddy, we swiped this minivan, drove it around the block.
I bet it was a rush.
it sounds stupid but I always thought I wouldn't be able to do it.
like it wouldn't be that easy or something.
then I started learning security systems, ignition overrides.
I could boost anything with an engine.
we used to swipe cars from the airport lot.
no one got hurt. It's like it wasn't even real.
but these guys... Everyone gets hurt.
we'll shut them down.
I always thought cops were kind of lame.
but all this?
way bigger rush than joyriding that minivan.
I guess you're probably used to it. - It never gets old.
it's gotta be tough, though.
always pretending to be someone you're not.
you ever just miss just being yourself?
Yeah. - You're good to go.
okay. Headed in.
you ready?
yeah...
it's a nice day for a walk. I'm glad you called.
I wanted to apologize for my husband.
you don't have to apologize, I understand.
he's the overbearing, controlling type.
is that what you think? - I'll tell you what's clear to me.
your partnership isn't working and if I were you, I'd ditch him. I can move your cars, Ellen.
this was a mistake.
Ellen, you're the smartest person in the room and he won't even trust your judgment.
I didn't come here for an appraisal of my marriage.
you'll have complete autonomy, you'll obtain the product,
I'll move it overseas, where I will sell it.
what kind of business do you think I'm running, exactly?
listen, do you think I just happened to come out of nowhere?
I've had my eyes on your operation for some time now.
I can help you take it to another level if you want me to.
it's up to you.
Mr. Vaughn. - Ryan, isn't it?
Zeke's not here.
actually, sir, I wanted to talk to you.
the reason I wanted to see you...
Ryan, whatever it is, you can take it up with Zeke.
you need to leave now.
this is too much for him. - Give him a second.
photos just went down.
no one knows. I swear.
why bring this to me? - Zeke is out of control, he's dangerous.
this operation should be clean, low profile.
but Zeke's got crews putting people in hospitals.
me and my partner back there, we'll do things differently.
so you want his job. You're an opportunist.
if I was, I'd be blackmailing your wife.
he's doing good.
look, I get it. I'm nobody to you, I'm nothing.
but right now, I'm the one person who isn't lying to you.
wait.
come back tonight, we'll talk.
I thought for sure he wasn't gonna go for it.
you did great in there. - So what's our next move?
we just blew up their entire foundation.
now, we show Davin that we can help put it back together.
looks like Ryan made quite the impression.
the dealership was shut up tight. No sign of Davin or the lovers.
I'm sure Davin is freaking out right now. He said he'd be in touch.
Hey, look at this, I got something.
I set up a fake website for John's import-export firm.
Ellen Vaughn just paid it a visit. - You sure it's Ellen?
Yeah, I tracked the IP address, it's her, she's checking him out.
that means she's interested. - She's making a move.
her and Zeke, that's good. They're scrambling.
if we could set up a buy we could shut this whole thing down.
Oh no, it's Ryan. Something's wrong, he's panicking.
I gotta go.
I got your text, what's wrong? - We messed up.
Zeke called me. He sounds really weird.
Davin must have told him that I ratted him out.
OK, slow down. Tell me what happened.
Zeke wants me to pick up a car from the drop spot, get it taken care of.
what does that mean? - I did this once for him.
if we get a car that's too hot, Zeke leaves it in the drop spot for me.
I have to pick it up, take it to the crushers.
so if you get busted with the car, it's on you, and Zeke just walks away.
it's usually no big deal. But this time, something's different.
I could hear it in his voice. He was ice-cold.
you think he's setting you up?
the drop spot is isolated, there's no cameras.
if I go there, anything could happen. - But we don't have a choice.
Zeke will get suspicious if we don't do what he says, right?
we?
you're not alone in this. Where's the pickup spot?
it's back that way. - Let's go.
here come my guys. We're gonna check out the car, make sure it's safe.
Hey, stay back.
we circled the perimeter twice, it's clear. We're alone.
alright, which one?
right there, red sedan. Keys are under the bumper.
it doesn't look right to me.
the back wheels are low. There's something heavy in the trunk.
Rebecca, we got eyes on the car, could be rigged with explosives.
get everyone out of there, I'm calling the bomb squad.
Oh, no, wait a second, we know Zeke is reckless and impulsive.
but... a bomb? It doesn't make sense.
especially if it's personal.
if anything, he's going to want to cave Ryan's head in with a tire iron himself.
I'm going to take a closer look.
John, are you listening to me? Keep your distance.
Rebecca, I'm losing you, you're starting to break up.
roll ETF to their location now. Bomb disposal unit.
what are you doing? - I'm gonna go take a look.
I'm right with you. - No, no, no. Both of you stay put.
only need one of us to be stupid.
homicide's working on search warrants. - Too slow.
in the meantime, our happy couple disappears.
we're running out of time, we need to get a confession.
the good news is Ellen Vaughn has reached out.
she wants a meeting with John Ross, the exporter.
so we do a double play.
while I'm working on the wife, Maria could be working on the boyfriend, Zeke.
we gotta get a matching car, same make, model as the one we found the body in.
Why? - So that Ryan can drive it back.
he got nervous, he looked in the trunk, found the body.
now he's gonna confront Zeke, all freaked out. - Seeing that car, the shock of it...
they might just fall apart. - Yeah, that's a good plan.
but does it get us a confession? - At this point, it's our best shot.
okay, we're in position.
good. Maria? - Good to go.
stand by, we're waiting on John's signal. - Okay, standing by.
any minute now.
listen, we don't know how Zeke's gonna react when he sees this car.
I do.
I got this, I know how to talk to him.
if things go South, you follow my lead.
Yeah.
when this is all over with, you ever thought about what you might do?
I've never been good at anything besides stealing cars.
you're pretty good at this. - I'm no cop.
no. But we could put you on the payroll, and you could help us out.
as a job? - Yeah, you're pretty good at this.
might be worth it, just to see the look on my mom's face.
we want to move the cars, right now, fast.
they're all ready to go, the detailed list is in my office.
I don't need a list. What I need is the history of each vehicle.
in case any issues should arise.
they're untraceable. I do the work myself.
that's not much of an assurance. My clients need more than that.
we take the VIN numbers from wrecked cars, we copy them, and we put them on ours.
but then there's no paper trail. - We make one.
you can look as deep as you want, all you find is a clean car.
we can discuss money in my office.
of course. But first I want to pick up that present for my son.
there's the cue. - Maria, you're on.
we've got them on the cars, now let's get them for murder.
OK, going in.
is everything okay?
fine. Let's step into my office.
get that out of here. - The car, or the body in the trunk?
will your husband be joining us? - No I'll be handling this.
all I need to know is if he's gonna be a problem.
can we get him on the phone? - I can't, he's unavailable.
what was the plan? I get caught dumping the car, go down for murder?
was that it? Did you really think you could get away with it?
you don't know what you're talking about.
Yeah...? So tell me.
you need to shut up, right now. Move. Outside.
come on, Ryan, let's go outside.
so you gonna kill me like you killed Davin, huh? You coward?
Ryan, that's enough. - Daniel, Jesse, start moving in.
let's go.
come on, Ryan, let's go. You shouldn't have come here.
tell me what happened, or else I'm going to the cops.
Ryan, stop! - I told you to shut up!
Ryan! No...
John, he's got a knife, get over here!
police get on the ground, don't move!
there's so much blood.
I need an ambulance at 151 Dumay, we have a civilian injured.
severe abdominal stab. - Shut up!
Ryan, listen to me, listen.
you have to stay still, okay. Ambulance is on it's way.
it happened so fast. - I know, look at me, look at me.
I want you to picture your mom's face when you tell her you work for the cops.
she'd never believe me.
you're gonna be OK, you're gonna get out of this, OK?
the ambulance is on it's way. Ryan!
Ryan, Ryan, you're gonna be okay.
I don't even know your real name.
it's Maria. Maria Cortez.
that's a really pretty name.
it's okay, you're going to be okay.
Ryan, stay still, please. Please.
please!
Mrs. Everwood?
my name is Maria, I'm a police officer.
I need to talk to you about your son, Ryan.
you people.
no, I don't know where he's living, and no, I haven't talked to him in a couple of years.
uh, Mrs. Everwood. Ryan isn't in trouble.
he was working on a case, helping police.
helping me.
helping me.
Ryan's been injured, he was stabbed.
how bad is it? - He lost a lot blood, he's gonna need surgery, but he is conscious, and...
the doctors think he's gonna be okay.
I knew this was gonna happen, I've been waiting for it.
your son stopped a lot of people from getting hurt.
he wants to make a change.
he's been asking for you.
I can take you if you'd like. - Yes, thank you.
what? Maria's blaming herself.
that kid almost died.
she'll be fine. I'll check in with her.
this job.
you spend all this time with someone and then...
you arrest them, or...
they get stabbed...
but you made a connection. You opened up to them.
you know what the tough part is?
going home at night to someone who loves you, and you have to open up to them, all over again.
I'm sorry I didn't call first. - No, it's okay.
I'm a cop.
you wanted to know what I do for a living.
okay.
and you were wrong.
I am scared of you.
you're the first guy I've connected with, in a long time.
and that kind of freaks me out.
why don't you come inside?
let's go out. Talk.
it's three in the morning.
that's okay. You'll get used to it.
it's nine o'clock, you promised you'd be home.
I know I'm still downtown, I'm sorry.
can we talk about this when I get home...
please, please... - Are you OK?
help! - John!
go, get in!
let's go, let's go!
you know, it's a lot easier to sneak out on a full stomach.
good morning.
you don't have to disappear every time we hook up.
a little breakfast never hurt anyone.
unless you're a chicken.
it's just that, I have an early morning.
I got a meeting in a few minutes.
listen, if I stay for breakfast, then I'll be here for dinner, and maybe, we'll catch a movie, a ball game.
a month or so and it'll be dinner with your parents... - They live in Arizona.
okay, fine, then it'll be your boss or a friend.
but, here's the thing, I just won't be there.
I won't make it. - Maria.
and you'll pretend that it's fine but you won't trust me, you'll be jealous.
Hey, hey, come on.
you're about to break us up and we haven't even had our first date yet.
that's the best part.
I mean, I don't even know what you do for a living.
I like this.
Ethan, this isn't broken. Why do you want to fix it?
because whatever it is you're scared of, it's not me.
this, whatever this is, it's real.
I'm sorry.
we've been on this case two weeks and there've been five more carjackings.
the latest victim. Jon Davis.
father of two, beaten unconscious and relieved of his late model Audi.
we know these attacks are related. They go back almost a year.
multiple armed crews all over the city. Millions of dollars in car thefts.
what we don't know is who's calling the shots.
whoever's running the crews and moving the cars, they're serious, they're pros, alright?
innocent targets, brutal violence.
we need to shut these guys down, fast.
you've made some progress? - OK, so I've been making friends with these two.
Ryan and Alex. I met them at a street race.
you were driving? - Are you kidding me?
Maria's the best driver in this whole division.
Seriously?
Yeah, my dad's idea of quality time was me holding a torque wrench while he swapped out a gasket.
so these guys, are they partners? One of the two-men crews?
they fit the profile to a T.
Yep. Alex has a thug. He's got a rap sheet a mile long.
plenty of carjacking, brutal violence. But Ryan's different, he's my guy...
I scored points with him driving, talking shop.
he's starting to trust me and I can tell he's not into the violence.
he says he's got a job coming in later today.
coming in... What does that mean? - We don't know. He won't give her the details yet.
but he's agreed to introduce me to his boss. - That's good.
alright. Let's get Maria prepped.
she's gonna be our primary, whatever she needs.
this might be her only chance to move up the chain, we can't miss it.
Daniel, I want you close cover.
Jesse and I will hang back and be ready to move where the play takes us.
whoever we're dealing with, has no problem breaking what gets in their way.
so it's only a matter of time until escalates and we end up with a homicide.
scooped the cold air intake from a guy in Pasadena.
custom weld and polish.
and it gets you what? 20 horses, tops?
drop nitrous in and you're talking 200.
for 20 seconds. Then you shred your engine.
probably take you a whole tank just to get this beast up a hill.
you need something new, carbon fiber, CPU-controlled hydraulics...
when I'm red lining into a hairpin, I trust my car, not a computer.
watch out.
here comes trouble. - I got him.
what are you doing here, man?
you know, I still can't figure out why a big guy like you is so afraid of girls.
ease up. She's cool.
we have a meet, Ryan.
yeah? Well, that's why she's here, I want her to meet our guy.
so what, you think you just gonna cut her in, is that what you're thinking?
is that coming out of your cake? Were you even ask me about that?
like a need your permission to make a move.
we need a driver. She's crazy good, you know that.
you need to get out of here, right now.
or what?
trust me, your boss is going to want to meet me.
OK, drop it. He's here.
I'll tell you what, she's in, I'm out, man.
that simple.
we'll talk, alright?
alright, here we go.
it's handshakes and small talk.
got it, right?
he just gave Ryan some money. - That's it, that'll be for the job.
we're gonna stay on this guy. - Alright, I'll see you back at HQ.
he says now, he means now, we do it tonight. - So what's the gig?
well, come on. You said you'd cut me in.
and I told you to disappear, little girl. - Did you?
you know, it's weird. I just zone out whenever you open your mouth.
how about I make you pay attention, bitch.
Hey, hey, back off. - Calm down before someone gets hurt.
Oh, really? You think you're gonna hurt me? Is that watcha think?
give me a reason.
Arrrgh, get her under control, man. - Yeah, well, calm down.
you said you need a driver, right? - This ain't chauffeuring, sweetheart.
let's go, you, me quarter mile, right now. - What do I get when I win?
my ride. We race for pink slips.
what the hell are you doing, Maria?
I want you to watch when I sell your car for parts.
you heard it.
what's wrong? You need a handicap, sweetheart?
I'll give you two car length, but if you don't have the balls, I mean...
get in your car. I don't need no handicap.
we checked the target's photo against the database, nothing.
did you run his plates? - Also nothing. Where are you right now?
we followed him to a business, Vaughn Motorsports.
he's still inside. - Kahli?
it's a private dealership, exclusive high end car sales.
owned by Ellen and Davin Vaughn.
looks completely legit.
I guess we're gonna have to go inside then. Take a look.
your son needs a new car. Stuff like that?
maybe I'm into some kind of sketchy business, see if they bite.
read my mind.
Hey, if you can get me photos of VIN numbers on the cars,
I can run them, see if they're stolen.
we just need one for a search warrant. - Alright, done.
we should probably get changed. - Let's go get rich.
quarter mile to the concrete road block.
first one there wins.
keep your car.
all I want is to get in on your action.
fine.
pick us up tonight. We'll text you.
normally we're by appointment only.
these cars are sick.
he has an exuberance for this sort of thing.
this is very last minute, I forgot my son's birthday.
so I'm in the doghouse here.
are you interested in anything in particular? - A happy son.
I promised him anything he wanted.
I don't know, he said 'chick-magnet'.
I guessing that's a sports car.
well, Mr... Ross, John Ross.
we can get whatever your son wants.
as long as you're serious. - Oh, I'm very serious.
I assume paying cash won't be a problem?
what line of work are you in, Mr. Ross?
let's call it import and export.
cash will be just fine.
good.
the husband and wife are clean.
I ran every VIN number you got and...
not one of the cars is stolen. - You think they have a chop shop?
no, cause the numbers are stamped all over the parts, right?
so one of them would have flagged by now.
they must be involved. Why else would this guy be there?
what are you doing?
I'm working.
isn't that what we're doing here?
I don't know, is it?
Jesse, Daniel's waiting out front. We're going to back up Maria.
get moving. - I'm on my way.
what are we doing here?
I thought we were breaking into a car, not a house.
you ever boosted a Lamborghini? - No. Why?
engine lock, GPS tracking.
it's cleaner and faster if we snag the keys.
especially when nobody's home.
you sure about that? - Yeah, I'm sure. Relax.
gotcha!
let's do this.
here we go, they're in. We've got no eyes.
second floor. Is that them?
what's happening?
a light just went on upstairs, I'm texting Maria.
someone home.
guys.
I heard someone upstairs. Someone's home. We gotta go.
maybe we should bail? - No, no, we don't leave without the car.
is someone there? What the hell are you doing?
Hey, no!
get in there! Go!
you should have stayed upstairs, old man.
enough! Stop.
I said stop!
back off! He saw your face.
we have to deal with him.
we're not here to make a mess. We're here for the car.
police! Show me your hands!
get on the ground. On the ground! Get down!
show me your hands! - Get down!
sir, you alright? You're going to be alright, sir.
I need an ambulance at 20 Peldar Street.
I have a civilian male, severe head trauma.
this isn't my first time either, so you can skip the tough guy stuff.
we're both professionals, right? - Professionals?
career cop, career criminal.
it is what it is.
whatever you say.
I need an introduction to your boss.
for what? Maybe a couple years off my sentence? Maybe some early parole?
I can talk to the prosecutor. - Yeah? That sounds good.
except, I ain't no rat.
I can stand my time, bitch. So screw you.
well, I have to say that's a relief.
Phil Bronte, the man at the house.
you put a grandfather in the hospital, Alex.
you're out of control, and you're a coward.
I was worried you might cut a deal.
you trying to play me?
no games.
truth is I want you to go to jail for a long, long time.
and this non-compliance you're showing, that means I can push for maximum sentence.
it's a good day.
maximum sentence, are you serious in there?
it was no play.
major crime can charge him. Make sure they take their time.
OK. - So what now? We stick with Ryan?
make him an agent, see if he'll work with us, maybe?
we're going to need Ryan's help, he can get us to Zeke. Think he can handle it?
I don't know.
you don't think he'll flip? - In a heart beat.
this just got real for him. He needs an out.
but working with us is a lot of pressure. I'm not sure I can trust him.
OK, so why don't you go in there, talk to him, see how it feels.
okay. I'll give it a shot.
he's in rough shape.
can you give us the room? - Yeah.
all right.
Hey, Ryan.
you're a cop? Are you kidding me?
you're good, I had no idea.
you know what's stupid? I'm still happy to see you.
it's always good to see a friend. - You're a cop.
best friend to have right now.
so what...?
are you going to, like, question me?
make a report? Take me to jail?
do I have a choice?
everybody makes mistakes, you're mine.
my mom always said that to me.
that's a hell of a thing to say to her kid.
Yeah, but what I'm doing, stealing cars and all that...?
she hates it.
I don't blame her.
look at me. I'm sitting here worrying what my mom's gonna think.
last night, you tried to stop Alex.
he was beating that man... - So?
so you know what I think?
I think you're better than that.
than him.
I can help you.
I can drop these charges but you have to help me first.
what kind of help are we talking? - I need a way in.
we'll start with the guy from yesterday, your boss?
work our way up...
Hey, if you aren't up for this, you need to let me know.
I need to be able to trust you.
completely.
can I trust you?
let's start with the name of your boss.
the guy in the Hummer who gave you the job.
why don't you tell me who you work for? - His name is Zeke Weston.
he's crazy violent.
especially if you make a mistake.
runs, like, ten crews of guys who jack cars.
he gives us a name, an address, we deliver the cars, and Zeke makes them squeaky clean and legal.
what happens to them then? How do they get sold?
do the clients know they're stolen? - I swear, I have no idea.
I'm just the help, right? And Zeke isn't much of a talker.
can you bring me in as your new partner? You think he'd go for that?
Yeah.
I mean, I can try.
OK, so we're going right into Zeke's garage, with you getting busted last night, he's gonna be tense as hell.
so you got to keep him calm, he needs to feel like he's in control, alright?
now my guys will be outside, they'll be listening.
so if we get into any kind of trouble, they'll be right there to back us up.
okay, you ready?
take a deep breath. And remember, "I'm not a cop."
come on.
what the hell is she doing here?
I asked you a question. What is she doing here?
come on, Ryan. Step up. You got this.
that job you gave us last night.
that was junk, Zeke. The guy was home, alright? Alex is done.
Yeah, Alex called me. From jail. He said you got busted.
that's right, I had to bail myself out, man.
Alex beat the hell out of the guy which is why he's still in.
anyway, the point is, now I need a new partner.
alright? That's what she's doing here.
I just wanted to clear it with you, out of respect.
Ryan gets very confused sometimes.
he says things he shouldn't.
Where'd you meet her? - It's Maria.
racing pink slips out at Cherry Beach. - She can drive?
gave him a spot, six car lengths. Still smoked him.
who does she work for?
you. Starting now.
come on. Come on...
we're done here. I do the recruiting.
take a walk.
no sale.
it's alright.
could be a first step, we'll stay on Zeke.
see what he gets into.
I have to say I'm impressed. Only five hundred production models built, and last time I checked there weren't any left.
where did you find it? - I have a number of suppliers.
you mind if I take a photograph?
for my son.
these days if it doesn't happen in a photograph, it never happened. Of course.
OK, got the photo. - Do you think your son will like it?
I hope so. It's his favorite color.
nothing. It's clean.
I have friends overseas who'd be interested in this sort of thing.
is that right? - Of course, it would have to be volume.
but if you could move cars like this, 20 grand a unit?
20 thousands each? At that price they would have to be stolen.
you have the capacity for this sort of operation?
I ship things overseas, in containers.
heavy machinery, textiles, that sort of thing.
including cars.
certainly possible, why not?
you're talking to the wrong people, Mr. Ross.
that's too bad. - I'm sorry we can't help you.
well, if you change your mind.
I'm going to show this to my son.
I'll be in touch.
give our best to your boy.
once again, VIN was clean. - Nah, they've gotta be fake.
Khali ran the numbers. Paperwork's legit.
I ask for a car that's impossible to buy, and they come up with one literally overnight.
we have no way to prove that it's stolen. - Yeah, but the wife, Ellen, she was into the deal.
she was already spending the money in her head. - It was the husband that backed away?
there was something going on there, plenty of tension.
these people are careful, we've seen that with Zeke.
they're smart, so we just have to be smarter.
yeah? - It's Daniel.
Hey. - We've got action with Zeke.
we followed him to a park. He's out of his car. - What's he doing?
looks like he's meeting up with the wife, Ellen Vaughn.
just her? No husband? - Yeah, looks that way.
who, are you seeing this? - Yeah... Yeah, keep shooting.
what is it? - Ellen and Zeke.
I think we just found a way in.
so she's married to the money, but she's sleeping with the muscle.
Yeah, this is more than a one night stand.
you're sure? - Yeah, look at his hand.
on her back, there's a closeness between them, not an urgency.
she's looking into his eyes. There's trust there.
this is real for her. - So how do we use it?
I'll reach out to Ellen.
if she's looking for an exit ramp for her and her boyfriend, I'll be happy to provide.
meanwhile, Ryan delivers the photos to the husband.
he wants to prove his loyalty, and thought Davin should know what his wife is doing.
he uses it as a chance to step up. - That's a lot of pressure on Ryan.
he can handle it.
set up a meeting with Ellen, see if she bites.
all right.
Hey. Nice job with this kid. - Ryan?
anyone could've flipped him. - That's not true.
you made a genuine connection. He trusts you, Maria, he believes in you.
he looks at me, all he sees is a get out of jail free card.
don't be so sure.
we're just waiting on a signal. You remember what to say?
I'm your new partner, right? - Yeah. I'm good.
I'm gonna keep my distance, you got this.
I jacked my first car before I could drive.
me and a buddy, we swiped this minivan, drove it around the block.
I bet it was a rush.
it sounds stupid but I always thought I wouldn't be able to do it.
like it wouldn't be that easy or something.
then I started learning security systems, ignition overrides.
I could boost anything with an engine.
we used to swipe cars from the airport lot.
no one got hurt. It's like it wasn't even real.
but these guys... Everyone gets hurt.
we'll shut them down.
I always thought cops were kind of lame.
but all this?
way bigger rush than joyriding that minivan.
I guess you're probably used to it. - It never gets old.
it's gotta be tough, though.
always pretending to be someone you're not.
you ever just miss just being yourself?
Yeah. - You're good to go.
okay. Headed in.
you ready?
yeah...
it's a nice day for a walk. I'm glad you called.
I wanted to apologize for my husband.
you don't have to apologize, I understand.
he's the overbearing, controlling type.
is that what you think? - I'll tell you what's clear to me.
your partnership isn't working and if I were you, I'd ditch him. I can move your cars, Ellen.
this was a mistake.
Ellen, you're the smartest person in the room and he won't even trust your judgment.
I didn't come here for an appraisal of my marriage.
you'll have complete autonomy, you'll obtain the product,
I'll move it overseas, where I will sell it.
what kind of business do you think I'm running, exactly?
listen, do you think I just happened to come out of nowhere?
I've had my eyes on your operation for some time now.
I can help you take it to another level if you want me to.
it's up to you.
Mr. Vaughn. - Ryan, isn't it?
Zeke's not here.
actually, sir, I wanted to talk to you.
the reason I wanted to see you...
Ryan, whatever it is, you can take it up with Zeke.
you need to leave now.
this is too much for him. - Give him a second.
photos just went down.
no one knows. I swear.
why bring this to me? - Zeke is out of control, he's dangerous.
this operation should be clean, low profile.
but Zeke's got crews putting people in hospitals.
me and my partner back there, we'll do things differently.
so you want his job. You're an opportunist.
if I was, I'd be blackmailing your wife.
he's doing good.
look, I get it. I'm nobody to you, I'm nothing.
but right now, I'm the one person who isn't lying to you.
wait.
come back tonight, we'll talk.
I thought for sure he wasn't gonna go for it.
you did great in there. - So what's our next move?
we just blew up their entire foundation.
now, we show Davin that we can help put it back together.
looks like Ryan made quite the impression.
the dealership was shut up tight. No sign of Davin or the lovers.
I'm sure Davin is freaking out right now. He said he'd be in touch.
Hey, look at this, I got something.
I set up a fake website for John's import-export firm.
Ellen Vaughn just paid it a visit. - You sure it's Ellen?
Yeah, I tracked the IP address, it's her, she's checking him out.
that means she's interested. - She's making a move.
her and Zeke, that's good. They're scrambling.
if we could set up a buy we could shut this whole thing down.
Oh no, it's Ryan. Something's wrong, he's panicking.
I gotta go.
I got your text, what's wrong? - We messed up.
Zeke called me. He sounds really weird.
Davin must have told him that I ratted him out.
OK, slow down. Tell me what happened.
Zeke wants me to pick up a car from the drop spot, get it taken care of.
what does that mean? - I did this once for him.
if we get a car that's too hot, Zeke leaves it in the drop spot for me.
I have to pick it up, take it to the crushers.
so if you get busted with the car, it's on you, and Zeke just walks away.
it's usually no big deal. But this time, something's different.
I could hear it in his voice. He was ice-cold.
you think he's setting you up?
the drop spot is isolated, there's no cameras.
if I go there, anything could happen. - But we don't have a choice.
Zeke will get suspicious if we don't do what he says, right?
we?
you're not alone in this. Where's the pickup spot?
it's back that way. - Let's go.
here come my guys. We're gonna check out the car, make sure it's safe.
Hey, stay back.
we circled the perimeter twice, it's clear. We're alone.
alright, which one?
right there, red sedan. Keys are under the bumper.
it doesn't look right to me.
the back wheels are low. There's something heavy in the trunk.
Rebecca, we got eyes on the car, could be rigged with explosives.
get everyone out of there, I'm calling the bomb squad.
Oh, no, wait a second, we know Zeke is reckless and impulsive.
but... a bomb? It doesn't make sense.
especially if it's personal.
if anything, he's going to want to cave Ryan's head in with a tire iron himself.
I'm going to take a closer look.
John, are you listening to me? Keep your distance.
Rebecca, I'm losing you, you're starting to break up.
roll ETF to their location now. Bomb disposal unit.
what are you doing? - I'm gonna go take a look.
I'm right with you. - No, no, no. Both of you stay put.
only need one of us to be stupid.
homicide's working on search warrants. - Too slow.
in the meantime, our happy couple disappears.
we're running out of time, we need to get a confession.
the good news is Ellen Vaughn has reached out.
she wants a meeting with John Ross, the exporter.
so we do a double play.
while I'm working on the wife, Maria could be working on the boyfriend, Zeke.
we gotta get a matching car, same make, model as the one we found the body in.
Why? - So that Ryan can drive it back.
he got nervous, he looked in the trunk, found the body.
now he's gonna confront Zeke, all freaked out. - Seeing that car, the shock of it...
they might just fall apart. - Yeah, that's a good plan.
but does it get us a confession? - At this point, it's our best shot.
okay, we're in position.
good. Maria? - Good to go.
stand by, we're waiting on John's signal. - Okay, standing by.
any minute now.
listen, we don't know how Zeke's gonna react when he sees this car.
I do.
I got this, I know how to talk to him.
if things go South, you follow my lead.
Yeah.
when this is all over with, you ever thought about what you might do?
I've never been good at anything besides stealing cars.
you're pretty good at this. - I'm no cop.
no. But we could put you on the payroll, and you could help us out.
as a job? - Yeah, you're pretty good at this.
might be worth it, just to see the look on my mom's face.
we want to move the cars, right now, fast.
they're all ready to go, the detailed list is in my office.
I don't need a list. What I need is the history of each vehicle.
in case any issues should arise.
they're untraceable. I do the work myself.
that's not much of an assurance. My clients need more than that.
we take the VIN numbers from wrecked cars, we copy them, and we put them on ours.
but then there's no paper trail. - We make one.
you can look as deep as you want, all you find is a clean car.
we can discuss money in my office.
of course. But first I want to pick up that present for my son.
there's the cue. - Maria, you're on.
we've got them on the cars, now let's get them for murder.
OK, going in.
is everything okay?
fine. Let's step into my office.
get that out of here. - The car, or the body in the trunk?
will your husband be joining us? - No I'll be handling this.
all I need to know is if he's gonna be a problem.
can we get him on the phone? - I can't, he's unavailable.
what was the plan? I get caught dumping the car, go down for murder?
was that it? Did you really think you could get away with it?
you don't know what you're talking about.
Yeah...? So tell me.
you need to shut up, right now. Move. Outside.
come on, Ryan, let's go outside.
so you gonna kill me like you killed Davin, huh? You coward?
Ryan, that's enough. - Daniel, Jesse, start moving in.
let's go.
come on, Ryan, let's go. You shouldn't have come here.
tell me what happened, or else I'm going to the cops.
Ryan, stop! - I told you to shut up!
Ryan! No...
John, he's got a knife, get over here!
police get on the ground, don't move!
there's so much blood.
I need an ambulance at 151 Dumay, we have a civilian injured.
severe abdominal stab. - Shut up!
Ryan, listen to me, listen.
you have to stay still, okay. Ambulance is on it's way.
it happened so fast. - I know, look at me, look at me.
I want you to picture your mom's face when you tell her you work for the cops.
she'd never believe me.
you're gonna be OK, you're gonna get out of this, OK?
the ambulance is on it's way. Ryan!
Ryan, Ryan, you're gonna be okay.
I don't even know your real name.
it's Maria. Maria Cortez.
that's a really pretty name.
it's okay, you're going to be okay.
Ryan, stay still, please. Please.
please!
Mrs. Everwood?
my name is Maria, I'm a police officer.
I need to talk to you about your son, Ryan.
you people.
no, I don't know where he's living, and no, I haven't talked to him in a couple of years.
uh, Mrs. Everwood. Ryan isn't in trouble.
he was working on a case, helping police.
helping me.
helping me.
Ryan's been injured, he was stabbed.
how bad is it? - He lost a lot blood, he's gonna need surgery, but he is conscious, and...
the doctors think he's gonna be okay.
I knew this was gonna happen, I've been waiting for it.
your son stopped a lot of people from getting hurt.
he wants to make a change.
he's been asking for you.
I can take you if you'd like. - Yes, thank you.
what? Maria's blaming herself.
that kid almost died.
she'll be fine. I'll check in with her.
this job.
you spend all this time with someone and then...
you arrest them, or...
they get stabbed...
but you made a connection. You opened up to them.
you know what the tough part is?
going home at night to someone who loves you, and you have to open up to them, all over again.
I'm sorry I didn't call first. - No, it's okay.
I'm a cop.
you wanted to know what I do for a living.
okay.
and you were wrong.
I am scared of you.
you're the first guy I've connected with, in a long time.
and that kind of freaks me out.
why don't you come inside?
let's go out. Talk.
it's three in the morning.
that's okay. You'll get used to it.
just another day in the neighbourhood.
keep firing!
it didn't have to go like this.
yates, don't just sit there, return fire! Let's go!
angel! He's hit Russell.
son of a bitch. Why the hell weren't you covering him?
you're good, okay. - Yates...Yates, cover me.
yeah
he's down! He's down!
stay here.
you know this thing is amazing. I can push my ISO like crazy.
I could shoot in a closet and there would be zero noise. - Come on.
you should let me take your picture, you're a beautiful man.
I do let you; that one time in Mexico wearing the sombrero.
yeah and you were drunk and mooning me. - Go to work.
okay , COME HERE
what...
you're scared the camera's gonna reveal your deep dark secrets to me. Am I right?
what happens if you find out what a terrible person I am?
I'll take my chances. Bye.
see you tonight.
the SMASH unit. Guns and Gangs.
we think there could be a coverup. SMASH guys initiated the shoot out.
we're not convinced they had cause. We've been concerned with this unit for some time.
their tactics, their use of force. - So why haven't you pulled them from duty?
we haven't been able to prove anything. That's where you come in.
this guy was a veteran banger, Eight convictions. Trafficking, aggravated assault.
wait a second, you're actually going to go after the SMASH unit?
you think that's wise? These guys are decorated cops.
they're pretty much rock stars. - Then I'm sure you won't find anything.
and if we do? They're also well connected.
the CIU is still a new unit, this could finish us.
an assignment like this is why you're in the budget. It isn't up for debate, Rebecca.
if you think these guys aren't lying, then prove it.
that's Daniel's old unit, you know that right?
you're serious? We're working with Internal Affairs?
isn't there like a rule about looking into other cops?
Yeah, the rule is that you don't do it. - You don't even think about it.
Daniel, you ran with these guys. You want to set it up?
the SMASH unit. Some of the best cops I've worked with.
they pound the streets. They make a ton of arrests.
sometimes they get a little cowboy, not everyone understands that.
especially Internal Affairs.
angel Abano, one of their guys.
he was injured during the shoot out. They need someone to take his place.
that's going to be Jesse. He's new, they won't know him.
Daniel, I'm going to list you as a reference on Jesse's paperwork I need you to set it up.
what if I refuse? - Then you can give me a call from traffic duty, remind me how itchy that poly blend is in 80 degree heat.
??? - No!
none of you get to act like you're any more upset about this than I am. Our job is to find out the truth.
are they lying about the shooting? If so, what really happened out there?
if they're clean, we prove it and IA steps down.
we treat this like any other case.
alright, listen up.
Russell Hagler, he runs the unit.
he's the one you need to impress, he's the key to this whole thing.
you two were close?
Yeah.
Russell was my mentor, three years.
he's like a big brother.
what about that guy? -That's Russell's right-hand man; Kevin Yates.
he's a good guy, real police.
alright, let's go tell Rebecca you're ready.
Daniel will set up the first introduction.
the SMASH guys always drink at the same bar; we'll do it on their home turf.
Jesse needs to make a good first impression, his entry into the unit depends on it.
Daniel will run cover. I want everyone on their A game.
the faster we move, the faster we can close the book on this.
Yeah, tequila!
I keep thinking, we're cops, we're supposed to protect each other.
Yeah, you keep thinking that.
look, at some point, they're going to test you, okay?
it's an initiation. Just roll with it, okay?
what about you. You up for this?
hell yeah, time of my damn life.
the prodigal son returns. - I knew I smelled something when I walked in here.
you still got that halitosis problem, eh Pounds?
why don't you gimme a kiss, and you'll find out.
sure tonight's not gonna be too much action for you?
hope you're up for some drinking, my friend.
here he is, Jesse Borden, straight out of OPC.
hotshot of his class. The academy's best kept secret.
is that so? Doesn't explain why you wanna be in my unit.
ever since I was a kid. I wanted to help people.
protect them.
well, no offense kid, but we chase street waste.
you wanna save people, go be a nurse. - Hey, come on, man, you gotta settle down.
you're gonna scare the kid off before we even started.
it's GOOD TO SEE YOU. You look good, Danny Boy. C'mon, I'll buy you a drink.
thanks MAN - You gonna sit down? - How's Terri?
o, COME ON MAN. You haven't seen me since I took homicide, and you automatically think I'm with the same woman?
we're getting married this winter.
same old Danny Price. Most loyal guy I've ever known.
hey look man, how's Angel?
he's doing alright, he's tough.
you hear Yates is retiring? - Yeah?
he's getting old and soft. I need somebody young.
this Jesse kid looks straight laced.
yeah - Is he going to fit in?
Yeah, He's good, scrappy. I know his brother.
don't let the pretty boy routine fool you. He's a tough kid.
drink up, Jesse, they're on the house.
they know we're cops?
kid, everybody here knows who we are.
we'll set up a cover apartment for Jesse. It'll be fully wired.
Khali will set up cameras and mics. Full coverage.
there's something going on with Yates. He's hiding something.
I got a hit off him. - Look, you're the new guy on the team.
they're going to be watching you, all of them. - I don't know,
Yates felt different, he's more intense.
allright, Then you keep an eye on him, alright? Don't make up stories.
Hey, come here.
I want you to go easyon him. If he tells you he got a hit, you listen.
look, I don't need a pep talk right now. - Is there something you're not telling me?
it's business. Let's just do the job.
get some sleep.
how you doing? - I've been better.
I've got cameras and mics in place. They'll be up by tomorrow.
full coverage, everything except... - Except bedroom?
good night, Jesse.
I miss you.
you need to sleep.
and I need to get out of here before I do something stupid. So...
talk to you later, okay?
you feel like taking a ride? - Hey, what's going on?
we working tonight?
Hey, what are you doing?
this won't hurt a bit.
don't move until I tell you.
so, think you can just show up out of nowhere and join my unit?
this is the real deal, kid. You got what it takes to be here?
Yeah. I think so. - No, you either do or you don't!
screw you.
good. That's more like it.
NOW...There are three kilos of H inside that house, maybe more.
you're going to go in there and get it for me.
what about a warrant? - Don't worry about that, we've got it covered.
move!
you want to run with SMASH, learn to improvise.
now go.
?????????
police! Don't move!
we have a warrant to search the premises. PUT THE WEAPON DOWN - You can't just come into my house.
C'mon, Andre, be a good boy; Tell us where the drugs are.
screw you man, not till I see your warrant.
you wanna see my warrant, Andre?
let's just see if I can find my warrant, huh.
Nope. Not here.
Hey, hey! Don't touch that.
that was my mom's stuff.
no
what do you think, Russell? Should I leave this stuff alone?
you know what we came for.
Uhh-uhh. All right.
come on, Andre, where are the drugs?
that's ENOUGH - COME ON
no, no, no. Leave that alone, don't touch it.
what are you doing man? You said this was your mom's stuff.
this must be your mom, then. - Put that down.
put it down. - I'll put it right over here.
how far down you think this thing goes, Andre?
you wanna take a guess? - C'mon, where's the drugs?
you better tell him, Andre.
stop!
there she goes. - No!
be smart. We're not leaving without the stuff.
it's up to you how hard you wanna make this.
okay, you're the boss.
okay! Okay! Okay!
I'll tell you. Just stop!
what? - It's in the air conditioner out back. All of it.
give me that.
ha HA, Mama's boy.
you're sick, kid, you know that, right?
and you, you're getting off lucky.
yates, you found us.
I thought we weren't doing this tonight.
yeah well, I guess I forgot to call you.
what went on here tonight, you like it?
is that your style?
I was just doing my job, man. - Yeah?
it only gets worse from here.
you better get ready.
so last night, SMASH unit broke into a civilian's house, trashed it, and threatened him with violence.
they didn't lay a single charge.
look, I don't know it would get out of hand like that.
he was trying to impress Russell, and it worked. - It was an initiation and Jesse passed, with flying colors.
what happened last night was good. He's in.
we're trying to prove the unit's doing things by the book. If last night's any indication...
last night doesn't prove anything.
sometimes you gotta bend the rules. These guys know that.
you're telling me you would go into someone's house, damage their property, threaten them.
yes I would, if I had to.
three kilos of heroin went into lock up early this morning, care of SMASH unit.
silver lining?
the second in command, Yates. He wasn't there for the raid.
showed up later. - You said there was tension?
big time. - All right.
that's a crack. If they're on the outs, Russell's going to be looking for allies.
I want you to stay close, show him you're going to be loyal.
Hey, there's no reason to let IA know about last night's stunt. Right?
don't tell me you're not concerned? - The SMASH unit they know the law.
they play in the grey when they need to. I've seen you bend rules before Rebecca.
don't give me the brotherhood speech. I'm a cop, I know what it means to protect each other.
and here comes the "But."
if this is how these guys operate, you don't think they'd cover up an illegal shooting?
you're part of a murder now, you know.
you passed the test.
what are you talking about a "murder"?
you know everybody thinks eagles are baddass 'cause they fly alone, but they got nothing on crows.
you fly alone, you get yourself killed.
okay, The unit, is like a murder of crows.
Crows'll gather to decide the capital fate of another. Make their own laws.
we're in a war against the streets, we can't win, Jesse.
you gotta choose which side of the battle you're on.
here, double cream, double sugar.
Hey! Police don't move!
you don't know what you're doing, man. It looks like I got you on unlawful possession.
you don't want to do that.
and what's this? Possession for the purposes of.
Jesse, you've gotta stop.
let him go. - Are you serious?
he's got like 3 grams here; I just found a . 38 in his underwear.
that little bit? Time we spend processing this guy.
you wanna tell me what the hell's going on with Russell IH THERE?
Yeah, I'd like to coach, but I'm pretty much in the dark myself.
get in the car.
don't move. - Wait a second.
you see this? He just gave him his gun back.
I'm bringing the kid in. You stay with Jesse.
Lucas Smith, AKA Baby Luke.
did a stint in juvie, no arrests in 3 years. Known member of the Marvo Crew.
which is the biggest gang in the SMASH unit's jurisdiction.
if they're so big how come there are hardly any arrests in here?
the Marvo Crew run a pretty good racket
must be nice to move all that dope, while SMASH unit looks the other way.
how much you pay them? - SMASH, what's SMASH?
I don't know what you're talking about, lady.
no? Then why did they let you walk when they found drugs and a gun on you today?
didn't let me walk far, I'm in here aren't I? - It was my people who brought you in, not SMASH.
C'mon, Luke, how much are you paying those cops? - It's got to be enough to make it worth their while, right?
I've got nothing to say to you so why don't you run and get my lawyer now?
see, that's the good news. You don't need a lawyer.
we're going to let you go.
but first we're gonna put a call into the SMASH guys and tell them what you said.
how you told us all about them. How they're taking bribes, how they're dirty...
whoa, whoa, I didn't say any of that.
okay. We'll just sit back and watch.
you don't have to rat them out. We just wait to see what they do to you.
and that will be our evidence, right?
all right look, I'll take the charge, plead guilty, whatever you want. All right just...
please, don't do this.
you're really that afraid of them? You need to tell me why.
I'll get someone to escort you out of here. Come on.
let me go! Wait. Alright!
you put it out there I'm a rat they're both gonna want me dead.
both?
what's that supposed to mean? - Don't you get it?
they're working together. Those cops and the Marvo Crew, they partnered up.
they're working the hood together.
smash is running the whole show.
alright, sit down.
stick with me, Jesse, I'll take care of you.
I can be your best friend, don't forget that.
see these guys, M3 Colts. Used to run this neighborhood, before we came in and cleaned it up.
wanna make an arrest so badly? Let's make one.
we're good here, Russell, it's fine. These guys are clean.
doesn't look fine to me.
Jesse, check the backseat, tell me what you see.
what are you doing, Russell?
nothing in there. - Nothing in there.
Really?
really now, Russell.
what's this?
congrats, kid. You get to make your first arrest.
I was pissed enough that Internal Affairs was poking around, - then I get your call. - Sir.
do you have any idea... - The shooting wasn't clean, sir.
the SMASH unit is allied with a gang, the Marvo Crew.
they shot that kid over turf. - You know this, how?
some scumbag drug dealer told you? I mean the kid's looking for a deal, Rebecca.
accusing four cops is a suicide play, not a deal.
my guys witnessed Russell Hagler returning a weapon to a gang member.
I could arrest him right now.
look, I hate this as much as you do. - You want to hand this off to me, is that why you called?
no sir, I want to pursue it.
if we don't, we're choosing to look the other way. There's a point where the brotherhood ends.
the information you've come across could be nothing. - It isn't.
whatever your guys think they saw... we don't know what that was.
so you're planning to bury this? - Hey, careful.
if you pursue this, and you're wrong? You'll go down, hard.
this unit, your career, whatever you thought you knew, will be gone.
due respect, sir, you need to start thinking about what could happen if I'm right.
if you're right, I'll protect you.
but so far, Detective Sergeant? I'm unconvinced.
you think that kid Luke's telling the truth?
smash is working with the Marvos.
looks that way, yeah.
I want everyone in briefing, now.
you need to think about your reputation, your future as cops.
it's your decision.
if you go after other police, that's going to stick.
so this Luke kid, his word is iron clad?
Daniel, you watched Russell hand that weapon back to that kid yourself.
Jesse saw him planting drugs. - So why aren't we picking him up?
because I want them all. The entire unit.
I'm not ordering you to do this. It's up to you.
from this point on, if you move forward with this operation it's because you chose to.
alright, so we're with you. - Okay.
we believe that SMASH is in bed with The Marvo Crew. - According to Luke, the Marvos get a free pass.
their rivals, the M3 Colts, get nailed every time.
part of what they seize, they re-sell on the streets.
the rest goes into lock up. - That's a lot of drug money.
so what about Yates? He's unhappy.
he's already leaving the unit. - Could mean he's ready to flip.
we need to reach out to him.
Russell's all over me. I can't get near Yates.
what if I can?
look, this is my unit, not SMASH.
let's do this.
I thought only girls smoked those.
you're just jealous 'cause I make these look good.
yeah you keep telling yourself that. What's going on?
you seen Jesse? I tried calling him.
Yeah, He's with Russell, we got squad soon.
no. You should go easy, you got shift soon.
takes the edge off. - I heard you were retiring man.
I remember when this unit meant everything to you. - Used to mean something to you too.
Yeah, It wasn't easy walking away. Trust me.
going a little too far, kicking some ass to get the bad guy.
it's not like that anymore.
we crossed over, Danny.
I SHOULD've done it back then.
just like you. Drawn my line in the sand.
you can do that now. - Why do you think I'm getting out?
you care about that kid Jesse, you'll get him out too.
hey Yates, is there something going on?
is there something happening between you and Russ?
it's Russell.
I gotta go.
hold on, hold on. Just a second.
what's going on? Is there something I need to know?
you keep an eye on Jesse, alright?
Jesse, what's happening?
m3 Colts have a stash house. Russell got a tip.
he wants to do a takedown now, before they catch wind and move the product.
alright you keep an eye on the drugs. I'll call Rebecca. You gimme that location.
all RIGHT
front door. We stay together on this one.
you two hang back, Yates and I will take the lead.
they're going in.
yates, upstairs, let's go.
Jesse, let's go! Come on.
get your head out of your ass. - Jesse's stalling, something's up.
easy, easy.
what the hell is going on?
he shot Yates.
officer Borden. You need to come with me.
I've got questions about what happened today.
we gotta get him out of there.
stay in the car. I don't want to burn him.
I've got this.
I want Jesse protected.
tell me you'll take care of him. - Rebecca.
if it gets out that he went undercover on cops, it will chase him for the rest of his career.
who the hell do you think you're talking to? - Either he walks away from this unscathed, or I will personally make sure that everyone on this force knows that the reason Detective Yates died is because you wouldn't back me.
you'll be going down for this, not me.
it's been forever. How do you think he's doing in there?
we'll see. Here he comes now.
I think Russell killed him.
I think he shot Yates and planted the gun on that kid at the scene.
it was the way he was moving around in that room. It was the way he looked.
did you tell them that?
no, I can't just accuse another cop.
Jesse, look at me.
you gotta be sure.
he did it. I'm sure.
Yates wanted out. He was leaving the unit.
Russell thought he was gonna blow the whistle on them. I sure of it.
we'll retake Officer Calvert's statement immediately, and go from there.
you're going to be discreet, you're going to take his name out of this. - Come on, that's not going to happen.
he'll be crucified. - A cop has been accused of murdering another cop, Rebecca.
there's no way this doesn't get ugly.
staff Inspector Harrison...
has no authority here, this is IA's investigation, Rebecca.
either Jesse saw it or he didn't. I want his statement.
we need proof. I'm not putting Jesse out there on his own.
alright, then we stay under. We get to Russell first, before he feels the heat.
Rebecca wants everybody in the briefing room. - She can wait.
Yates was a friend of mine. There's no way.
Russell is capable of a lot of things, but not that.
I know what I saw. - Then you saw wrong.
I'll tell her you're coming.
middle of a raid, gunshots, things get foggy.
it's hard to know what exactly you saw, Jesse. - Maybe you've got tunnel vision.
this is hard for you, I get that. But if Jesse's right, he needs backup.
he also needs proof. He's the one on the line here.
Yates was about to retire from the unit. Russell was paranoid he was going to talk.
let's use that paranoia. - Could be our best way in.
Daniel, you know Russell the best. You tell us.
look, if this is true, maybe Jesse can call him, tell him he wants out of the unit.
we need to make Russell feel like he's losing control.
he'll be worried what Jesse saw at the raid. He'll want to come see him.
okay Jesse, you talk to him, you got to open up.
tell him you're freaking out about what you saw in the house. You got to get him to talk, alright?
you okay?
Yeah. I'm good.
alright let's get to work.
you nervous?
Yeah.
me too.
let me hear the audio again.
can you say something? Give us a level.
Russell, I've been thinking.
I've been thinking it over, and it's not for me.
that's good, we're good. We're ready.
Jesse... Yeah.
you' got this, okay? You can do it.
heads up.
okay Jesse, they're coming to the door.
you alone? - Yeah.
I know what happened was tough, alright?
but it doesn't mean you need to leave the unit.
I been thinking about SMASH, what you guys do.
it's just not for me. - What we do?
pounds, what's that mean, "What we do"?
beats me. What's that mean, Slick?
so let me get this straight. NOW...
you want to leave.
look, Jesse, I can't let that happen. - Nope.
no can do, J-bird.
Russell's too paranoid, he's not going to talk.
if you do leave, we have no chance but to tell everyone the truth.
truth?
truth about you.
see, we paid Andre a visit this morning.
turns out he remembers this night pretty clearly.
mostly you, you kicking in his front door, waving a gun in his face.
Yeah, he remembers that real clear.
I was just doing what you guys told me to do.
I never told you to intimidate anyone.
destroy his possessions. I didn't tell you that, did I?
that's heavy badge syndrome. You couldn't be controlled.
Russell was trying to give you a shot and you - you blew it.
fact is, the whole time we worked with you, you were breaking into houses, planting drugs, falsifying reports.
total behaviour problem.
now, kinda makes sense, given where you came from.
read your file, kid, you grew up in Southside.
just another lonely kid looking to belong, right? The only problem is you're nothing but trouble.
I sure hope you're tired of being a cop, Jesse.
because you are done.
what's he talking about?
Russell's not going to give us anything. He's going to try to destroy Jesse's credibility.
what's he doing?
he's going inside.
what is he thinking?
I don't know.
what are you doing? - I trusted you. How could you do this?
let's get the hell out of here man, we gotta go.
Danny. What the hell man?
you going to tell me what's going on?
listen to me. Just trust me, we gotta get out of here.
no, No one goes anywhere until you tell me what's going on.
listen, I got a buddy, alright.
he's got his ear to the ground, and he gave me a call.
ia, the kid's on the job, he's working you.
look, I'm sorry, I screwed up.
I would've never brought him near you, if I knew.
yo, Russell, what's up, you're making me nervous over here.
the kid's working us.
Hey, come on man, calm down.
check the place, it's wired.
where is it?
where is it?
where is it?
I don't know.
you little bitch.
Russell, COME ON, MAN. RUSSELL, RELAX. RELAX, MAN - I'm screwed, Danny. - Okay.
so, what if the kid saw you get a little out of line.
everyone knows that's what we do, that's part of the job.
Russell, what are we doing man; we should get out of here. - Shut up and let me think!
I JUST... I JUST... I just need to think. I just need to think.
you.
you introduced this kid to me.
Yeah, Russ, I came to find you, I came to make this go away. - How do I know you're not wired?
Russ. Come on!
the Bardi crew. Eight years ago, you remember that?
that big takedown we did? Remember that guy that was mouthing off too much?
Costa Sanchez. You beat him up pretty bad, Russ.
he ended up dying in hospital later.
I didn't report that.
I protected you.
we're recording this. Does he know that?
what the hell are you doing Daniel? - And if I was wearing a wire would I say all of this?
I'm just as guilty as you.
Russ, come on we're brothers, man. I had your back then.
don't I have it now?
but you gotta talk to me, you gotta tell me what's going on Russell.
what did you do?
Russ, what the hell is going on?
I'm in a lot of debt man. - Money?
so, you took some money you shouldn't have, man.
what else? We all get tempted. What else?
Russell! This place is wired.
it doesn't matter, not anymore.
he was going to squeal.
he was going to hurt us. All of us.
Daniel, I needed him gone.
Russell! - Shut up!
are you talking about Yates, Russell?
Russell, did you shoot Yates?
he told me he wasn't gonna let it go.
I had to, for us, didn't I?
Daniel, I am in so deep man.
I shouldn't have protected you back then.
I'm taking you in.
you think you're better than me, is that it?
you would have done the same thing. We are the same.
we're not the same.
not now.
not ever.
what happened with Daniel? - Daniel was a rookie cop when he was with SMASH.
a kid too scared to go against the force.
that was my argument, to the Chief Inspector.
okay.
and he bought it?
that could have gone a different way.
I could've been wrong.
you guys all followed me in, and I could've been wrong.
Yeah, but you weren't.
look, Rebecca, what you did today.
taking on the brass. IA. You put your team first.
no other cop I know would have been able to do that.
no other cop, would've had the strength.
Russell said this thing to me. About the streets, what we do...
how we're fighting a war that we can never win.
you think he's right?
so what's the point of all this, then?
the war's not out there, it's in here.
up to you how long you want to fight.
good job today.
what's this, what are you guys doing?
buying my friend Terri a drink, thought you might want to join us?
you okay?
alright, I'm going to get a... Yeah. YEAH, YEAH
Hey, Coach.
I think I can use that pep talk now.
you seemed to be doing fine on your own today.
but, if I was, I'd tell you, you don't owe him anything, Daniel.
you know that, right? - Guy made me the cop I am today.
no. You made the cop that you are today.
with a little help from us.
what? - Thanks, man.
no problem.
hey can I get a beer? - Sure.
so. Do you want to talk about it now or later?
later. Okay?
I'm not going anywhere.

Flash-back to kinder, gentler times...
on the Pleasantville marathon...
this Friday only on...
I mean, hi.
look, you probably don't think...
I should be asking you this.
I mean, not knowing you well and all.
I--I mean, I know you. Everybody knows you.
I just don't know you... technically.
anyhow...
I don't know what you're doing this weekend...
but my mom's leaving town...
and she's letting me borrow the car, so, you know...
Okey-dokey, so just give me a call.
let me know.
Bye.
for those of you going on to college next year...
the chance of finding a good job will actually decrease by the time you graduate.
the available number of entry-level jobs will drop 31% over the next four years.
median income for those jobs will go down as well.
obviously, my friends, it's a competitive world...
and good grades are your only ticket through.
in fact, by the year 2000...
...chance of contracting HlV from a non-monogamous life will climb to 1 in 150.
the odds of dying in an auto accident are only 1 in 2500.
now, this marks a drastic increase from 14 years ago when ozone depletion was at just 10% of its current level.
by the time you are 30 years old...
average global temperature will have risen 2 1/2 degrees...
causing such catastrophic consequences as typhoons, floods, widespread drought, and famine.
OK, who can tell me what famine is?
honey, I'm home.
Hello, darling. How was your day?
Oh, swell. You know, Mr. Connell says...
if things keep going the way they are...
I might be seeing that promotion sooner than I thought.
Oh, darling, that's wonderful.
I always knew you could do it.
Hey, pumpkin, what's that smell? Is that your meat loaf?
it might be.
Oh, pumpkin, you sure know the way...
to this man's heart.
no, that was not the deal.
no, you have custody first weekend of every month.
this is the first weekend.
no. I'm not gonna bail you out.
I'm going out of town this weekend.
Barry, if I want to have a mud bath with my new boyfriend...
that's my business, isn't it?
Hey, where are those kids?
right behind you, Father.
mother, Father, Bud has a little surprise for you.
what's that, Bud?
first place in the science fair.
there were lots of swell projects.
I guess mine was just the swellest.
darling, that's wonderful...
except there's no such word as "swellest."
well, gee whiz, Mom, it wasn't the English fair.
[Laughter]
no, that's not the point.
the point is, you're supposed to see them.
fine. See them another time.
what's a mother to do?
OK, in the very first Pleasantville episode...
whose window did Bud break...
when he was playing with his father's golf clubs?
easy. Mr. Jenkins.
what job did Mr. Jenkins have?
salesman.
what did they name the cat they found in the gutter?
scout?
marmalade.
all right, all right.
here's one.
why did their parents come home early from their weekend at the lake?
cause Bud didn't answer the phone...
and they were worried about him.
Man...you're unbelievable.
you'll win this thing for sure. When is it on?
marathon starts at 6: 30, contest is tomorrow at noon.
thousand bucks, huh? And it's on all night?
of course. That's why they call it a marathon.
Oh, my God, he is so pathetic.
I can't believe you're related to him.
only on my parents' side.
Yeah, but you guys are twins and stuff.
you must be from the cool side of the uterus.
Oh, my God, here they come.
Oh, my God, just don't do anything.
what?
saw you at the mall yesterday.
Yeah, I saw you, too.
so, you gonna watch the concert on MTV tonight?
Yeah. You?
my mom's gonna be out of town.
cool. -Cool.
it was so amazing, Daph.
I was, like, "My mom's gonna go out of town."
and he was like, "Well, maybe we could..."
and I was, "Yeah, sure." And he was, "Cool."
I know. He's so smart.
I'm thinking about that red thing I got at the mall.
it's not slutty.
it's fun.
well, hello, he's not coming over to study.
Yeah, I know.
well, sometimes I'm jealous of you, too.
he's not homeless, Howard. They don't say where he lives.
well, it's a silly question.
because nobody's homeless in Pleasantville.
cause that's just not what it's like.
look, Howard, it's almost 6: 30.
I gotta go.
what are you doing? -What are you doing?
cut it out, David. Mark Davis is gonna be here in minutes.
great. The Pleasantville marathon starts at 6: 30.
I don't believe this! He's gonna be here!
you can watch it upstairs.
upstairs?!
it doesn't have any stereo!
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!
David, stop stressing. You can turn it on normally.
no, I can't. It's a new TV, Jen.
it doesn't work without a remote.
Oh, my God, he's here!
TV repair.
TV repair?
Yeah. TV busted?
well, here I am.
holy cow, look at that.
had a little disaster, didn't you, fella?
well, yeah, sort of.
well, we'll get you fixed up in no time.
I know how I'd feel if mine went out.
almost like losing a friend.
you know, we didn't call any TV repair.
that makes it a lucky day for both of us, doesn't it?
do you think you could do this soon?
it's almost 6: 30. -What's the hurry?
Pleasantville marathon starts at 6: 30.
Pleasantville? Gosh, I love that show.
watched it for years.
that's not the reason. I've got a date at 6: 30.
who did Muffin take to the masquerade ball...
when her date came down with the measles?
her father. -That's right.
and how'd she dress him? -As Prince Charming.
nice. Remember the one where Bud lost his cousin...
when he was supposed to be watching him?
what department store did they go to?
Mclntyre's. -McGinty's.
no. Mclntyre's. Remember?
for the very best in men's attire
head right down to Mclntyre's
that's right.
listen...
why don't you take this remote instead?
it's got a little more oomph in it.
oomph?
sure. Big beautiful set like that?
you want something that'll put you right in the show.
it's great. We'll take it.
thank you.
well, I better get going.
your show's almost on...
and it's almost time for your date.
take care now.
whether it's on the track at Indy...
or driving around the block, only new Pennzoil...
for program information...
honey, I'm home.
great.
let me see that.
no way.
gee whiz, Mary Sue, why can't I borrow your radio?
I promised Betty Jean she could use it.
do you mind?
this is only the most important moment of my life!
forget it, Jen! I've waited a year for this!
come on, David, just give it to me!
forget it! -No way, Bud!
forget it, Mary Sue!
come on, Bud! It's mine! Give it back!
Oh, my God.
what happened? -I'm not sure.
Hi, Sport. Hi, Muffin.
better get a move on. You'll be late for school.
what did you do? -I don't know.
look at me! I'm pasty!
over here!
told you it was your lucky day.
I bet you thought I was just a fan or something.
what happened?
a miracle. Every time I thought I'd found someone...
they'd turn out to disappoint me.
they'd know the early episodes, but not the later ones.
they'd know all about Muffin, but not about Bud.
what the hell is going on?
can't talk like that here.
you're in...Well, you know.
bud, Mary Sue, breakfast is on the table.
we're in Pleasantville?
a dream come true, huh?
listen, this really isn't funny.
I have a very important date in five minutes!
you don't have to worry about that anymore.
bitch.
you have got to get us out of here!
why would I do that? -Because we don't belong!
sure you do. Mclntyre's department store...
their father dressed as Prince Charming.
that was gorgeous, Bud.
my name is David! -Oh, God!
this is a strange way of showing your appreciation.
Hey, we appreciate it. We really do.
we just want to go home now.
but you don't know how long I've looked for someone like you.
I'm very disappointed.
in fact, I'm starting to get a little upset.
no, don't get upset.
well, wouldn't you? You look for someone for years.
you pour your heart into it
this is a privilege, you know!
I don't think I'd better talk about this now.
where are you going?
I don't think we should discuss this until I'm composed.
wait a minute!
maybe in a while when I'm not so emotional!
give you a week or two to change your attitude!
come back!
come back!
a week or two?
Oh, God.
what's gonna happen?
I don't know. It's not possible. Is it possible?
bud, Mary Sue, your breakfast is getting cold.
it can't be possible.
well, come on, kids.
you're not going to school without breakfast inside you.
forward march.
I just love you in that sweater, Mary Sue.
it's so flattering.
Thanks.
morning, kids.
better get a move on, or you'll be late for school.
I don't believe this.
neither do l.
well, come on, dig in.
I put blueberries in them just the way you like.
well, come on, sweetie, it's getting late.
actually, I'm not hungry.
nonsense, young lady.
you're gonna start your day off with a nice, big breakfast.
here we go. Sit down.
here's some pancakes and eggs.
sausage and some good crisp bacon.
and, of course, a ham steak.
you eat on up, then it's off to school.
hurry, hurry.
I'm gonna hurl, David, I swear to God.
just take deep breaths.
it's all that animal fat. I can feel it in my pores.
I still don't see why we're doing this.
because we're supposed to be in school.
we're supposed to be at home.
we're supposed to be in color!
Oh, God!
Hello, Bud.
Hello, Mr. Simpson.
hear your dad's got a new car.
Oh, yeah. A Buick. It's swell.
great.
do you know that guy?
Yeah. He owns the hardware store.
you listen to me for just a minute!
I don't know what you've done, but you better fix it!
I had a date with Mark Davis, and I even bought new underwear!
we have to play along until that guy shows up again.
play along?
Yes! I am Bud Parker, and you are Mary Sue.
no. I'm not gonna do it.
if I don't dress like this for Mom...
I'm sure not gonna do it for you!
we have no choice, Jen.
we are stuck here until that guy shows up again.
why can't we just explain it to somebody?
to who?
go! Go! Go!
here, kitty.
Oh, God.
we are.
we're stuck in Nerdville.
I knew you'd pay a price for this.
I knew you couldn't be so hopelessly geek-ridden for so long without suffering some really tragic consequences.
but it's just not fair.
I was getting really popular.
Debbie Russell transferred to another school...
and my skin was really great since March.
mark Davis was finally starting to come around.
Hello, Mary Sue.
what's all the commotion? Where's the cat?
it's...
right.
I'll see you at school, Mary Sue.
who's that?
skip Martin, captain of the basketball team.
does he like me?
as a matter of fact, he does.
those are my friends?
Peggy Jane, Lisa Anne, Betty Jean.
can we do any better?
I don't think so.
last week, class, we discussed the geography of Main Street.
this week we're going to be talking about Elm Street.
now, can anyone tell me the difference...
between Elm Street and Main Street?
Tommy.
it's not as long?
that's right, Tommy. It's not as long.
also, it only has houses...
so the geography of Main Street is different than the geography of Elm Street.
Yeah. What's outside of Pleasantville?
I don't understand.
outside of Pleasantville.
what's at the end of Main Street?
Mary Sue, you should know the answer to that.
the end of Main Street is just the beginning again.
come on, men, let's go!
that's it, men, keep it up. Big game tomorrow.
Hiya, Bud.
Hiya, Skip.
Hiya, Bud.
Hiya, Skip.
bud, can I ask you a question?
sure.
well...
if I was to go up to your sister...
what I mean is, if I was to go up to Mary Sue
Oh, my God. Are we in that episode?
what? -I don't believe this.
what's the matter?
you want to ask her out tonight and give her your school pin.
Yeah. How'd you know?
look, Skip, I don't think...
it's a real good time for that right now.
what do you mean?
well, what I mean is...
Mary Sue's a little different lately.
she won't go out with me?
no, hey, I didn't say that.
I don't know what I'd do if she wouldn't go out with me.
come here, guys. Don't touch it. Stay back.
I'm sure we'll work something out.
I thought you liked him. -Yeah, but I don't know.
one date, Jen. That's all I'm asking.
if you don't go out with this guy...
we could throw their whole universe out of whack.
it's too weird, David. This place gives me the creeps.
did you know the books are blank?
what? -I went in the library.
they have covers and nothing inside of them.
what were you doing in a library?
I got lost. Oh, wait, look at this.
know why the firemen only rescue cats out of trees?
nothing burns around here. -Jen, stop!
they don't even need firemen! I could really use a cigarette!
Jen, listen. I will get us out of here.
I really will, but if we don't play along...
we can alter their whole existence...
and then we may never get home.
you really think anybody's gonna notice...
if I don't have a chocolate malt with this guy?
you won't believe what we just heard!
skip's gonna ask you out! -That's not all!
he's gonna give you his pin!
are you sure I'm supposed to wear this?
I could kill a guy with these things.
it's in your closet.
I've worn kinky stuff before
he won't notice anyway. -Why not?
they just don't notice that kind of thing around here.
so what's the point? -Jen, please.
hello. I've got three pounds of underwire on here.
just go with the program. I'm late for work.
work?
Yeah, sorry. I just had to help my folks...
and then I couldn't find my hat.
I didn't know what to do.
what's wrong?
well, I always wipe down the counter...
and then you set out the napkins and glasses...
and then I make the French fries.
but you didn't come so I just kept on wiping.
I'm sorry.
you know, if this ever happens again...
you can make the fries...
even if I haven't put out the napkins yet.
thank you.
there aren't any cheeseburgers.
what?
usually, I put out the burger and you finish with the lettuce.
OK, listen. Do you have the lettuce?
have you cooked the burgers?
put on the lettuce, finish the burger...
and pretend it was me doing it the whole time.
you can do it, really.
I sure am glad you said you'd come out with me tonight.
well, gee whiz, Skip. I sure am glad you asked me.
I don't know if I ever said this to you before...
but I think you're just about the keenest girl in the whole school.
really, Skip? The keenest?
Oh, yeah.
what can I get you two?
I don't know, Bud.
I guess I'll have my usual cheeseburger and a cherry coke.
I don't know, Bud. I'll have a salad and an Evian.
cheeseburger it is.
you see?
the whole time we were in Civics together...
I really wanted to come over and sit next to you...
but you were always sat between Lisa Anne and Peggy Jane.
and you always seemed so smart and everything.
like that report you did on our town hall.
gosh. I didn't know what I'd talk to you about.
Yeah. Well, sometimes talking's overrated.
don't you think?
Oh, right.
so I know I haven't been steady with anybody or anything...
but I just don't want to rush it.
there's kids that are even holding hands already...
but I figure there's plenty of time for that later on.
can you excuse me for just a second?
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
did he give it to you? -I bet he did.
I don't think he knows how.
I bet he's gonna take her to Lovers Lane.
I bet he is.
I bet he's even gonna hold her hand.
so, anyhow, I really wanted to sit next to you in Civics
you want to get out of here? -What?
do you want to go somewhere?
but where could we go?
lovers Lane.
lovers Lane?
Yeah, Lover's Lane. You up for it?
come on.
come on.
Oh, shit.
Jennifer!
Jennifer, stop!
stop!
you can't do this, Jennifer! He doesn't exist!
you can't do this to someone who doesn't exist!
it sure is pretty.
Oh, yeah. Gorgeous.
to be honest, Mary Sue, I didn't think you'd want...
to come here until we'd been pinned for a little while.
Oh, Skip, you can pin me anytime you want to.
or maybe I should just pin you.
that's silly, Mary Sue.
how could you possibly pin me?
son, what's wrong?
have you seen Mary Sue?
no. She's still out with Skip. Is something the matter?
no. I was just worried about her.
bud, your sister's getting older now.
she'll naturally be going out with boys.
but she's a fine young woman.
she would never do anything for us to be concerned about.
honest.
I think I better go home now, Mary Sue.
Why?
I think I might be ill.
something's happening to me.
that's supposed to happen.
it is?
Yeah. Trust me.
do you want some more cookies?
no, thanks. I'm fine.
how about some marshmallow rice squares?
those are swell.
no, I'm fine, thank you.
who could that be? -I've got it.
Hi. You took off so quick I wasn't sure you were OK.
no, I'm fine. I just had to get home early.
you know how when we close up...
I close the register, then you lower the blinds...
and I turn out the lights, and we both lock the doors?
well, you weren't around this time...
so I did the whole thing by myself.
Wow.
and I didn't even do it in the same order.
first I lowered the blinds, then I closed the register.
Hello, Betty.
Hello, Bill.
OK, well, that's great. Thank you for stopping by.
I appreciate it.
I'll see you tomorrow.
well, gee, thanks, Skip. I sure had a wonderful time.
me, too.
night.
Hello, Mr. Johnson.
Oh, hello, Mary Sue.
what did you do to him? -Nothing.
what do you mean, "nothing"? That's not nothing.
why don't you relax, Bud? We had a nice time.
I am really sleepy, and I have to wake up...
early in the morning to go to school. Night.
Hi. Looks like it's gonna be another beautiful sunny day.
high 72, low 72, not a cloud in the sky.
it's 8: 00 in the morning. Are you watching television?
Oh, no.
come on, men. Let's get in positions.
we got a big game next week. Let's go.
come on.
Oh, my God.
you can't do this, Jennifer. I warned you.
so what's the big deal?
OK. They're not good at basketball anymore.
Oh, my God. What a tragedy.
you don't understand.
you're messing with their whole goddamn universe.
maybe it needs to be messed with, David.
did that ever occur to you?
Hey, M. S. how you doing?
cool, P. J. how you doing?
cool. Cool.
cool.
cool? What are you doing to these people?
lf I don't, who will? -But they're happy.
nobody is happy in a poodle skirt and a sweater set.
you really like this, don't you?
no, it's not like you think it's funny or dorky.
you really like it.
no. You have it all wrong.
I am personally mortified to be your sister.
you have no right to do this to them.
David, listen to me for just a minute.
they don't want to be geeks. They want to be attractive.
they have a lot of potential. They just don't know any better.
they don't have that kind of potential.
Oh, yeah? Look at that.
Wow. What happened to your gum?
I gotta go.
I'm gonna meet Skip at the flagpole.
well, I don't think it's anything to worry about.
you cut down on greasy foods and chocolate.
you know, things like that.
it'll probably just clear up on its own.
Jesus Christ.
do you think we could have two cheeseburgers...
and some cherry cokes?
I'll be right with you.
Thanks.
two cheeseburgers, two cherry cokes.
there aren't any cheeseburgers.
I thought we talked about this.
what's the point, Bud?
you make hamburgers. That is the point.
no. I know I do.
it's always the same, you know?
grill the bun, flip the meat, melt the cheese.
it never changes. It never gets better or worse.
OK, just listen for a second.
the other night when I closed by myself, that was different.
forget about that!
I really liked it, though.
come here.
look.
you can't always like what you do.
sometimes you just gotta do it because it's your job.
and even if you don't like it, you just gotta do it anyway.
Why?
so they can have their hamburgers!
I'm sorry.
you know what I really like?
what's that? -Christmas time.
see, every year on December 3...
I get to paint the Christmas decorations in the window...
and every year I get to paint a different thing.
here, I'll show you.
Wow. That's pretty good.
Thanks, but this morning I was thinking...
and I realized that I look forward to it all year.
and then I thought, Gee, that seems awfully silly.
lt seems like a long time to wait for just one moment.
don't you think?
well, don't you?
I think that you should try not to think about that anymore.
I'll try that, then.
morning, Jim. -How are you, Bill?
have they ever lost before?
basketball? No, they sure haven't.
it just feels wrong, that's all.
maybe that's where they get that saying...
you can't win them all.
that's a good point, Ralph. They do have that saying.
but they do win them all. They've always won them all.
Mr. Mayor, here. Go ahead.
don't be silly, Roy. I couldn't possibly take your spot.
what I want to know is, if they've never lost before...
and they've never tied before, isn't that winning them all?
he's right. That's what you call it.
Yeah, that's true.
he said it would clear up on its own...
if she just stayed away from fried foods and sweets.
except it's spread to her lips now, too.
Oh, I don't know.
and you say it was just red?
well, you know, like real red.
I know what you mean.
that's like this car that was in front...
of Bill Johnson's soda shop.
I was going by it and it looked green.
real green. Have you seen him lately?
I was getting my sewing machine fixed across the street...
and he was sitting in the window of his shop just staring.
that is strange.
it's your bid, Betty.
what goes on up at Lovers Lane?
what do you mean?
well, you hear these things lately
kids spending so much time up there.
is it holding hands? That kind of thing?
that and...
what?
it doesn't matter.
no. I want to know.
Well...sex.
what's sex?
you sure you want to know this?
well...
you see, Mom...
when two people really love each other very, very much...
and they want to share that...
are you OK?
it's just that...
your father would never do anything like that.
well, you know, Mom there are other ways to enjoy yourself without Dad.
sweetie, you coming to bed?
Yeah. I'm just going to take a bath first.
Oh, my goodness.
Oh, shit.
Oh, God.
fire!
cat?
OK, right here.
all right, stop.
stop!
where is it?
Whoa!
here, grab the nozzle.
but where's the cat? -Just hold on tight.
Whoa!
so that's what these things do.
in honor and in recognition of your heroism...
and with great appreciation from the citizens of Pleasantville...
I am pleased to present you with this special commendation from the Pleasantville Chamber of Commerce.
that sure was swell. -Thank you, Margaret.
I baked you some of my oatmeal cookies.
Oh, no. You baked those for Whitey.
no. I baked them for you.
no. You baked them for Whitey.
I baked them for you. -No
no. I baked them for you.
thank you.
sure.
what's going on?
I'm not sure. They want to ask you a question.
I didn't really know how to handle it.
how you doing?
you wanted to ask me something?
how'd you know about the fire?
what?
how'd you know how to put it out?
well, where I used to live, that's just what firemen did.
and where's that?
outside of Pleasantville.
what's outside of Pleasantville?
it doesn't matter. It's not important.
what's outside of Pleasantville?
there are some places that the road doesn't go in a circle.
there are some places where the road keeps going.
keeps going?
Yeah, it just keeps going.
it all keeps going. Roads and rivers.
like the mighty Mississippi?
what?
I thought the books were blank.
they were.
this was not my fault.
when they asked me what it was about...
I didn't remember because I read it back in tenth grade.
when I told them what I did remember...
that's when the pages filled in.
the pages filled in?
but only up until the part with the raft...
cause that's as far as I read.
do you know how it ends?
Yeah, I do. -So how does it end?
well, OK.
let's see, they were running away
huck and the slave.
they were going up the river, trying to get free.
and, in trying to get free...
they see that they're sort of free already.
Oh, my God.
what about this one?
Oh, yeah. This is great.
this kid Holden Caulfield. He's a really lonely kid.
he gets kicked out of boarding school.
look at 'em.
it's spreadin' all over the place.
look at her books.
look at her sweater.
going up to that lake all the time is one thing...
but now they're going to a library?
what's next?
you're right.
somebody ought to do something about that.
soon.
you're probably wondering why I asked to stop by and see you today.
I'm sure you've noticed the same things we all have.
certain changes in the town.
you know what I mean by changes?
changes.
and I'm not just talking about big stuff like the fire.
it's the little things. Did you hear about Bill Miller?
no. What?
wife wants him to get one of those new beds.
one of those big beds?
Oh, my gosh. What's he gonna do?
I don't know. It's everywhere.
bill Anderson's boy just quit his job at the market.
quit?
just took his apron off right in the middle of an order said, "l don't feel like it anymore."
groceries all over the counter.
took them three hours just to sort it out.
everybody really likes you, George.
well... -No, they do.
not just 'cause you're a good bowler. People respect you.
well, thank you.
it's important for them to see someone they respect stand up for what's right.
if you love a place, you can't just sit back...
and watch this kind of thing happen, can you?
no, of course not.
that is why I want you to be a member of the Pleasantville Chamber of Commerce.
Oh, my gosh.
I hardly know what to say.
it's just like yours.
it is exactly like mine, George.
you can start by saying yes.
Betty, Bob wants to try...
I'll get her.
are you OK?
you all right?
what am I going to do?
I can't go out there this way.
how can I go out there this way?
look at me.
it's OK. It's all right.
have you got any makeup?
in my handbag.
honey, where are you?
here. Give me your cheek.
here. Give me the other. There.
that's good. Now lift your chin up.
ls it working? -Yes.
here, look at me.
what?
does it look OK?
Yeah. It looks just like it did.
and they won't be able to tell?
no, they won't be able to tell.
Betty, are you in there?
boy...
coming, sweetie.
aren't you a little bit early?
I brought you something from the library.
it's an art book.
Oh, my gosh, Bud.
since you liked to paint, it might help to...
gee whiz.
who is...Titian?
I'm not sure.
it's beautiful, Bud.
what's wrong?
no, it's just...
I'll never be able to do that.
well, you just started. I mean, you can't do it now.
that's not it.
just where am I gonna see colors like that?
must be awful lucky to see colors like that.
I'll bet they don't know how lucky they are.
how you doing? -Swell.
listen, you probably don't think I should be asking you this.
will you go out with me tonight?
Hey, Mr. Simpson, your lawn looks great.
well, come here, young fella.
you know, I've been thinking.
I might have been a little hasty the other day...
when you asked to come home.
it just took me by such surprise, you know?
so even though I can't make any promises...
I figured if you asked me real nice...
I might just be willing to talk about it again.
I can't. -What?
talk about it right now.
I'll be honest with you, Bud. I'm getting concerned about what I'm seeing on some of these reruns.
reruns?
like when Margaret Henderson makes her cookies for Whitey.
those are not your cookies, Bud.
I know they're not my cookies
those are Whitey's cookies, Bud. They belong to him.
then he eats them and asks her to go to Lovers Lane
I would love to talk about all this right now...
but I am really in a hurry. I can't hear you!
it's really cruddy reception! We'll talk later!
what's wrong?
listen...
you're reading.
I can't believe you started such a dorky fad.
it's D. H Lawrence.
you ever heard of him?
Yeah, I read a couple of pages. Seemed kind of sexy.
it is.
can I ask you a question?
sure.
how come I'm still in black and white?
what?
I've had 10 times as much sex as the rest of these girls, and I still look like this.
I mean, they spend like an hour in the back seat of some car...
and all of a sudden, they're in Technicolor?
I don't know. Maybe it's not just the sex.
where is it?
a little bit farther, I think.
WKPV, the sounds of Pleasantville.
here's a new one for all you kids out at Lovers Lane.
Wow.
it's amazing, huh?
we're closed right now.
Oh, I'm sorry. I...
Hi. I just thought that
no. Come on in.
it's beautiful.
Thanks.
I was just trying to do one of these still lifes.
kind of having a tough time.
I think it looks nice.
well, here's what it's supposed to look like.
Oh, my god.
here. Look at this.
where did you get this? -Bud brought it to me.
my Bud? -Yeah. Here's my favorite.
what do you think?
isn't it great how she's resting like that?
she's crying.
no, she's not.
Yes, she is.
wait. -No. I've got to go.
it's all right. Let me see.
it's beautiful.
it's beautiful.
you shouldn't cover that up.
here. Let me just...
so what's it like?
what? -Out there.
well, it's...
it's louder, and...
scarier, I guess.
and it's a lot more dangerous.
sounds fantastic.
the other night, some kids came up to go swimming...
and they took off all their clothes.
do you want some berries?
some berries. I picked them myself.
Really?
Yeah, there's lots of stuff.
like what?
here, I'll show you.
here.
go ahead. Try it.
what are you doing?
it's 6: 30.
so?
we were gonna...
you know.
Oh, I can't.
why not? -I'm busy.
with what? -I'm studying.
good evening.
good evening.
evening.
George. -Good evening, Norm.
honey, I'm home.
honey, I'm home.
what was that? -I don't know.
what is that?
what's going on?
it's rain.
real rain?
you don't have rain either?
well, of course you don't. It's OK.
here, come on.
what's going on?
it's rain.
it's OK. It's fine.
there's nothing to be scared of.
here, I'll show you.
it's just rain. It's OK.
it's fine. Come on out.
you see? Look!
you see?
come on! Come on!
it's cold.
cool.
honey, I'm home.
Where's my dinner?
Where's my dinner?
Where's my dinner?
what happened?
are you all right?
what is it?
rain.
real rain?
Oh, my God.
are you all right?
I came home like I always do...
and I went in the front door...
and I took off my coat...
and I put down my briefcase...
and I said, "Honey, I'm home."
only there was no one there.
no wife.
no lights.
no dinner. -No dinner?
I went to the oven.
I thought maybe she had made me one of those TV dinners.
Yeah, sure.
she hadn't.
she was gone.
I looked and looked and looked.
she was gone.
it's gonna be fine, George.
you're with us now.
what are we gonna do, Bob?
well, we're safe for now.
thank goodness we're in a bowling alley.
but if George here doesn't get his dinner...
any one of us could be next.
it could be you, Gus.
or you, Roy.
or even you, Ralph.
that is real rain out there, gentlemen.
this isn't some little virus that'll clear up on its own.
something is happening to our town.
and I think we can all see where it's coming from.
why don't you show them what you showed me before?
it's OK, Roy. Come on up here.
I know, Roy.
Thanks.
he asked her what she was doing.
she said nothing. She was just thinking.
my friends, this isn't about George's dinner.
it's not about Roy's shirt.
it's a question of values.
it's a question of whether...
we want to hold on to those values that made this place great.
so a time has come to make a decision.
are we in this thing alone or are we in it together?
together.
I told you where I was. -All night?
I got caught in the storm. You were gone all night, too.
listen...
let's just forget about it. We'll just go to the meeting.
no. I told you, George, I'm not going to that meeting.
sure you are. -No, I'm not.
look at me, George.
look at my face. That meeting's not for me.
you'll put on some makeup.
I don't want to put on some makeup.
it goes away. It'll go away.
I don't want it to go away.
now, you listen to me.
you're coming to this meeting.
you're going to put on some makeup.
you're going to be home at 6: 00 every night...
and you're going to have dinner ready on this table.
no, I'm not, sweetie.
I made you a meat loaf.
put it in the oven and turn this little knob up to 350.
if you put the pie in 40 minutes later...
it'll be hot in time for dessert.
I made a couple of lunches for you for tomorrow...
and put them in brown paper bags.
I'm going to go now.
where are you gonna go?
I'm going to go now.
don't go out there like that. They'll see you.
they'll see you.
Betty, come back here!
it's beautiful. Can I open it?
sure.
Where'd you get it?
it was a prop from the school play.
thank you.
whitey.
Hey, Bud, why aren't you at the town meeting right now?
no reason. How come you're not?
we're supposed to go around and let everyone know about it.
I thought maybe it was because you were too busy...
entertaining your colored girlfriend.
why don't you guys get the hell out of here?
all right. We'll do that.
Margaret, you can come over and make those oatmeal cookies for me anytime you want to.
people.
people!
Roy Campbell's got a blue front door.
it's always been blue. -People.
people, please.
please.
I think we all know what's been going on here.
up until now...
everything around here has always been, well, pleasant.
recently, certain things have become unpleasant.
now, it seems to me...
that the first thing we have to do...
is to separate out the things that are pleasant...
from the things that are unpleasant.
that's Betty Parker, isn't it?
that is an outrage.
what the hell do you think you're doing?
get in here. Now!
you think this is a toy?
you think it's your own little goddamn coloring book?
it just sort of happened.
a deluge doesn't just happen.
bolts of lightning don't just happen.
I didn't do anything wrong.
Oh, no? Let me show you something.
go on, try it.
boom! Right there! What do you call that?
you don't deserve this place.
you don't deserve to live in this paradise.
Where's the remote control I gave you?
Why?
because you're coming home, you little twerp...
and I'm gonna put this place back the way it was.
I can't let you do that.
I'm sorry. I'm not gonna let you do that.
just give me the damn remote!
I'm gonna go now.
you're not going anywhere.
you're gonna get that remote and come home...
and we're gonna make everybody happy again.
where you going in such a hurry?
that's not real friendly.
let's see if she looks like her picture.
you want to be friendly, don't you?
why don't you show us what's under that nice blue dress?
Yeah, come on!
where you going? There's nowhere to go.
that is a lovely shade of blue.
don't you think that's a lovely shade of blue?
get out of here!
go on! Get out of here!
are you OK?
what?
it's OK. He's not in there.
it's OK. All right?
I'm gonna get you out of here, all right?
are you OK?
keep them coming!
no, Mary Sue, it's better this way.
this is the only book I've ever read in my whole life...
and you're not gonna put it on that fire!
just give me the book!
it's me.
let's go inside.
just thought I'd try to tidy it up a bit.
it's OK. It's OK.
once we sweep it up, it'll be all right again.
he's right. Let's...
help me with this, will you?
sure.
good. Put this up in here.
people!
people!
this is not the answer, people.
no matter how upset we may get...
or how frustrated we may be...
we're not gonna solve our problems out in the street.
it's just the wrong way to do it.
we have to find a code of conduct that we can all agree to live by.
I asked George and Ralph here to sketch out a few ideas...
and I think they've done a terrific job.
if we can all agree to these, we can take a vote...
and I think we can start off in the right direction.
One--all public disruption and acts of vandalism...
are to cease immediately.
Two--all citizens of Pleasantville...
are to treat each other...
in a courteous and pleasant manner.
courteous and pleasant manner." That's not too bad.
three--the area commonly known as Lovers Lane...
as well as the Pleasantville public library...
shall be closed until further notice.
Four--the only permissible recorded music...
shall be the following:
Johnny Mathis, Perry Como, Jack Jones...
the marches of John Philip Sousa...
or The Star-Spangled Banner.
ln no event shall any music be tolerated...
that is not of a temperate or pleasant nature.
Five--there shall be no public sale of umbrellas...
or preparation for inclement weather of any kind.
Six--no bed frame or mattress may be sold...
measuring more than 38 inches wide.
seven--the only permissible paint colors...
shall be black, white, or gray...
despite the recent availability of certain alternatives.
Eight--all elementary and high school curriculum...
shall teach the non-changeist view of history...
emphasizing continuity over alteration.
Wow.
hey...
this thing still works.
turn that off!
you're not allowed to do that now!
sure you are.
wow, this is good.
you just do it?
don't worry. We'll get you a new one.
I don't know what I'd do if I couldn't paint anymore.
maybe I have an idea.
shameless.
when are they gonna let them out?
Hey, what are you kids doing out there?
there's someone to see you, Bud.
is this a bad time?
no, it's fine. Come on in.
I brought you something.
thank you.
cocktail olives. -Everything else was frozen.
I didn't know how to
I appreciate it.
your mom went out. -Went out?
Yeah. She went out for a little while.
when?
three days ago.
jeez, everything is so cockeyed.
I didn't even know it was Tuesday.
tuesday we play bridge with the Jenkins.
there was no bridge. It's
can I have one of those?
sure. Yeah. You hungry?
Mrs. Benson was making meat loaf next door.
I almost climbed in her kitchen window.
what happened? One minute, everything's fine.
the next...
what went wrong?
nothing went wrong. People change.
people change?
Yeah, people change.
can they change back?
I don't know. I think it's harder.
you OK?
Yeah. Not fair, you know?
you get used to one thing and
I know. It's not.
bud Parker, William Johnson...
you are charged with desecration of a public building...
and with the intentional use of prohibited paint colors...
in violation of the Pleasantville code of conduct...
and laws of common decency.
do you admit that on the night of May 1st...
you did willfully and consciously apply...
the following forbidden paint colors...
to the north wall of the Pleasantville police station...
red, pink, vermilion, puce, chartreuse...
umber, blue, aqua, oxblood, green, peach, crimson...
yellow, olive, and magenta?
Yeah, I do. Where's our lawyer?
I think we want to keep these proceedings...
as pleasant as possible.
I don't think a lawyer will be necessary.
do you further admit that this unnatural depiction...
occurred in full public view where it was accessible to...
and in plain sight of minor children?
it was accessible to everyone.
let the record show that the defendants have answered...
in the affirmative to all charges.
do you have anything to say in your defense?
Yeah, I do
I didn't mean to hurt anybody.
maybe if I painted something different.
or maybe I could use less colors or something.
or, you know, certain colors. Or maybe I could
you could pick out the colors beforehand...
and then they wouldn't bother anybody.
I've got something to say. -Very well.
you don't have a right to do this.
I mean...
I know you want it to stay pleasant around here...
but there are so many things...
that are so much better.
like silly or sexy...
or dangerous or brief.
and every one of those things is in you all the time...
if you just have the guts to look for them.
that's enough.
I thought I was allowed to defend myself.
you're not allowed to lie. -I'm not lying.
you see those faces up there? They're no different than you.
they just see something inside themselves
I said that's enough.
I'll show you. Dad?
Yeah, Bud?
it's OK, Dad. Just listen for a sec.
I know you miss her.
I mean, you told me you did...
but maybe it's not just the cooking or the cleaning...
that you miss.
maybe it's something else.
maybe you can't even describe it.
maybe you only know it when it's gone.
maybe it's like there's a whole piece of you...
that's missing, too.
look at her, Dad.
doesn't she look pretty like that?
doesn't she look just as beautiful...
as the first time you met her?
you really want her back the way she was?
doesn't she look wonderful?
now, don't you wish you could tell her that?
you're out of order.
why am I out of order?
I'm not gonna let you turn this courtroom into a circus.
I don't think it's a circus. I don't think they do, either.
this behavior must stop at once.
that's just the point.
it can't stop at once because it's in you...
and you can't stop something inside you.
it is not inside me.
sure it is. -No, it is not.
what do you want to do to me right now?
come on. Everyone is turning colors.
kids are making out in the street.
no one is getting their dinner. Hell, you could have a flood.
pretty soon, the women could be going off to work...
while the men stayed at home and cooked.
that is not going to happen. -But it could!
no, it could not!
Hey, look at this!
what an image.
shut up.
you sure you don't want to come home?
Yeah. I gotta do this for a little while.
besides, you think I even have a chance...
of getting into college back there?
honestly?
got your admissions letter? -Right here.
I did the slut thing, David.
got kinda old.
I'll come back and check on you soon.
you turned into a pretty cool guy.
how'd that happen?
I don't know.
I'll see you.
just don't forget about me.
even if you never come back.
I just don't want you to forget about me.
I couldn't do that.
here. -What's this?
lots of stuff. A meat loaf sandwich...
and a hard-boiled egg...
and some marshmallow rice squares.
there's some fried chicken in there, too.
don't skip dinner just 'cause you're not here anymore.
I won't. I thought you weren't
I had to come say good-bye.
just wear this on the trip...
in case it gets cold.
it's a pretty short trip.
still...
I am just so proud of you.
Thanks.
I know.
I love you, too.
well...
well...
I guess you better stand back.
that concludes the first hour of the pleasantville marathon.
don't forget...
we'll be going all night long until noon tomorrow
I thought you went out of town.
came back.
what's wrong?
I don't know. Everything's so fucked up.
I got halfway down there and thought, "What am I doing?"
he's nine years younger than I am.
doesn't make me feel younger. Makes me feel older.
when your father was here, I used to think this was it.
this was the way it was always going to be.
I had the right house, the right car...
the right life
there is no right house, there is no right car.
God, my face must be a mess.
it looks great.
that's really sweet, but I'm sure it does not look great.
sure, it does.
come here.
I'm 40. It's not supposed to be like this.
it's not supposed to be anything.
hold still.
how'd you get so smart all of a sudden?
I had a good day.
so what's gonna happen now?
I don't know.
do you know what's going to happen now?
no. I don't.
I guess I don't, either.
when did you get here?
I flew this morning
I see.
I haven't seen you long time
talk to you later.
what's your problem? Huh?
this is my seat?
where that comes from? Seat wherever you want.
wherever? This is my seat for a long time.
don't embarrass me in front of these country boys.
you seat there. I am embarrassed, too.
don't make my life hard. Darn you.

to make this short, I ask you to gather to announce my retirement
I appreciate your support.
from now on, Buykdol and Gaedduk will take care of my family
okay, the rule of the game is man to man
this is one on one death match.

Sambok stay close behind me.
Gaedduk. Cut yourself with that!

so, this is all Cho Dongpal's trap, right?
I am sorry.
let say Dongpal did all this, what should I do with Sambok?
he drove me crazy. Should I kill him?
old saying "In trust is treason."
so Sambok made a false statement that you stab him, right?
that's okay, I thank that one of us is not here.
I don't believe there is a hood among mobsters.
you speak as if you're not one of us?
Sambok, what I should do! Hoodless brat.
son of bitch

son of dog!
you don't seem to have any hood, either.
you two come here and kneel down.
report yourself, hurry!
what, report myself?

that's me.

from today until the days of revenge.
I shall wait patiently.
same to me!
what are you looking at? Get off!
my brother!
what?
bastard, You made bad choice.
I picked you up from Seoul station, you were nothing but a shoe cleaner with handsome face.
I made you mobster, ain't I?
Yes, you did.
and you betrayed us in such a decisive moment.
you are not one of us.
even though you know how to sneak out, you just turned your Bro.
down and frame him? You...
that's not true.
I told them that I didn't know who stab me.
lawyer told us that!
for my life, I swear that's not true.
how could you trust lawyers?
you don't know a thing.
what, you bastard!
if I were caught, who could look after you two?
what the heck!
you're saying it as if you did it!
stop it, we had anonymous food, and that's what he did.
that's what you were saying looking after us?
you Shameless brat.
why didn't you write us then?
you can't read.
who told you that? Buykdol did?
everyone know you can't read.
I just can't write, but I can read.
please stop it, he had enough.
you wouldn't guess how I've been doing.
without you two, I was nothing.
what do I have?
even Karaoke bouncers mocked me.
do you understand the one who can't come to see you?
these little bastard treated me as if I am an old man.
I had nowhere to go.
and I can't join Cho Dongpal.
at least, meals are served in the prison.
that's it!
what is that you are holding?
this is Pochen tofu.
it's organic, not cheap one.
what?
it's made by hand. Go on, Try it!
let's have bite!
let's cheers!
Cheers!
okay!
he owns 12 bars over, and 13 casinos.
however, his most expensive property is
Hankok Building.

I just wonder what is going on.

excuse me~
well! I'm sorry but can you delay one more day?
what do you mean?
can you delay one more day to arrest him?
why is that?
once we're done, we will take him to police station.
what the heck are you talking about?
I'm sure you will beat him at the police station, why don't you allow us to do that for you?
it will make your life much easier.
are you out of your mind?
he owes me a lot. He needs to get pay-back.
he is pissed off, and he has short temper.
if you have something to say, then follow us to the station.
that's okay. No thanks.
take care, sir!
Darm.
that bastard.
should we let him go just like that? I'm going nut!
calm down! You, you say something!
calm down as you said. There must be the way.
I have a letter from Yasu.

I just couldn't wait to see it,
I will take over your realty at Kangnam,
and I will also take Eunji, I just write to let you know,
from Yasu, what should I put for "Relationship"?
are we related? I'm not a faggot.
it's not you had sex with him.
just put who we are, friend or parent?
relationship is a "Foe."
you come right over here! You bastard!
I will kill you. Kill you.
what the...
why are you hitting window?
are you gonna pay for it, if it brakes?
you darm...
wait just a second.
I will just blow a police station and join you there.
calm down.
you promise me that I will take care all this.
I am sorry. My Bro.
you requested to see us.
Yes, so I can apologize to you all.
I've written in blood for 15 years to kill you
apology would not be accepted.
it would not be enough to just kill you.
please give me one more chance.
are you mocking us again?
I should kill you now. - Calm down!
you promised me that let me take care all this.
so what is the reason to see us?
who are you? Are you a gangster?
you are nothing but a street rat.
none of your cheek
please accept my apology.
I wouldn't wanna bargain your interest with money.
I really would like to apologize. I would like to provide you 5 billion won.
what?
it's my duty to provide you whatever you need.
to say this would not satisfy you but, I bought some realty in Kangnam for you.
why don't you sell that and make some money for the rest of your life?
I'm sure I understand you, so please forgive me and my fault.
from now, I take care of you
and, I believe you don't have nowhere to go.
until I release, please stay at my home.
I will be out soon.
5 billion won is big money, but money doesn't matter to us.
we can't trust you.
we will wait until you are released.
where should we wait for him?
don't you dare to mock us again!
please go and see my lawyer then you will understand.
trust me. Bros.
so he wants to pay us 5 billion won to bargain our forgiveness.
shut up! Don't forget who we are.
once upon a time we ruled Jongro and...
wait... I forgot... who was it?
fat and...
there are many fat men.
the one who was in Film knows how to fight.
kim Doohan?
Oh! Yes! That's right!
wait a sec.
why am I talking about Kim Doohan?
I have such a short memory.
no twenty questions, it droves me crazy.
GaeDduk is right.
we are the descendant of Kim Doohan.
what? Descendant? That's right!
but wait, what is descendant?
that's enough!
from now on, what are we gonna do for living?
I predicted it and hid a pot of money.
what? - What is buried?
a pot of money!
Really? Where?
so once there were all mountain?
it has been changed since then, right?
so you are sure you buried that here?
Yes!
it's five steps away from the glans.
what is the glans?
a bat!
this is it! - What?
are you sure?
just dig up, hurry.
what?
Buykdol, have you heard "Hwajo"?
Hwajo"? I've never heard.
why did he put his name where you buried your money?
Whajo? What is the last name?
Cheung!
cheung Whajo?
what?
Darm.
let's get sweat! - What is this smell?
excuse me.
so was that a pot of money or a pot of shit?
one famous general said treat money as shit.
where did that come from?
do you have 10, 000won?
no I don't
if you do, I will kick your ass.
no I don't, really! Check me.
how could he hide money on his naked body?
don't be silly and just come right over here.
would I take money from you?
if you don't have money,
I was about to give you my money.
you shouldn't misunderstand this.
Yes. - Now go.
why did you try to take money from little kid and kick his ass?
so what if he had some money, would you kick his ass like rats on the street?
you could kill him.
however, don't you think you are kinda too old for that?
why don't we just take 5 billion won?
and live like king!
all we need is the proof of transfer realty from his lawyer.
old people like you, sleep on the concrete street! You would be paralyzed.
you mouth would be twisted and sexually disable.
that's it! I will do it alone. - Is he really going?
of course.
why don't you stop him?
united, we stand; divided, we fall.
why are you so late?
this is the last.
stop messing around and just change it.
what do you mean?
yours is bigger than mine.
what the...! Take it and be well. Eat it!
where are you heading?

wait a sec! - What is it this time?
put your hand off it.

we're not doing this for money, but for our hood.
that's right!
I understand.
well! GaeDduk asked me to mention something to you, so I ask you
as you know GaeDduk's temper.
his justice comes from his fist, not from law.
if you betray us one more time,
Eunji will be punished first not you.
do you understand?
I see. I promise you, GaeDduk bro.
if I brake my word, you do whatever you want!
well! How time flies!
I knew she's gonna be a good singer when she sang zoo song.

you're drunken.
we should share if we get that money.
I wish to use it good way. Okay?
I heard enough.
I also wish to do good thing with money.
today, we're going to review what we've been practicing.
today, we review 2 among 12.
that's called, "Fork the eyes"
grab it.
fork the eyes
fork the eyes
all right then, as we've been practicing, stretch your fingers and fork the eyes before block it.

fork the eyes
it would hurt you badly. But what can you do?
you have to bear with it. Right?
okay, next move...
this method is for girls who been bullied by boys.
ready!
grab it
that's it. It would hurt.
they can't tell no one because it is so shameful.
beat the shit out of them, and that all they can do.
so why do you wanna teach them how to fight?
so they can't be bullied.
act like your age. How old do you think you are?
please grow up.
how can we differentiate ourselves from animal?
we, mobsters, should do something better for others, and also for us.
what?
how could we help others?
don't think too much.
all we can do for others is that we don't harm others.
what would you do with that money?
me? I wanna go to the States.
going abroad is good.
I would like go see my daughter, Soon Young, as a father.
where are you going?
I just wanna take a walk.
we have to work tomorrow, so stop drinking!
well! Darn you, you surely act like a leader.
come after this car.
let's get going.
that's Eunji.
Eunji. That's her!
hurry, come over here!
I think that is our job to clear the way.
let's get off.
get out.
make a way! Let me go through!
I was almost killed.
did you know some girls join gangs?
what gang? It's so call fan club.
fan? What is it?
English.
are you ignoring me? Darn... who knows it's in English?
where are you going?

are you kidding? Get out, now!
wait a sec.
I will just peep him through the door. Okay?
you can't see him here. Out, now!
how do you youngster have no respect for elders?
I'll not see then. That's fine. I'll not see.
what?
as we've been discussing, a problem with modern Korea society more poor than as you see around, and that is serious problem.
then, now
let's hear from the audience.
go on.
it's time for lame elders to step back.
if water does not flow, it would get rotten. We have to scoop it out.
where are you going?
you - Where is GaeDduk?
I think we have some opposite opinion.
go on.
eh! Our society is divided into two group, conservative and innovative group. Their conflict is becoming a big issue.
how do you think about it?
I don't know what you're talking about.
elder like me should all go out and die. Is that what you want?
if you would be a leader for a long time, there is always new comer who wants to take your place over.
I understand it, but don't you respect your elders?
you have to respect them. And that makes sense, right?
what have you done to us?
haven't we done anything to you?
we've been through everything until today, so you can settle down without much problem
I think you should thank us.
why do you shout?
shout? Whatever? I'm busy.
don't talk to me.
all our past should be cleared.
past, whatever! Don't confuse me, okay?
how dare you speak like that!
why do you keep yelling at me?
what? Do I have get permission to yell?
you darn... Little kid.

run for your life!
run?
hurry.
run, now! Hurry!

I don't know who Cho Eunji is,
get out, make a way!
reveal the truth, Mr, Cho Dongpal!
are you related?
where are you going?
I wanna take a walk.
let me go with you.
leave me alone!
I can't. It's not a good time go around by yourself.
don't follow me.
if you do, our contract is over.
Myung Suk!
why didn't you call me all day?
how do you find me here?
I used "Finding friends" service.
did something happen to you?
what's up?
Myung Suk, we should not see anymore.
well!
I've though just the same thing.
I am sick and tired of seeing each other like this.
why don't we get married?
then we don't have to see each other without how others see us.
I would like to see you when I wake up in the morning.
that's not what I am saying.
what's this?
why can we go around like others?
did we do something wrong?
I am really tired. What is this?
Eunji and Myung Suk will get married.
what the heck are they doing at night?
don't they ever respect elders?
love is beautiful and also sad.
where you get it?
I finally got a scoop.
you!
you come right over here!
what? I'm a reporter.
so what? Why did you take photo?
if you come over one's privacy, you could get hurt.
I am sorry. I really apologize for this incident.
they are too old, and they must be gone out of their mind.
well! As I see his hair, I think they are not okay.
Yes. That's right.
I won't let them walk around again.
why did you beat reporter?
do you know how much money I pay to reach an agreement?
well! Byukdol did it.
I told you I stopped him all the way through.
you weren't there because you slept.
that's right! I wasn't there.
how irritate!
I am annoyed, I can imagine how you would be annoyed!
I believe you couldn't get a sleep, go on.
take a break.
I will take care them.
you don't even deserve to say a thing.
what did you do at the show?
do you think Studio is your playground?
how could you not know that much?
I'm out for an appointment.
it will be re-aired. Watch it and figure out what you have done wrong for yourself.
Sambok, get up! Get up, now!
get up!
what... Why?
I told I will be on TV at 11 o'clock. You don't care do you?
you're no bro. Of mine.
what are you doing? Come on!
wait a seconde
you... I will be on TV. Darn... You're no bro. Of mine.
are you really going to be on TV?
who the heck do you think I am?
I saw Kim Heungkuk today at the studio.
Really?
Yes, yes, I saw him.
how could I miss him?
I saw him because I was on TV, man.
I should go with you.
he looks better than he really is.
he got mustache on his face and was walking toward the office.
he got an office?
of course. He is national soccer player, and he deserves it.
who? Kim Heungkuk?
Yes, that's right?
didn't you see him playing at World Cup Soccer?
kim Heungkuk ain't no soccer player.
he was a cheer leader.
are you out of your mind?
do you have any idea who he is?
he doesn't know a thing.
what? Kim Heungkuk is a singer who sang "Horangnavi." Right?
what? What? That's right. I must be gone out of my mind.
I am on now.
that one doesn't know how to respect elders.
I would kick his ass if no one else was there.
he is a son of dog.
Oh! You are welcome here! Come in.
I am about to be on TV.
we can't do much here.
TAKE'EM out!
kneel down.
what?
kneel down.
beat the shit out of them.
how couldn't you beat these old men?
you losers. Go, now.
get out! Damm how could I work with ya all!
are you okay?
how could I work with you all?
go losers. Out!
how about Eunji?
go on!
you will be jailed about 5 years for burglary and bodily harm.
you could get out of jail if you are lucky.
maybe a year early...
if you have more question, feel free to contact me.
and it's free.
are you a lawyer?
I ain't, but I know little.
what have I done nothing wrong to live like this?
it's all because of him.
Eunji. Stop it!
what are you? I don't need your help. Get out!
Eunji. Calm down!
why does this happen to me? Why?
Eunji. - Out!
out, now. I don't wanna see your face.
I am shame to be a daughter of that man.
without him, how could you be here?
I have a daughter just like you.
she is about 5 to 6 years older than you are.
I saw her lastly when I was in the prison.
soon Young.
I am sorry.
I haven't done much to you.
don't be.
I never thought of you as my father.
well!
I am married.
he is American.
he treats me very well.
I will go to the States with him.
so, from now on
don't look for me.
then,
just live as if I never existed.
I just came here to say that.
I haven't done much to her.
all I knew was how to fight.
that's all
so I'm always sorry for what I have done to her.
Fogive me
I should march with her at her wedding.
when I see you you remind me my daughter.
how badly she survived because of me.
how much would I hurt her?
don't hate your father.
can you even beat those old fas?
go to hell. What? Block it? Bastard.
bastard! You block it, too? Get up? Darn. Bastard.
go to hell, bastard.
five of us were arrested, so it's gonna settle down.
don't look down on them.
send me some good fighters who can deal tools well.
Hello, yes?
Eunji's boyfriend thought I was her father.
he wants me to see his father. What should I do?
just go see his dad, why do you worry?
do you want me to do it for you?
what? Are you kidding me?
Eunji lied that her father is in high position work at bank.
what's the matter?
be polite and speak some English. That's gonna work.
bring her here!
do you think she will listen to us?
come little bit closer, softly kiss me
feel me
feel me, Feel me, Shake your body,
we become one, One.
when long nite pass, and new days comes,
our secret word will be ended,
but we are here together,
we would share everything,
that really gives me a headache.

can you wait a sec?
Mr. Kim, can you take them out?
I can't practice because they are so funny.
can you go out and garb a cup of coffee?
it's gonna take a while for her to finish practice.
that's okay! I'm fine.
I'm not bored. Never been bored.
what? Well!
rock
paper

Darn. This...

I'll let you go this time.

just do it! Rock, scissor and paper.
I win. I win.
how childish!
stop it, now.
how could you hit me with your fist?
why don't you do it then?
Hurry!

what did you say?
I wasn't talking to you. Let's do it!

may I sit?
what?
Hey, you?
let me make it short.
can you help us to make our life easy?
what can we do?
just hand us Eunji.
it's simple as it is.
what? So you are the one who send people and try to harm us, right?
wait. Hold a second.
you darn.
that's how you ask a favor?
Yes.
and I say "No.
calm down.
I wouldn't be so rush.
think carefully and let me know.
there is no need to think about this.
it will never happen.
alright then.
that's how it ends.
I wouldn't stop threatening you.
what the heck is he talking about?
should we let him go like that?
leave him. He said he wouldn't stop to threaten us.
that was a threat. So he just tested us until now?
what should we do now?
should we speak to Dongpal who still is in prison?
that's not the problem.
we have to get rid of these old fas first.
your daughter is much prettier than how she shows on TV.
I really appreciate your compliment.
I would like to introduce myself. My name is Kwon Myung Suk.
Oh, I see. You are just like what I heard. How handsome!
so you are working for bank?
Yes, I do.
I heard working at bank isn't easy.
I'm not a teller. I am working at the headquarter in Jongro.
Really?
Oh! That's great!
wonderful.
well! That's nothing.
you two look great each other.
I believe you have a great sex life, right?
that's joke.
what are you doing?
come, follow me.

if you hit me again, I'm gonna sue you.
who's gonna hit whom? I won't hit anybody.
take film out. Now.
okay.

I wish for the best of our family.
Yes, same to you.
I will see you soon.
okay! Take great care of you two.
that's enough.
Eunji
get out! Make a way!
get out!
get away!
OK, begin!
come on!
Dammit...
see, look at his hair, how funny!
wanna die?
darn, you don't even know Ronaldo.
begin.
be quiet! Shut up!
whoever comes up the stage and do something strange.
I will peel your skin. That wouldn't be so funny.
why are you all laughing?
do you understand what I'm saying?
these little bastard.
why is he on the stage?
he really drives me crazy.
are you gonna ignore me like that?
why do you keep laughing?
bring him down form the stage.
hurry, now!
you are all crazy. I'll go nut.
do you really wanna fight with me?
why are you up here?
hold, hold. I'm here to warn them.
warning? You are? To them? Now? Why?
let me go.
what are you doing up there, now?
these bastard have no respect.
that's fine. You don't have to do anything.
just do nothing, but stand still.
we want "show.
Eunji.
come closer and kiss me,
feel me, Feel it, Feel it
shake your body,
shake your body cool, Now we are "one," One
did you do that intentionally?
I have been waited. I swear a god, no never.
all you know is how to throw rock and fight?

I'm about to get out,
I would wear Prettier than anybody put on sexy make-up
I am about to become gorgeous hero
tonite, deep yourself into seduction,
fill heat in your eyes, feel me hot, wet feel me,
what are you doing?
what is this?
where is Eunji?
so that news was right.
I didn't intend to lie. I am sorry.
hello. Yeah?
is Eunji alright? What?
this is Byukdol.
I don't care whoever you are, let me make it short.
I see. I will be there by then.
Gaedduk, we have lived long enough.
I think it is time for us.
Sambok, let split here.
I thank you for what you have done to us.
you did great things, mobster wannabe!
that's right. You better be out.
that's really disappointing.
you ignore me because I can't fight, right?
that's not what I mean.
we just can't fight when you are with us.
I am sorry about it.
but I am as old as you are.
I don't wanna leave you for my good.
let me go with you.
no, you can't. That's for Eunji.
Sambok, you must go?
you could kill yourself.
don't you ever listen to us?
Darn. I can't do anything to Dongpal.
do it when you see him in hell.
what if we go heaven, and he goes to hell.
are you crazy?
what makes you think we could go heaven?
anyways, there is no revenge then.
even though it was short time, but we were with Eunji.
I think we did something good for someone, and I'm happy about that.
we'll fight as father, not as mobster.
Eunji, where are you?
how could man do something to little girl?
the natural outcome of one's acts." You should know what that meant.
just shut up and bring her here.
that I can't.
you should pay us for what we have done for you.
you should know how to suit yourself.
no more words, I will die as a man.
how childish!
so there is no more negotiation, right?
well then! My patient is about to wear out.
good luck!
Sambok, don't fall asleep. Hang in there.
Sambok!
how are you?
I am fine. I just need good rest.
how come did you save a little brat like me?
that's your father's favor.
we owe you father a lot.
it's time to payback.
don't hate your father.
so you were kidnapped by mobster?
she's not well.
can you please excuse us?
so are you related to Cho Dongpal?
he already said he was not related.
didn't you know? Get out, now.
Yes, that is true.
Eunji?
Cho Dongpal is my father.
it's a scandal. It can ruin your career.
how does your father think about this incident?
there aren't much to say, make a way!
noting to say
make a way
I really appreciate what you have done to me.
do you really have to go abroad?
I just wanna take a break where I am nobody and also want to study.
I will miss you.
can we come to the airport with you?
don't come.
I couldn't be separated if you come to the airport.
I will go now.
where is Eunji?
Mr. Kim, where is Eunji?
she just left.
sir. I need your help. Please help me.
what?
I've lived twice.
okay. I see.
Really?
ladies and gentlemen,
I would like to apologize for interruption,
there is a message from Seoul,
to a lover who is about to leave,
this is his sorrowful message,
Eunji, I'm sorry, I couldn't protect you,
I don't mind wherever you go, and even you don't call me,
however, I want you to promise me to come back,
I'll wait until you're back,
I love you,
I just look.
it's okay! Take pictures as many as you want.
thank you. - You know what's gonna happen if pictures do not come right?
thankyou for calling
sorry I can't answeryour call now
please leave a message
I'll call back as soon as possible
Hello...Are you at home?
I'll come and clean your house today!
I'll arrive in a minute
Hello...Hello...
are you having a shower?
I'm on the way to your house
no problem, right?
you're not at home?
Why?
Hello? Are you alive?
you make me worried
you called me here?
what happened?
I promised to come and clean your house today
you forgot about it?
I came here to purify my soul
where are you now?
somewhere unimaginable
doing what?
pratising Saxophone in my car
I want you to purify my soul too
just now I thought you were dead
I'm so lonely. I miss you.
are you troubled?
I want to tell you something important
something important? What?
I can't tell you right now
this will make me worried
I want to marry you
I'll say it again
I want to marry you
may I think about it for a few days
Why?
that's why I wanted to discuss that with you at home
somewhere in time
water ofToyko turned to look like withered Sakura...
but I'm too indecisive
how many times have this happened?
I have to hide at my sister's house
I should be more determined!
in such an energetic city how come there's hardly any activites in the morning
when it comes to the Heisei era
baseball seems to have become more interesting
a city that has nothing to do with me
everybody seems to be a stranger
I wan tvery much to have a dream
but in fact, I can't sleep well at night
I look energetic, but am in fact exhausted
if there is a pretty woman who can make me sleep tight
a girl who can wake me up in the morning...
what? You want a pretty woman?
you want what? Why mumbling early in the morning...
don't disturb me!
overhearing others is no different from peeking at their diaries
very bad indeed!
you still can't go to sleep?
why don't you take some sleeping pills?
I can't sleep unless there is a pretty woman who can make me exhausted
you are a freak!
it's you who are a freak
already 22 years old and still a virgin
who will approach me when there is such a freak living here
you have your own house
why don't you stay there?
I have my dificulties
I have my difficulties too
I'll make a salad foryou as a compensation
I won't be happy with such minorthing
I better eat cornflakes with milk
of course I manage to do such simple thing
I don't understand you at all
sleeping is one ofthe ways that makes a woman beautiful
it is very important to woman
so don't mumble and wake me up ever again!
to a man, having a sister like you is a disaster
she is the only woman whom I can't understand
but at least she doesn't sleep around. That's good
you can wash your mouth now
I'm wet with the mouth wash
that's because I gave you a local anaesthetic so your mouth can't move at yourwill
why I'm like having a dementia?
I have a date today...
it's meaningless to kiss my boyfriend with my mouth like this!
how long will the anaesthetist last?
when will meetyour boyfriend?
at midnight
there should be no problem
the effect ofthe anaesthesia will have gone bythat time
when my mouth is painful you'll give me pain-killers, right?
in general, yes
but I don't want you to kiss your boyfriend
so it's better not to give you any pain-killers
you're bullying me!
it has been a hard time for you
go and take your pain-killers at the counter
that is? How disappointing!
take care
showing such an annoying face
he is indeed irritating
now choose the colour of your false tooth
love affair in office is not allowed
love affair in office?
women are intuitive...
that woman likes you
that woman? She is my...
your wife?
I've told you I won't get married
Yes, you can't
you're ours
which colour do you like?
which one is better?
how about No. 1
isn't it too white? The difference is too obvious, isn't it?
how troublesome you are
how about No. 4 then?
I also think No. 4 is bette
I'm like choosing a wedding ring with you
false tooth can bite squid
but a wedding ring can't even bite the finger
once I have my false tooth fixed
I can't see you any more. Is that right?
you can come to clean your teeth
can we have a date?
I know you belongs to us all
but please spare some time with me
I'm fully booked these weeks
good night
being able to fall asleep once saying 'Good night' is perhaps the most blissful thing in this world
look, here is the timer
I came to watch your show just now
of course I knew it
and my show tonight was dedicated foryou
why leave me then?
I misunderstood the meaning offreedom
I want to talk about our marriage
my marriage with you is perhaps God's will
God's will? I don't believe it
I only belive in our love
but marriage concerns not only about us but also my parents, relatives and my troublesome sister
I want to meet your sister...
let's go visit hertonight
don't be surprised when you see her
if she is prettierthan me
I may feel a little surprised then
let's meet her another day
Why? I want to have it over as soon as possible
who is it?
your brother
Ruriko, a guest is here tonight
she is my francee
fill the glass with water
don't spill it. Hold itwith both hands and sit properly
can I give up halfway?
stop complaining!
me too?
of course
I can't believe it
you can't trust him
how can you spend the rest of your life with my brother
I won't even think about it
we are not like you
you need to depend on nothing
it seems I've had a nightmare
I hope you understand that marriage concerns not only about us
it also concerns our parents and relatives
my parents are excited about it
they said their daughter-in-law must be virtuous
my relatives care about nothing but money
my sister is a bit better when compared with them
she is more superstitous than me
I want to get away from all these
that's why I paly sax
why a couple who love each other can't get married
many socical problems will arise if we concern only about ourselves
I don't care about the society
that's why I can't get married easily
it's such a difficult decision for me
I decide not to marry you
you are miserable
let's find a place and play sax
find a place and play sex?
I can't do that right now
I want to play the last song for you ...using my saxophone
the only audience is you, who are now driving away from me
I'm sorry
I misheard you
I'll take you home
women can adjust themselves according to different situations
in a suite with two bathrooms
I think of ourfirst night together
we bought a melon from the vegetable shop cut in half in the room and ate together
that was the most luxurious night...
I have ever had
that's enough
don't keep talking about the past
if I was a fan ofyours we wouldn't have ended up like this
will you continue playing saxophone
perhaps I'll become a dentist
will it be too late to start now
I'll remember it forthe rest of my life
me too
which song do you want me to play for you?
goodbye. You've made up your mind, right?
I'm no good in telling lies
separation is just a phase
good morning
your reward
well done
it's time to stop
I want to agree with you
I want a brother who'll agree with me
you have your insomnia cured?
not yet, but I don't feel tired
a strong man who never feel tired
I'm not gentle to you
but please try to be gentle to me sometimes
well...
we haven't been to a disco for long
there is a new disco in Ginza
let's go together
I'll pick you up after work
put on a beautiful dress
I'll wait for you
she can be easily cheated
good to have such a sister
let's take a rest
I've waited for long before you said this
I'll take you some food
though I say so
I don't have much expectation on the food and drink here
just don't want the table to be too empty
Really? It's troublesome to see a dentist
have to make an appointment, just like the driving school
and you can't leave halfway
I've tried cold food and drink
perhaps I have a decayed tooth
a decayed tooth will smell
Oh no, it's intolerable
I want to have it fixed
which tooth?
this one
the tooth here feels a little strange
open your mouth and let me see it
you gave me a shock, who are you?
I'm a dentist
you must be kidding
sorry to interrupt you
I overheard your conversation
conversation about your teeth
a fresh and healthy topic
are you really a dentist?
then what are the reasons for toothache?
tooth is made up of such materials as enamel ...dentine and bone
if there is an infection
pressure will build up as pus and gases are trapped
your nerves are then constricted causing pain in your tooth
when you're warm blood circulation will make you feel acute pain
well it's really painful
although I don't quite understand, it sounds like the truth
I'm a dentist
please come to my clinic when you need
this is my name card
I'm Yuka Toki. I've make an appointment at two o'clcok
is this yourfirst time here?
did you bring your insurance card?
Yes, I did
please come with me
please come and sit here
so I'm a really a dentist
I don't know yet
you can be a dentist or a quack depending on your skills
certainly, I'm not a good dentist
I'm self-willed
I do badly if I don't like that patient
but I can be good if I like her
come on, open your mouth
what?
because we met in a disco
it's betterthan knowing each other through telephone hotline
you have quite a lot of decayed teeth
how long will it take to have them fixed?
around three months
how many time I have to come each week?
once a week
only once a week?
and lasts only forthree months
I'll be lonely ifthese are dates that I have
Yes, you're right
if you're my girlfriend
I won't make you feel lonely
are you single?
yes
Oh really?
how about her?
I thought she was your girlfriend
Yes, she does have a crush on me but if we become a couple
I'll have to spend more than I earn
the x-ray ofthat patient has come out
you can't do that
this wiil cause misunderstanding among other patients
I'm taking care of several patients at a time
I have no other choice
you say nothing about this at ordinary times
I'm just carrying out my duties
it is you who are talking in whispers
mind that
you're impervious to reason
the x-ray is here
for a man who is used to ask about prices what he wants to know is not only the price ofthis painting but also the value of the women he comes across
I don't want to be a man ofthis kind
sorry to have kept you waitng
my boss thought I would be out for long
how's work? Interesting?
very much interesting... so many weird people came around
last time a strange dentist came
he talked about nothing but teeth
because I'm a dentist
I said I wasn't going because it was too far away
he asked me to come by taxi and he'd pay for it
it's the first time I came across such thing
anyway, I think someone else will be willing to go
I didn't accept his invitation in the end
such kind of people coming to the art gallery?
not here
I worked in Ginza after finishing my job here
I met him there
you feel uncomfortable to say you work in a night club?
it's nearly dark
it'll look more like Ginza from now on
will you come?
not tonight...I'm sorry
you have a date?
in orderto start a relationship with you
I'll go and dump my girlfriend now
Really?
just kidding
I feel lonely at this moment
you performance was marvellous
I hope a pretty woman will say this to me
the red car has gone...
no date today
my days of insomnia will continue!
I'm like a detective who have several identities
don't be surprised!
when I work as a dentist
I have another identity, which is a Jazz musician
when I'm a musician, I'm a dentist at the same time
long time no see...What do you want?
I don't know
how about Gimlet?
tasty as usual
I know what I want to drink now
Really? What is it?
same
after three glasses of Gimlet
I have a feeling that something is going to happen
there are two guys sitting with a pretty woman. They look familiar
there is also a man I've never met
I'm the detective today
Taxi!
follow the taxi ahead
wow, thank you!
I want you to give these to the guys at No. 135 and 136
I got it
sir
this is from No. 122
what?
is it Nagashima?
what are you doing here?
do you know each other?
are you alone?
Yes, I am
this is the dentist who gave me 30000 yen as transport fee
forget it!
you know Yuka?
he is my my friend's brother
I remember you have a beautiful sister
let me intoduce
this is Nagashima, my friend at univeristy
this is Shouku, medical equipment manufacturer
and...
my colleague, Yuri
it seems that my insomnia can be cured
I feel she is the one
the woman who can make me fall asleep happily
both Yuri and Mr Ku heads for Shinagawa

Wait...This is the fare. See you.
Bye. Goodnight.

I don't want to sleep yet

I wanted to see you, and then I really met you
we wouldn't have met ifthe timing was bad
we have to wait until next week before we can meet again

Excellent!
go home alone makes me feel lonely

no man has come here before
very dark
to make the world brighter
I'm going to buy you something

I don't like this
I saw a convenience store somewhere nearjust now
I want to give you a deeper impression upon my visit
I'm going
light bulb...

I came back quickly, didn't l?
Yes, you did, very quickly
I will turn off the light first

wow, very bright
Cheers!

this beer makes the world brighter

I've come only to have a drink

good night
HL libertine
hi playboy
What...you followed us?
I want to know how you drive her crazy
you're stupid
we both are
this is a common problem among dentists
we have ourwork done too early and have too much time at night
why isn't there any patient who has to come...
in an ambulance because of a decayed tooth?
we're so helpless
you like Yuka?
Yes. Why are you leaving so early?
I got a strange feeling once I entered her house
in fact I forgot to do some exercises
when we're still studying at school, I started to wonder why you're so popular
and now I know
you're honest
very much different from your appearance
go home quickly. You still have to work tomorrow
you're right
will I become popular if I learn to be a honest man, showing something different from my appearance?
good morning
I don't know why
there are a lot of new clients and all ofthem are young women
did you do anything?
no, I didn't
perhaps it's because I'm skillful
I wonder what kind of skill you mean
Yes, Nagashima's clinic
I'm sorry
we're fully booked today
thank you
ifthey are from Saidama, Chiba
Referthem to the Kamiyama Hospital
my friend at university welcomes young female clients
and he hates male clients a lot
such a sunny Sunday is annoying
hows work going to be?
wow, what a trendy car
whose car is it?
somebody's
don't scrawl on it
this is not a parking area
please drive it away
You're...I met you at the golf-course
it must be someone else
that car should have exceeded the parking time
I'll go and have a look
there're a few cars I have to check. Take your time
a police woman can take up part-time job?
those who obstruct the police in the course of their duty will be arrested will have bous credit
let's go somewhere and talk
you have to forget my uniform look during the day
I see no reason to stay with a girl who denies she works at Ginza
this is against the rule at Ginza
I may lose my job because ofthis
against the rule?
you can't approach the hostess outside the night club
why is there such a silly rule?
I can't agree with that
I'll have a shower
don't judge anybody according to his appearance or job
we should meet each other, naked
Ruriko, I slept well last night
my insomnia has been cured
I don't want to hear anything like that
not in the morning
you've already known what I wanted to say? Why?
you've told me already
no medicine can cure your insomnia
those who don't understand...
what you mean are jerks
women have good memories
but why aren't they interested in numbers?
are you talking to yourself?
I've told you already
don't murmurto yourself when I'm present
I asked Yuri if she's interested in music
she said she likes orchestral music
especially Nini's trumpet
her interest is different from mine
better not to tell hertoo much about myself
but to be frank, I want to sleep with her again tonight
no, not tonight
I'm sleepy
no, you can't
I don't understand what women think sometimes
let's chat a bit
we're usually naked when we're together
are you satisfied?
but it seems we don't understand each otherwell
let's talk more
what is your interest?
the art of sword
Oh I see
you've asked about that. No need to ask again
you plan not to marry in your whole life?
you've known it already?
marriage...
the one you love can be different from the one you marry
if possible, I want to be in love forthe rest of my life
you don't like kids?
I want to put more time in educating myself
you don't care even if no one cook and clean the house foryou?
I manage to do such things myself
so I won't get married because of such considerations
great
I hate cooking and cleaning
I've been looking for someone like you for a long time
will you marry me?
it seems to be a request from deep underthe sea
you didn't make such a decision because you want some memories, did you?
I have had only a few memories of love affairs but those on my living are uncountable
love affairs in one's living is what I want
many people suicide because of love affairs in their living
I've come to a conclusion
you won't marry me
I'll considerthat
consider...
I won't consider it!
you're avoiding me
you don't even answer my calls
I'm waiting foryou
bullshit!
I better hang around with Kamiyama
go to hell. I don't care any more
you sound like we've slept together
that's what you wanted, right?
you're right
then it makes no difference whether we've actually slept together or not
I forgot whose saying it is
consciousness can exceed real experience
must be someone who works in an art gallery
you have otherthings to do after work?
of course
shall we have a date?
it is stressful to be a dentist
I'm under pressure when I try to relax
you're funny
I want to date you
you need not work at the night club?
I quitted
you're so happy when you heard it
Hello, Yuka
they said you've quitted yourjob
sorry, I didn't tell you about that
no need to explain too much
you must have found a boyfriend
as your ex-customer, I congratulate you
congratulations, Nagashima
many young women have come to my clinic recently
I'm so busy right now
one ofthem has become my lifetime partner
I just want to tell you this
I will keep on
don't worry
I'll hang around with Yuri from now on
Yuka, don't mind his words
Kamiyama is a nice guy
I admire him a lot
I'll take you home
who are you really?
there're so many surprises today
you can play saxophone
and this car...what?
if I've killed somebody or I'm in fact a traid member you'll prefer dying, won't you?
I'll be very disappointed
you want to be the mistress of a gangster?
I long for that
I would be happy ifthe man I like showed her all his strengths
tomorrow is Sunday. Any plan?
to sleep all day long
I don't have anything special to do on Sunday
you'll spend the day alone?
if I feel lonely, can I ask you out?
of course
I'm not at home
please leave a message
it is the 34th time
my fingers are so tired
except that I'm mentally tired, it's in fact good for my body
please leave a message
I have to imagine the girl right beside me...
is the one whom I love most
what are you thinking?
can you swim?
no, I can't
Oh really?
have a cup oftea
better ifthe drink is good for blood circulation
but I only have this with me
I see. Tea is good
if bits of seaweed left between yourteeth
you aren't surprised, are you?
I feel like a fool
how come I brought with me such things
delicious
good that you've brought them with you
let's play cards
you have them now?
no, I just think it's the right thing to say now
I want it today
hold me
sure
show the whole Tokyo how we hold each other
wait. I'm a bit nervous
Yuka, what do you think about marriage
marriage?
I haven't thought about it
and I won't think about it in the next ten years
I'll not get married...
because I can't enjoy myself anymore after getting married
I won't consider it unless I become frustrated
how about you?
I've neverthought of it before
let's clean ourteeth together before we kiss
will you brush yourteeth, dentist?
no more seaweed. OK
it's easy to be moved and cry
a new patient has come
a weird girl
in fact, she is Yuri
you recognise me just from my mouth?
do you miss me?
I'm a dentist
I called you many times this Saturday
I went home
went home?
my father's place
you made me worried
it's natural to meet someone as astonishing as you in this way
it's natural to meet in this way...
you don't like this
you look troubled
I'm too happy that I feel troubled
wait
what kind of arrangement is this?
what arrangement?
a time-clash
I won't consider if she's your lover or not...
when I make an appointment
sorry about that
the client overthere needs some more time
please wait for a while
OK
let me have a look
where?
forget about the marriage
I'm sorry forwhat I said that day
I get tired of all those for malities
as long as you're with me, nothing else matters to me
of course
you don't have any decayed tooth
I'll remove the tartar
I wish I could give you a general anaesthetic
I saw that in a movie
then the dentist could do whatever he wanted
it is that movie that made me decide to be a dentist
there isn't any decayed tooth, really
you want to say healthy teeth is the result of an unhealthy body?
you're clever
wait, I'll go check the other patient
you can't say the same thing to her
I wish I could give you a general anaesthetic
a girlfriend who knows so well ofwhat men think is sometimes laughable
sorry to have kept you waitng
I was so happy last time
me too
I want it everyday
ifthe answerto my question is 'yes', give me paper
if' no', then rock
you had a colleague called Yuri...
when you worked in the night club
the one who has an affair with Kamiyama...
does she like men?
does she have any regular customers?
someone bought her houses and land
and of course clothes and cosmetics
someone did back her
not yet finished, need to mould yourtooth
Pleae wait for a moment
sorry to have kept you waitng
I feel like I've turned into the chair...
now wash yourteeth
it is rumoured that someone wealthy is backing you
if it's true, I'll have to call the police
is that true?
who said that?
am I like that kind of women?
myfamily is rich
my dad don'twant me to idle so he let me work as a policewoman
it's so annoying
is that what you said?
is that what you said?
you should check if it's true or not
make a phone call
so what do you want with such a look on your face?
I went on a short trip during weekend and took part in an overnight concert at a Jazz bar in Miryoku
it's an invaluable chance for me to think about...
women...and marriage...
what is my attitude?
let the saxophone tell me
the concert is marvellous
especially your performance
thank you
in a strange place
I'm delighted when I receive praise like this
it's time to go to bed?
I can't sleep well these days
I planned to buy some wine to drink
you want to visit the Morning Market?
you should go when your're in Miryoku
delicious
there is no exciting life here
I saw a picture ofTokyo in a magazine
what a pity
perhaps it's too excited, I've become apathetic
I want that kind of excitement in apathy
Mr. Nagashima, I want to go to Tokyo
I think you're the one who has come to bring me there
then let's go and have a look
come back when you become tired of it
I will go with you
please bring some changes to me
your expectation will make me feel troubled
my name is Nagashima, not Tokyo
please make me change
a woman will change no matter...
she is with a good guy or a bad guy
only those whose boyfriends...are lacking in perseverance won't change
the Tokyo Tower is beautiful
shall we go to the disco?
but I dress like this...
come on, I'll buy you some new clothes
one day
what?
in only one day, I've become a fashionable woman
see, that's Nagashima's car
there're many freaks in Tokyo, right?
that's true
how is it?
Avery nice house
these days when I was looking for a house
I was scouted by at lease ten people
forwhat?
to work as model, hostess or in Lovers' Club
then?
I believe among those who approached me...
there're someone trustworthy
I'm now confident in living in Tokyo
at least there're someone who will strike up a converstaion with me
of course everyone wants to talk to a girl like you
and I talked only to you
because it's you who brought me to Tokyo
it is a serious responsibility
so please stay here tonight
you aim at living in Tokyo
and now you've grown maturer
today is the memorial day ofthis house
I won't demand you to be with me tomorrow and the day after tomorrow
I just want a memory before I leave
this is not my first time
don't worry
I'm leaving
if I can't sleep alone
it's meaningless to come to Tokyo
people are a bit too cool here
but it is what Tokyo is
the more beautiful you think it is the cooler you will find it later
it has become the task of adults living in this cosmopolitic city to tell the truth to others
are you alright?
a double date is great, isn't it?
it won't become a weird habbit, right?
both ofthem are pretty
who is the woman in your car last time?
who is she?
nagashima is not getting married
he won't be tied down by a woman
it doesn't matter ifwe keep on like this
although it's disagreeable it's still betterthan losing you and suffering from lonliness
so we have no other choice but to accept it
both Yuka and I think in this way
you can fell in love with us at the same time
it doesn't matter even ifyou have a third girlfriend
but you can't make a favourite of any of us
ifyou have only six hours for dating
each of us will have two hours
a three-day holiday will also be shared out equally
Christmas and New Yearwill be divided...
into three sessions: morning, afternoon and night
one can enjoy a whole day on her birthday
we'll share yourtime equally in this way
it'll be difficult if I have 13 girlfriends
go to hell!
it's possible if I'm single
but in fact, I'm not
I've never invited you to come to my house
I've in fact a wife and three children
I'm such a bad guy. I'm sorry
why did you lie?
you couldn't have had any children
I like you a lot
I don't want to break up with you
OK, I'll bring you to my house
please come this Sunday
I'll go
where are they?
my wife Keiko
they're my eldest and second eldest sons
he is Sanro, my youngest son
they're my girlfriends, Yuka and Yuri
thank you fortaking care of my husband
the dishes are ready
yes
Mrs Nagashima, are you living in bliss?
yes
you're so happy
we want to share your happiness
welcome to my house anytime
you're welcome even ifyourteeth are healthy
I made all ofthe dishes
are they delicious?
Yes, honey
it's now a hot topic
a man who plays sax also plays tricks
a bad guy who is a dentist during the day
if it's published on magazines
it'll certainly become a talking point
thank you
I thank you too
I'm eager to see how he can cope with it
Really? Shall I put it as headline news
it'll be over if I say It's OK, right?
you don't want to say that, do you?
OK, no one will know it's a false tooth
you don't need me anymore
but we're still friends
don't forget to call me
I love you no matter what you've done
see you!
take care
good bye
welcome back
you want a shower or have dinnerfirst
which one?
you're not going home?
I have got used to living here
after all, this is a man's house
people will talk at your back
you won't like a girl who cares such things
I'm afraid of lonliness
I hate moving here and there
I'll stay here
let's get married
after all, I've pretended to be your wife
I'll give you the rest of my life
tokyo
she finally spoke of marriage
and she knows where I live
what to do?
what are you thinking?
Keiko, I have to leave Tokyo
to where?
I'll go to a Third World country...
and give dental care to the refugees there
I'll work there for at least five years
you won't say I'll go with you
I'll go with you
you said you'd be tranferred to Chicago, right?
I'll have to sell this house
and close the clinic
did you make up your mind suddenly?
I wanted to tell you about this a long time ago
but I couldn't
originally I decided to leave without telling you this
that's cruel!
Keiko, you're still young
but you hang around only with me
you can't see me as the best guy in this world
make a conclusion afteryou've gone out with at least ten guys
I've had over 16 boyfriends
Really?
just kidding
what else do you need?
yes... what do I need?
good that I can choose the wine myself
thank you
I won't come in the nearfuture
travel?
not willingly
come back quickly
I'll make you some new cocktails
I look forward to that
I'll drink one more cup and then go home
I got it
after a cup of cocktail
I walk on the street and start a new story
I look forward to coming here again
I come to my sister's house
I come here whenever I'm upset
it would be great if every woman was my sister
you're murmuring again
why don't you ask me to help dump your girlfriends?
in orderto save a ring you have to close your clinic now
yes
it'd be much better if I ask foryour help
you shouldn't regret it now
or you'll end up with a decayed tooth
Cheers!
I envy you. You're always my sister
you're always my brothertoo. I'll follow you everywhere
thank God
I don't believe in God
Cheers!
it's time to go
Keiko, take care
be a even more attractive woman...
when I come back next time
understand?
he has really left?
he gave you a goodbye kiss?
ifthere's anything wrong with yourteeth
I'll take care of that
don't worry
after this six-day trip to Guam what are we going to do?
I haven't made up my mind yet
I can live anywhere with my skills
you have no idea where you'll work at?
leave it forthe sunshine and sea of Guam to decide
who do you love most then?
I'm not telling you
are you alive?
Yes.
prove it.
it has begun.
make a hole! [ Chattering Continues ]
as I was saying, form follows function.
nowhere is this axiom of design more readily apparent than on board the world-famous Battlestar Galactica.
this ship, the last of her kind still in service.
was constructed over 50 years ago during the early days of the Cylon War.
originally there were 12 Battlestars, each representing one of Kobol's 12 colonies.
Galactica represented Caprica and was first commanded by Commander Nash
the Cylon war is long over. yet we must not forget the reasons why-- "
commander Adama. if I may? Captain.
I just wanted to say what a pleasure it's been serving with you in your command.
captain Kelly. it's been my honor. Good luck in your next assignment.
thank you. sir.
the Cylon war is long over. yet-- " Good morning. sir.
good morning. Starbuck. What do you hear?
nothing but the rain.
grab your gun and bring in the cat. Boom. boom. boom.
attention. Honor guard detail...
report to starboard hangarbay for ceremonial briefiing and rehearsal.
let's go. guys. Chiefs gonna have our ass.
Yeah. well. you're the one that was supposed to wrap that yesterday.
Shh. It's the old man.
too late. What's up?
nothing. sir. Just another leak in that ""frakin " ' window.
pardon me. sir.
it's supposed to be a Battlestar. not a museum.
sorry for saying so. sir.
couldn't agree with you more. Be careful out there. all right?
the Cylon War is long over. yet we cannot forget the reasons why-- "
morning. sir. Good morning.
mostly housekeeping. Uh. there was one odd message we were copied on.
the one from Fleet Headquarters there. sir.
courier officer's overdue coming back from Armistice Station.
they've asked for a full status report on all F.T.L.-capable ships...
just in case they need somebody to jump out there today
see if his ship has any mechanical problems.
I think we're a little bit busy today. Wouldn't you say so. Lieutenant?
Yes. sir. I'm glad we agree.
and may I take this opportunity to say that it's been both a pleasure...
and an honor to serve under you these past three years.
it's my honor. Lieutenant Gaeta.
the Cylon War is long over
Colonel?
you'll see things here that look odd or even antiquated
hello. Antiquated to modern eyes.
phones with cords. awkward manual valves computers that barely deserve the name.
it was all designed to operate against an enemy...
who could infiltrate and disrupt even the most basic computer systems.
Galactica is a reminder of a time when we were so frightened by our enemies...
that we literally looked backward for protection.
attention all hands
morning.
attention on deck!
chief. At ease. Sir.
this way.
haven't seen one of these in about 20 years.
if the commander will take a closer look... at the tail numbering.
nebula 72 42 Constellation.
Oh. my God. Where did you find her?
rusting out in a salvage yard on Sagittarian.
we had hoped the commander would allow her to participate in the decommissioning ceremony.
she'll fly? Oh, yes, sir.
Ah. We've restored the engines.
patched the guidance system, Replaced much of the flight control
you guys are amazing. She's fueled, armed,
ready for launch, sir. Commander.
somebody's bucking for a promotion around here.
I believe that would be Prosna. sir.
he found this in the fleet archives.
he was doing some research for the museum.
thank you. Thank you all. It's an honor.
you're welcome. sir. Fall out.
attention.
prior to 2300 hours.
here we go. If you're gonna play with the big dogs
no fear. I'm in. Bet's to you, X. O.
I"m in. I'm not scared of you.
Oh. Hello. When are you gonna learn? First you're flying with rooks. and then
and then you're betting against Starbuck.
Starbuck. Now there's a call sign.
Where'd you get that nickname. anyway?
was that before you were thrown in the brink as a cadet for drunk and disorderly or after?
after. After. That's right. It was after.
I'm in. Bet's to you. X. O.
I"m in. Stay.
how's the wife?
too early for that kind of money.
Hey, did you hear about that pyramid game on Geminon?
what weRe you doing on Geminon?
this girl there I know. What girl don't you know?
the wife is just fine.
talk to her lately? Bet's to you, Lieutenant.
all right.
thirty to me.
and it looks like I"m gonna bring this lovely little game to a close...
because... full colors! [ Laughs ]
[ indistinct Yelling ] Stop!
okay. I'm fine. I'm fine. Hey. hey. hey.
you have finally gone too far...
and now you're done.
lieutenant. consider yourself under arrest. pending charges.
report to the brig.
gentlemen.
are you really gonna press charges against Kara?
for striking a superior officer? You're damned right I am.
heard you started the day off pretty early.
I wasn't on duty.
[ Chuckles ] Now. where did you get this?
Tyrol's deck gang scrounged it up.
I couldn't talk you out of it. could I? Not a chance.
she is insubordinate. undisciplined.
probably one of the fiinest fiighter pilots I've ever seen in my life.
Yeah. She's better than I am.
twice as good as you. Like hell.
[ Chuckles ] Jesus.
listen. I'm not gonna defend what she did.
especially the cracks about your marital problems.
but you did kick over the table first.
I did not.
unless I did.
you did.
so what do you say we just drop the formal charges...
throw her in the brig. cool her heels off until we get home?
you always did have a soft spot for her.
Yeah. I guess I'm just a crazy old man.
I'm afraid the tests are positive. The mass is malignant.
it's advanced well beyond the-- [ Loud Rumbling ]
so I also sent the president a copy of your speech for Galactica's retirement.
hopefully, he'll have a chance to review it...
but there is a 30-minute time delay between the Galactica and
excuse me. - Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain. Welcome aboard.
we are in route to Galactica...
and our estimated flight time is approximately fiive and a half hours.
please sit back and relax and enjoy your flight.
I'll take two!
all Right.
how small they are. I know.
but they grow up so fast. May I?
sure. [ Laughs ]
there.
[ baby Fussing ] So light.
[ crying ] So fragile.
Shh. shh. shh. shh. There. there. It's okay.
you're not gonna have to cry much longer.
we really should be going.
of course. [ Baby Fussing ]
it's amazing how the neck can support that much weight.
Chantara. Honey. Let"s go.
I gotta show you something.
okay. Yeah. Come on.
[ Chantara Laughs ] Give me a moment.
[ neck Snaps ]
[ Chantara ] Just a second.
I'll go with you.
[ Chantara Screaming ] My God! He"s not breathing!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! He"s not breathing!
my baby! [ Sobbing ]
for those of you just joining us from the Pyramid game on Geminon...
welcome to The Spotlight...
our weekly interview program devoted to people making news on Caprica.
today we're talking with Dr. Gaius Baltar...
winner of three Magnate Awards over the course of his career.
a media cult fiigure and a personal friend of President Adar's, he is currently working as a top consultant for the Ministry of Defense on computer issues.
but he's perhaps best known for his controversial views on advancing computer technology.
Dr. Baltar, again, welcome.
thank you. Kellan. Firstly. may I say how lovely you're looking...
and secondly. what an absolute pleasure it is to be on the show.
well, we're delighted to have you with us.
could you summarize your views for our audience?
[ BaltaR] Yes, I'd be happy to.
my position is very simple.
the ban on research and development into artifiicial intelligence, is, as we all know, a hold over from the Cylon Wars.
quite fRankly, I fiind this to be an outmoded concept.
it serves no useful purpose except to impede our efforts
miss me?
can't you tell?
your body misses me. but what about your heart. your soul?
Yeah. those too.
do you love me. Gaius? What?
do you love me? Are you serious?
you had me worried there for a minute.
[ Gaius Grunts ] I'm hot. Gaius.
I'm so hot!

on behalf of Galactica, I'd like to welcome you aboard. Apollo. It's an honor to have you with us.
morning. sir. ChiefTyrol.
I'll be your crew chief while you're aboard.
morning. Chief. Captain Lee Adama.
it's a real pleasure to... meet you. sir.
I'm sure you've heard this before. I'm a great admirer of your father's.
the service is gonna miss him when he retires.
well. I'm sure someone will. Is your auto-landing system down?
I was hands-on for the whole approach.
it's all hands-on here. Captain.
there are no auto-landings on the Galactica.
commander Adama's orders.
is that right?
attention in the port hangarbay.
Raptor touching down. Clear. The checker is red.
nice flying. Lieutenant. I think they heard that clear up to the bridge.
Yeah. I'm gonna catch hell from the L. S.O. but it wasn't entirely my fault.
primary gimbal's acting up again. Oh. it's the gimbal's fault again?
hello. am I lying? Gimbal looked bad to me.
I've pulled that gimbal three times and stripped it twice.
the gimbal's not the problem. sir. You're not listening to me. Chief.
I listen very closely to what each and every one of my pilots has to say.
you're not the one out there trying to bring in 50 tons of Raptor onto a moving hangar deck with a bad gimbal.
I've got 1 0 years experience... - Here we go.
breaking down and stripping every component and every system
[ Together] That's ever been installed in every spacecraft on my hangar deck.
the gimbal is broken. Shut up. sir.
morning. Morning, sir!
all right. Today is the main event.
we have a formation demonstration. flyby maneuvers...
in conjunction with the decommissioning ceremony.
I've got a few changes to the flight plan.
lieutenant Thrace is being replaced in the slot by Lieutenant Anders.
also. we have Captain Lee Adama joining us.
and he's gonna be flying lead during the flyby, so please welcome Captain.
good to have you. Welcome, Apollo. Welcome aboard, Captain.
great. Welcome.
thanks to Chief Tyrol and his deck gang. Captain.
you're gonna have the honor offlying the actual Viper that your father flew almost 40 years ago.
great. That's. um-- That's quite an honor.
[ CAG ] Yes, it is, Captain.
and personally I can't think of a better way to send this ship into retirement.
it may interest you to know that the final results for the C. N.P. project are:
working close to 95% efficiency throughout the fleet.
hold your applause. please. No applause for me?
I doubt you would've ever completed the project without me.
Yes. well. you helped a bit. I rewrote half your algorithms.
all right. you were extremely helpful.
but let's not forget you got something out of it.
all that poking around inside the Defense mainframe.
should give you a huge advantage bidding for the contract next year.
you know that's not really why I did it. No. you did it 'cause you love me.
that. and God wanted me to help you.
right. He spoke to you. did he? You had a chat?
he didn't speak to me in a literal voice.
and you don't have to mock my faith.
sorry. I'm just not very religious.
does it bother you that I am?
it puzzles me that an intelligent. attractive woman such as yourself...
should be taken in by all that mysticism and superstition.
but I'm willing to overlook it on account of your other attributes.
I have to go. I'm meeting someone.
Really? Who is he? I'm insanely jealous.
I doubt that.
so touchy today.
well. as a matter of fact. I'm meeting someone too. Business.
a new project at Defense I might do.
so. uh.
you'll call me later. right?
it's about time. I wondered when you'd get here.
[ man ] SecRetary Roslin. Yes.
Mr. "Kickay." - Keikeya.
Oh. sorry. Hi. Hi.
my name's Aaron Doral. I'm from Public Relations.
I'd like to welcome you aboard Galactica. Thank you.
if you'll follow me. I'll show you to your quarters.
[ man On P. A.] Attention all hands.
at this time, Galactica would like to welcome aboard the secretary of education, Laura Roslin.
the secretary is a member of the president"s cabinet.
we're honored by her presence aboard our ship...
and her participation this afternoon in Galactica's decommissioning ceremony.
madam Secretary?
madam Secretary?
[ man Chatting On Phone ] Yes. that's exactly what I would think.
[ man On P. A.] Attention all hands. E. V. A. activity on hull.
do not radiate any electrical equipment while E. V. A. is in progress.
thank you.
in or out.
excuse me? Get in or get out.
shut the hatch. Sorry.
where are you trying to be?
uh. visitor's quarters. I'm a visitor.
[ Chuckles ] Yeah. Never would've guessed.
it tells people things like where the rest room is.
it's an integrated computer network. and I will not have it aboard this ship.
I heard you're one of those people. You're actually afraid of computers.
no. There are many computers on this ship. but they're not networked.
a computerized network would simply make it faster and easier for the teachers to be able to teach
let me explain something to you.
many good men and women lost their lives aboard this ship...
because someone wanted a faster computer to make life easier.
I'm sorry that I'm inconveniencing you or the teachers...
but I will not allow a network computerized system...
to be placed on this ship while I'm in command.
is that clear? Yes. sir.
thank you. Excuse me.
this seems familiar.
captain Adama. sir.
sorry I wasn't there to greet you with the rest of the squadron.
did they kiss your ass to your satisfaction?
so. what's the charge this time?
striking a superior asshole.
Ah. I bet you've been waiting all day to say that one.
most of the afternoon. yeah. Right.
so. how long's it been?
two years. Two years. We must be getting old.
seems like the funeral was just a couple months ago.
Yeah.
your old man's doin' fine. We don't talk about it much.
maybe two or three times a year. He still struggles with it. though.
I haven't seen him. Why not?
Kara. don't even start. How long are you gonna do this?
I'm not doing anything. He lost his son. Lee.
and who's responsible for that?
same old Lee. You haven't changed either.
Zak was my brother.
what was he to me? Nothin'?
that's not what I meant. And you know what
you know what? You should go.
I'm gettin' the urge to hit another superior asshole.
what are you doing here? Who the hell are you?
get out.
Gaius. who is this woman?
uh. she's a friend. Well. more than a friend. When I say friend
get out.
this is just gReat.
look. it's. uh-- It's me. all right?
It-It-It"s totally me.
I screwed up.
I am screwed up. I always have been.
it's a. uh-- It's a flaw in my character that I have.
I've always hated it and I've tried
spare me your feigned self-awareness and remorse.
I came here because I have something to tell you.
Oh. here he is. If you'd just like to
a little space. Captain. thank you for joining us.
if you'd just like to stand up there. we'll get a few shots of you...
and the commander.
Thanks.
hello. Captain.
great. Okay, gentlemen, could you maybe stand a bit closer?
fantastic. Um. Commander.
could you put your arm around your son?
great. Perfect.
okay. Thank you very much. Um. see you at the ceremony.
we'll just be leaving this-- through this doorway and to our right.
[ woman On P. A.] Attention, honor guard detail, report to starboard hangarbay.
you want some, uh, coffee?
no. sir. Thank you. sir.
why don't you sit down?
congratulations on making captain. Sorry I wasn't there.
thank you. sir.
how's your mother? Getting married.
good for her.
we spoke about a year ago. Had a real heart-to-heart. It was good.
I'm glad to hear that. sir. Will that be all?
why don't you talk to me. Lee? What do you want to talk about?
anything. You've been here for an hour. Well. I don't have anything to say.
my orders said report here and participate in the ceremony.
so I'm-I'm here. and I'm gonna participate in the ceremony.
there wasn't anything in my orders about having any heart-to-heart chats with the old man.
accidents happen in the service.
dad. listen. I
you know all the things that you talked to me about at the funeral-- I really don't want to do this!
they still ring in my ears after two years. Good!
good. 'Cause-- 'Cause you know what? They were meant to.
Zak had a choice. You both did.
a man isn't a man until he wears the wings of a Viper pilot. "
doesn't that sound at all familiar to you?
that's not fair. son.
no. it's not fair.
because one of us wasn't cut out to wear the uniform.
he eaRned his wings, just like we all did. One of us wasn't cut out to be a pilot.
one of us wouldn't have made it into flight school...
if his old man. his daddy. hadn't pulled the strings!
that's an exaggeration.
I did nothing for him that I wouldn't have done for anyone else.
you're not even listening to me.
wh-why can't you get this through your head?
Zak did not belong in that plane!
he shouldn't have been there.
he-he was only doing it for you.
face it. You killed him.
that'll be all. Captain.
so now you"Re telling me, um
now you're telling me you're a machine.
I'm a woman. You're a machine.
you're a synthetic woman.
a robot.
I've said it three times now. Well. forgive me.
I'm having the tiniest little bit of trouble believing that.
the last time anybody saw the Cylons. they looked like walking chrome toasters.
those models are still around. They have their uses.
prove it.
if you're a Cylon. prove it to me right now.
I don't have to. You know I'm telling the truth.
see. stating something as the truth doesn't necessarily make it so...
cause the truth of the matter is I don't believe a word of it.
you believe me because deep down you've always known there was something different about me
something that didn't quite add up in the usual way.
and you believe me because it flatters your ego to believe that alone. among all the billions of people of the Twelve Colonies.
you were chosen for my mission.
your mission? What mission?
you knew I wanted access to the Defense mainframe.
the-- Wait a minute.
the Defense mainframe? What exactly are you saying?
come on. Gaius. The communications frequencies?
deployment schedules? Unlimited access to every database?
Oh. my God.
I had nothing to do with this.
you know I had nothing to do with this.
you have an amazing capacity for self-deception.
how do you do that?
how many people know about me. specifically? That I'm involved?
and even now. as the fate of your entire world hangs in the balance...
all you can think about is how this affects you.
do you have any idea what they will do to me if they find out?
they'd probably charge you with treason.
treason is punishable by the death penalty.
this is unbelievable. What are you doing?
phoning my attorney. That won't be necessary.
he'll know what to do. He'll sort this out. He's the best in the business.
it won't be necessary. because in a few hours...
no one will be left to charge you with anything.
what exactly are you saying?
humanity's children are returning home... today.
I'd like to thank you all again for being here.
and, Elosha, thank you very much for those wonderful words.
next is a ceremonial flyby by the last Galactica squadron led by Captain Lee Adama.
and now it is my great pleasure to introduce the last commander of the Battlestar Galactica, Commander Adama.
thank you very much.
the Cylon War is long over.
yet we must not forget the reasons why so many sacrificed so much in the cause of freedom.
the cost of wearing the uniform can be high...
but
sometimes it's too high.
you know. when we fought the Cylons.
we did it to save ourselves from extinction.
but we never answered the question. why?
why are we as a people worth saving?
we still commit murder because of greed, spite, jealousy.
and we still visit all of our sins upon our children.
[ Adama On Headpiece ] We refuse to accept the responsibility for anything that we've done.
like we did with the Cylons.
we decided to play God.
create life.
[ Adama On Speaker] When that life turned against us, we comforted our selves in the knowledge...
that it really wasn"t our fault, not really.
you cannot play God then wash your hands of the things that you've created.
sooner or later. the day comes...
when you can't hide from the things that you've done anymore.
you are one surprising son of a bitch.
[ lee On SpeakeR] Colonial Heavy 798, this is Viper 7242.
my call sign is Apollo, and I'll be your escort back to Caprica.
[ pilot ] Copy that, Viper 7 2 42. Glad to have you with us, Apollo.
[ woman On Radio ] Viper 7242, Raptor 312.
this is Boomer. Just wanted to say it was an honor to fly with you, Apollo.
[ pilot On Speaker] Ladies and gentlemen, we are now in route back to Caprica.
if you look out the, uh, starboard window, you might be able to see one of Galactica's old Mark II Vipers, which will be escorting us back home.
[ female Newscaster] We don't have any further information yet.
[ male Newscaster] There are no remaining ships able to leave Caprica.
but no actual enemy has been sighted yet.
officials are saying there doesn't seem any doubt
what have I done?
what am I gonna do?
there's no way out.
I know. I'm sure you know.
that's your doing. isn't it?
wait. Wait. There has to be another way out of here.
I mean-- I mean. you must have an escape plan.
you're not about to be destroyed by your own bombs. are you?
how are you leaving? [ Screams ]
Gaius. I can't die.
when this body is destroyed. my memory. my consciousness.
will be transmitted to a new one.
I'll just wake up somewhere else in an identical body.
you mean there's more out there like you?
there are 12 models. I'm Number Six.
I don't want to die. I don't-- Get down.
[ Gaeta On Intercom ] C. I.C. to commanding officer.
go ahead. - I'm sorry to disturb you. sir.
but we have a priority one alert message from Fleet Headquarters.
it was transmitted in the clear.
in the clear? What does it say?
attention all colonial units.
Cylon attack underway.
this is no drill. "
I'll be right there.
[ Gaeta On P. A.] Action stations, action stations.
set condition one throughout the ship. This is not a drill.
repeat. Action stations, action stations.
set condition one throughout the ship. This is not a drill.
repeat. Action stations, action stations.
set condition one throughout the ship. This is not a drill.
not a drill? They can't be serious. Sounds like it to me.
what are we gonna shoot with? The ship's got no ammunition.
all right. people. let's go. Let's get this hangar bay ready for possible incoming.
what have we got? Shipping accident?
combat? Understood.
condition one is set. All decks report ready for action. sir.
very well.
this is a joke. The fleet's playing a joke on you.
it's a retirement prank. Come on. I don't think so.
this is the commander.
moments ago this ship received word of a Cylon attack against our home worlds is under way.
we do not know the size or the disposition or the strength of the enemy forces.
but all indications point...
to a massive assault against Colonial defenses.
Admiral Nagala has taken personal command of the fleet...
following complete destruction of Picon Fleet Headquarters in the fiirst wave of the attacks.
how. why...
doesn't really matter now.
what does matter is that. as of this moment. we are at war.
you"ve tRained foRthis.
you're ready for this.
stand to your duties. trust your fellow shipmates...
and we'll all get through this.
further updates as we get them. Thank you.
war with the Cylons.
all right. people. this is what we do.
we're the best. so let's get the old girl ready to roll and kick some Cylon ass!
come on! Let's go! Move!
this better be for real.
tactical. - Sir?
begin a plot of all military units in the solar system. friendly or otherwise.
X. O. Sir?
we're in a shooting war. We need something to shoot.
I'll start checking munitions depots.
send a signal to our fighter squadron.
I want positions and tactical status immediately.
Yes. sir. And get Kara Thrace out of the brig.
boomer, acknowledge Galactica's signals and send them ourposition.
boomer, acknowledge Galactica's signals and send them ourposition.
tell them we've detected a formation of Cylon fighters directly ahead. and I intend to attack.
boomer, do you copy?
copy that. Ease up there. Boomer.
take a deep breath.
stand by. Helo?
I show 1 0.
no. no. make that five Cylon raiders on course 3 2 4-mark-1 1 0.
speed. 7. 1 .
time to intercept. seven minutes.
you don't sound too sure. A lot of jamming going on.
Cylons are using a lot of sensor decoys. Sorting through them. but
understood. Just take your time. guide us in. We'll do the rest.
[ Sharon ] Yes, sir.
so that would put our squadron about here.
now. looks like the main fight is shaping up over here near Virgon's orbit.
but even at top speed. they're still over an hour away.
[ Adama ] Plot a course along this axis.
if we can keep Virgon between us and the battle, we might be able to get pretty close before the Cylons are even aware. [ Gaeta ] At least, sir.
commander. ready for duty. sir. Good.
where the hell did the Cylons come from?
all we know for sure is they achieved complete surprise and we're taking heavy losses.
we lost 30 Battlestars in the opening attack.
that's a quarter of the fleet. I need pilots. and I need fighters.
pilots you got. There's 20 of us climbing the walls down in the ready room.
but fighters
I think I seem to remember an entire squadron of fighters...
down on the starboard hangar deck yesterday.
Yes. sir.
you sure they'll fly?
the reactor's still hot. so all we have to do is pull the rad buffers from the engine.
refuel it. load the ordnance. and you're ready to go.
the biggest problem is getting them over to the port launch bay.
why can't we use the starboard launch? It's a gift shop now.
frak me. All right. let's go!
everybody pick a bird! We're going to the port launch bay!
what's the latest. D? A lot of confusion.
I keep getting these weird reports about equipment malfunctions.
why is that weird? It's the number of malfunctions.
one report said an entire Battlestar lost power...
just before it came in contact with the enemy.
they said it was like someone just turned off a switch.
Cylon formation ahead. We're down to two confirmed Cylons now.
approaching visual range.
okay. Boomer. we'll take it from here. You back way off.
Roger that.
all Right, boys and girls, you break into attack for mation.
there might only be two of them. but I want you to stick with your wingman and do not get overconfident.
[ male Pilot ] Anybody know what these things look like?
[ female Pilot ] Pictures I"ve seen of the old Cylon fiighters were sort of like a big flying wing.
[ male Pilot ] Those pictures are 40 years old.
okay. keep the chatter down. [ Over Radio ] CAG. Boomer.
we've got a lot more contacts showing up. Looks like a couple of squadrons. at least.
all Vipers. weapons free.
let's go get them.
[ static ] What the
I've lost power.
jolly. Jolly. take over.
jolly. can you read me?
what are they doing?
I don't know. They're going straight in.
COM chatter's gone. They're not talking anymore.
CAG. Boomer. Do you read?
boomer, this is CAG.
if you can hear me they must've done something to our computer system.
some sort of electronic jamming. I've never seen anything like this.
there's no cockpits.
nobody's flying these things.
Oh. my God.
No!
boomer. get us out of here! Right.
[ man ] Once again. we are processing the information that we have been given.
and I urge you all to try to stay calm.
as we get more information. I will pass it along to you.
we appreciate your patience. Thank you.
what's going on? I'm not sure.
any luck over there. Captain? No. Just picking up a lot of confusing chatteR.
well. to be honest with you. I'm kind of glad you're sticking around.
makes us all feel better just seeing you out there.
well, don't get too comfortable.
this old junker I'm in was meant for show, not combat.
if we run into a problem. I'll do what I can to protect you.
but the first sign of trouble. you pour on the speed and you run.
don't you worry about that. I got my hand on the throttle.
it hasn't left since I got that first message.
colonial Heavy 798 out.
two missiles now.
