who was his friend? - Chandra somethin' , that's all I know.
sit tight, Buster. We may be back.
and Philly Soul was the next step from Motown.
takes me back, man.
cruisin' in the drop-top, Billy Paul on the eight track.
never heard of him. - Come on, man, how about The Intruders?
Delfonics? - Nope.
all right, you got to at least know " Love Train.
Yeah, song from the beer commercial.
you're an ass, man.
needle in a haystack with this bottle label.
state liquor store had nothing like it in stock.
so long ago, bottle might not even be manufactured anymore.
they didn't recognize it from anything back then either.
hit up the Liquor Control Board, see what I can find.
this Chandra girl-- Chandra Patterson.
on the list we got from Billy's dad.
how come choir girl never came forward after he was killed?
Lil, you know this kid over here?
that's the same dude from yesterday.
uniforms picked him up on a D&D, asked for you.
Thanks.
you asked for me?
uh, I did?
what's your name? Why'd you ask for me?
downstairs, your name's on that board thing.
try again. You came in yesterday.
give me your I. D.
Sean Thomason. Really?
that's a pretty good fake.
what do you, uh, what do you do here?
homicide. Why?
you got info on a case? - Homicide?
well, that's cool.
how long have you worked here?
what's with the personal questions?
he's a D-K. Put him dostairs, let him sleep it off.
everything cool? - Kid stinks.
so, looks like Chandra's still at it in the church. Only now she's the choir director.
Billy and Tommy were like older brothers.
we'd sneak out of church events, find Motown or Stax on the radio.
where were you the night Billy was killed?
home with my parents. I didn't really go out much on the weekends.
only when you went with Billy to Ronde's studio.
you never told the police he worked at Ronde Records.
Billy's parents lost both sons eight months apart.
I didn't want to add insult to injury.
well, might've helped solve his murder.
Billy changed from the boy I knew.
he was drinking a lot.
started losing himself in the studio scene.
but you wanted to be in that scene.
thought I was gonna be the next Aretha, but Ronde could care less about gospel vocals.
well, the way we heard it, Ronde stopped you at the gate.
no. I got my chance to shine, and it was all because of Billy.
where the heck is Billy?
I'm here. I'm here.
I couldn't split organ practice early. Dad stayed the whole time.
all right, we're gonna need separate mics.
and ladies. There you go. There you go. Follow my lead.
Billy, what the hell?
don't worry, you can pay me when it's a hit.
start us off.
tempo up.
just a bit.
rhythm section.
guitar.
strings. Horns.
choir, come on now.
the Lord is good to all, and his tender mercies are on all his works.
and boy, was the Lord good to Billy.
I know that song. It was a pretty big hit, huh?
sound that launched the label.
he was Philly Soul.
I still have the sheet music.
you know, Billy footed the bill for all those musicians.
where did he get that money?
well, not from what Ronde paid him. I'll tell you that.
I don't remember a woman's voice on the track.
when they recorded it, they swapped me out for three men who sang falsetto and could dance.
Ronde's call. That's just the way it was.
Oh, Billy didn't get from the old man; he'd never approve.
unless Billy was dipping into the donations basket. Pass the hot sauce.
well, the father could tell us who handled the church finances.
if they're still alive.
what's up, Will?
liner notes.
see something off, guys?
huh. Music, lyrics, and arrangements.
Ronde's a one-man show.
chandra said Billy wrote that song.
so, why is Ronde getting sole credit for the track that launched the label?
steal a little, you're a thief.
you steal a lot, you're a king.
get up, Finn Cooper.
unless you want me to give this to your dad.
you mean, our dad?
must have really wanted to meet me.
Yeah, I guess.
so, what do you want to know?
just wanted to see what you look like, okay?
did you call my dad?
not my place. You could have saw me two days ago.
Yeah, but there were all these cops and people around.
it's kind of how it is around here.
I don't know. What was I gonna say?
so, you get your load on, jammed up.
there's easier ways. You always drink like this?
no. You know...It's just like, things are one way.
then it's, like, there's this other sister.
they say you might be coming by?
Yeah. I mean, well, I don't know about that.
Yeah. It's, like, weir right?
so, uh...
so, what happened with you and Dad? - What do you mean?
it's like he's got this whole other life before.
but I've never even seen a picture of the guy before he was like, 45, so...
I guess there's some things he didn't want you to know. - Like what?
well, you have to ask him.
Yeah, right.
you need an officer to drive you home?
I can go? - Don't make a habit of it, okay?
uh, yeah. No, I'll take the bus. Thanks.
you know, you don't need to get locked up every time you want to see me.
the great Ronde Brooks.
I'm staring at those gold records, thinking, "Damn, if I had a tenth of that talent.
but it was Billy's talent. The real innovator.
excuse me?
Billy wrote this. Yet I can't find his name anywhere.
that's some cold jealousy.
what happened when Billy learned you cuffed his song?
cuffed his song?
you know how many people steal my stuff and call it their own?
see, that's what lawyers are for, and I think I'd like mine. Now.
sure. Course, takes some time to process.
lifetime achievement award.
might have to miss the ceremony.
all right.
so, Billy should have gotten credit.
and one thing I know, when a guy's in trouble, he tends to make hasty decisions.
Baltimore? - You're drinking all the time now.
suddenly, you care about that?
things are different now, Billy.
you owe cash to some really dangerous people.
that was to make the record.
you think Ronde cares?
you think he's ever going to pay you?
you used to believe in me.
I do. Baby, I believe you can do anything yo want to.
but you're under Ronde's thumb. You know, and your dad controls every...
you don't know anything about that.
well, I know you won't even introduce me to your family.
because I'm not... I'm not from the church.
damn it, Billy.
once I make it big, that'll all change.
no, it won't.
look at you.
I mean, what do you want?
you want to fill your brother's shoes?
do you want to be your own person?
for us.
when you're ready to be a father, you let me know.
you break it, you pay for it!
you owe me money, Ronde.
you need to get some things in order.
give you enough so she can go take care of it.
I don't want to take care of it!
ronde, this is my song on the radio. My song!
when it's picked up nationally, it'll be huge.
ososare my lyrics. - And my arrangements and my music.
I did not authorize those extra musicians.
you'll get paid when I get paid.
you still work for me, son. - Not anymore.
want out of your contract?
pay you for the credit. Keep your mouth shut.
never have to see me again.
ten grand. - Five. Not a penny more.
fine.
I got plenty more hits in me.
the kid help?
Yeah, sure. Sure, he helped.
but he couldn't handle his own business.
hell, I've had 13 gold records since he died.
I'm a master at what I do.
you know who loaned him the money for the orchestra?
there's only one bank in Philly a black musician would have went to for that kinda cash.
the Bank of Geraldine.
the Liquor Control Board couldn't ID our label, but I got a list of local distributors that would have shipped the dark bottles back in 1970.
well, they can I. D. it, maybe they know where the bottle was shipped.
I already sent them the label.
had an interesting chat with my buddy in Vice.
Geraldine was more than a numbers runner. - You don't say.
Yeah, investigated her a few years back for loan sharking.
not enough to charge her, I take it.
no, but one sap they picked up begged to stay in lockdown.
scared her goons would break his legs over 200 bucks.
Billy owed a lot more than that.
that's why he needed money from Ronde.
maybe heading to pay her back when he got jumped.
Hey, come on, Serpico. It's your lucky day.
time for some real detective work.
nice to see you again, Queen Bee.
don't see numbers running on the menu.
I told you everything I know about Billy.
left out you were pretty heavy in the loan sharking game.
not afraid to pop some kneecaps.
Billy owed you some major coin.
okay, you got a warrant?
Oh, you want a warrant? That's cool.
Yeah, it'll just take, say, a few weeks.
in the meantime, your friendly neighborhood officer will stand post, make sure business is on the up and up.
okay, all right, listen.
Billy did owe me money. And he paid me back.
only his timing couldn't have been worse.
Hey. What you doing here, sweetie?
um, hey, Geraldine. I got your money. $2, 500. It's all there. You can count it.
no, th- that's fine. Um, thanks.
Thanks. Thanks, sweetie.
I've never seen Tom so shook up.
I mean, he had a reputation to protect.
that's a pretty big scandal, you hitting it with the Reverend.
not my proudest moment.
but being with him made me feel better about myself.
Tom know Billy saw the cufflinks?
I ed, said he hadn't, and Tom didn't believe me.
so, he went after him?
I don't know for certain. I mean, considering what happened...
I sure hope not.
Hey, Billy didn't take from the church, but get this.
clerk said she got an anonymous donation right after Billy died with orders for his headstone.
$2, 500 bucks.
that's the exact amount Billy had on him.
found where our label came from.
Philadelphia Winery. - Communal wine.
explains why our label wasn't in a state store.
Oh, it was shipped to church supply shops, including one down the street from Tom's church.
father catches son on the street, and they get into an argument.
dad gets the last word.
well, it looks like that anonymous donation was made with blood money.
told us you didn't know anything about a place called The Hive, Tom.
that's true.
so you don't know anything about Geraldine Watkins, either?
miss Watkins is a part of the congregation.
has been for 50 years. - On Sunday, sure.
but you were tending flock with a separate congregation on the side.
believe me, I've been making amends over that for 39 years.
recognize this?
bottle of wine from our church.
same kind of bottle that killed Billy.
must have hurt when he found out you were a liar and a cheat.
not to mention a hypocrite, Tom.
I know I was flawed as a husband and as a preacher, - but I loved my son. - Did you go after Billy that night, Tom?
I did.
searched all over.
I only wish it would have gone differently when I found him.
I was at the house.
mother said you packed some things.
everything okay, son?
something on your mind?
I'm leaving home, Dad.
I'm gonna start my life away from your church.
you'll do no such thing. - The music I do it's not some sin.
it's me.
you'd know that if you'd just listen to it.
what does it profit a man to gain the whole world... - The whole world ...and lose his soul? I can quote scripture, too. I just see things different.
what I do-- it's like my own sermon, you know?
how dare you disgrace me like this.
how am I disgracing you? - Hanging with that element.
going around town, borrowing money.
how do you know about that, huh?
from Geraldine?
you've got no right to question me, boy. I'm your father.
then act like it for once.
your brother's looking down on you now.
I'm not Tommy! Don't you get it?
he told me he was glad that he got drafted. - Don't you talk about your brother.
so he could get away from you.
they took the wrong son.
you judge me, but your preaching is as empty as your soul.
the sins of the father do visit the son.
what did you do after Billy left, Tom?
went home... to my wife.
couldn't even look her in the eye.
one thing keeps troubling us.
a stranger makes a donation for Billy's headstone, and you're cool with it?
that headstone was gorgeous.
it was inscribed with Psalm 145.
the Lord is good to all, and his tender mercies are on all his works.
whoever did that knew my son better than me.
all he wanted was my acceptance.
and I couldn't give it to him.
Billy has a son who wants to meet you.
maybe now you got a second chance.
who else had access to the wine, Tom?
we heard it was the choir director. StStilis.
we got this at the church.
who is that listed as the choir director from '70 to '71?
you don't recognize your own mother, Chandra?
what does any of this have to do with Billy?
it was exciting being at the studio with Billy, huh?
the one time, yeah, but...
it wasn't for you.
I always just felt better in the church.
but we got the contracts from Ronde's office.
you didn't leave your backup gig, like you told us.
you were fired about a week after Billy died.
that's why you dedicated your talents to the church.
you might have had the talent, but you didn't have the look.
you were only there in the first place 'cause of Billy. Without him, you were nothing.
in fact, you were always overlooked. By Ronde, then by Billy.
Billy never overlooked me.
lot of pressure on Billy--the church, the studio.
I'm sure trying to help you added to it.
good thing he had support from someone like Beatrice.
What?! Why? - Well, she loved him.
love?! Please. She didn't even know him.
paid for his headstone after he died.
she didn't pay for it. I...
kept hearing about this headstone. Wanted to see it for ourselves.
the Lord is good to all, and his tender mercies are on all his works.
psalm 145.
an ode to Billy.
your atonement. Now, how'd you pay for it, Chandra?
with the exact amount Billy had on him when he was killed?
the groundskeeper at the cemetery says you're there at least once a month.
I loved Billy.
ever since I was little, he was there for me.
Rush: And when Billy needed you, you were there for him, weren't you?
he called, said he needed a ride to the bus station.
you don't understand.
I couldn't lose him.
he was the only one who believed in me.
Ooh! Thought I'd have to walk the whole way. Owe you tons.
Oh, it's not a problem.
why you jumping to get to the bus station anyway?
got to get to Baltimore.
finally stood up to my old man, Chandra.
I'm gonna move out on my own. - Really?
and look. I told Rondeto kiss my ass, and he actually paid me.
shove it, Ronde.
but you're still gonna work for him, though, right?
What?! No. I'm going to do my own thing.
but you're the only one promoting me there.
you said we were gonna make a record together.
I believed you, Billy.
and we can someday - Someday? When?
without you around, I'm just a ghost.
you can't just leave.
I have to. I'm gonna go get Beatrice and bring her back here, so we can start a label.
Beatrice? - You know, it's because of her that I have the guts to do all this. - Because of her?
some a-assistant wants to leech off of you 'cause she knows you'll be something?!
no, it's not like that at all. She believes in me.
I believe in you.
she's pregnant. And I want to be with her.
this is something that I need to do.
no. We make... We make magic,
Billy. You know... You know what I can do.
you're the only one. - Chandra, calm down.
you said... - You said we were gonna make it...
calm down. - ...together.
it'll be okay. You're great. We'll make a record someday.
this is not about the record.
I'm sorry.
Donalyn? Can't wait to show you your new room.
Kenny painted it himself. Right？
Meesha, you're going to love your new school.
it has a swimming pool.
Yes!
we don't know how to swim.
well, you can learn.
right, Meesha? - Yes, Mrs. Watson.
you don't have to call us Mr. and Mrs. Watson anymore.
we're family now.
you can call us Alice Kenneth，or Mom and Dad.
we already got a mom and dad.
we're gonna set some rules.
curfew's 7: 00 on school nights, 8:00 on weekends.
those streetlights cut on, y'all in the house.
Hey, Meesha, look over there.
Donalyn, roll up your window.
Donalyn, do you hear me?
I don't want you hanging out with those people.
my 11-year-old daughter died last week.
brain aneurysm.
sorry about your loss.
that girl they found in the landfill back in '91-- Donalyn Sullivan.
Yeah.
I tell you what I did, can I get to go to my daughter's funeral?
depends on what you did.
I found her dead in the basement of my club.
when was this? - November 18th.
the morning after my 27th birthday party.
we were having some plumbing done.
might have got hit with one of them pipes.
Might've?
What'd you do with her body?
I wrapped it in this zebra rug I had.
put her in the Dumpster behind Checkers on 29th.
so you find a dead girl in your club-- you toss her body in a Dumpster instead of calling the cops?
I ran with the 26th Street Villains.
if they'd caught me talking to some cops, I would have gone to hell.
what's a 14-year-old girl doing there in the first place?
wild night. Could have snuck in.
now I know what her parents must have felt， losing a child.
I want to do what's right.
18 years too late.
funeral home's holding my daughter's body.
my wife is waiting for me.
you said it was your birthday party, right?
I'm gonna need names.
club was abandoned in '97.
the city's got ownership now.
hmm, your tax dollars at work.
the M.E.'s office confirmed Donalyn was hit with an object.
about one-inch round.
found a permit for a plumbing overhaul back in '91, Replaced lead pipes with galvanized.
Detectives,there's blood on the pipe.
let's cut section out. Perfectly good murder weapon.
I'm guessing Sticky didn't have a permit for that.
Donalyn Sullivan. 14-year-old, foster kid. Biological parents both dead.
she and her little sister Meesha moved in with Kenneth and Alice Watson on April '91.
fourth foster family in five years.
seven months later, she's dead in a landfill.
no recent rapes or regular pervs.
foster dad alibied out.
in Baltimore with a friend the night Donalyn went missing.
foster mom was at home with the younger sister.
Donalyn sneaks out, goes to Sticky's party.
next morning, foster mom files a missing persons.
it's three weeks before her body's discovered at the dump.
Hey, look who's back from the dead.
would of had a to-do with some notice.
I thought I'd be hanging with the zombies till retirement.
still don't know how you did it, boss.
still got some juice upstairs, I guess. Glad to have you back, Kat.
M. E.'s report.
piping in Sticky's basement fits the thread pattern on Donalyn's skull.
blood type's a match, too.
two items found on the victim.
picture of her biological mother and a busted audio tape.
I'll take it to the sound hounds. See if they can work their magic.
let's bring in the foster parents and the sister, see if Sticky's club jogs their memories.
you got it, boss.
Hey, Nick. - Hmm?
still waiting on that doctor's report from you.
thought that was more of an optional thing. - Only if you opt to wear the badge.
I haven't seen a doctor since 1980.
I don't even have one.
then find one.
I don't believe it. ... Donalyn wasn't the type of girl to go clubbin'.
more of a homebody?
just wasn't all that social.
she spent most of her time watching her sister.
got a guest list from Sticky's club that night.
recognize any names?
maybe friends of Donalyn's
if she had friends, I didn't know any of them.
told the girls to stay away from those kids on 26th.
you mean the kids at school?
these kids couldn't spell "school."
told cops back in '91 you were in Baltimore night Donalyn disappeared.
with my pal, James McDonald. Fishing.
you still got his number?
somewhere. - When'd you come back home?
as soon as Alice called, said Donalyn was missing.
she ever run away before? - Not that I know of.
but Donalyn was a teenager. Had a mind of her own.
she give Alice trouble?
told Alice, those girls didn't need sympathy, they needed discipline.
you ever discipline them, Kenneth?
Alice got mad if I raised my voice.
didn't let me smoke anymore. Had all kind of rules.
how was your relationship with Donalyn?
I always woark outside.
did what I could when I was around.
I took her to see Phantom of the Opera in New York once.
she liked that.
you and Alice divorced in '92?
losing a child like that-- it just ripped us apart.
so Ken being away, two foster kids, it must have been rough.
life of a trucker's wife.
might as well have been a single mother.
you and Donalyn get along?
tried to create a family for her.
girl was mad at the world.
her mother was a addict. Died of AIDS.
no father.
a tough life for a kid.
I was a first-time foster mom.
thought I could change the world.
but what they say is true.
it's harder with the older ones.
Meesh, I'm Queen Latifah.
no, don't stop.
what does she want? - Come on, you guys, keep going.
I got homework.
Hey, Donalyn, what do you say tomorrow we have a girls' day?
maybe... we could go shopping, get our nails done?
whatever you want.
please, Donalyn?
what do you say?
give me a chance?
maybe?
I'll do it for the drama queen.
okay.
I took what I could get.
so Donalyn was close with her younger sister?
best friends. - Is that Meesha?
Yes.
convinced DHS to let her live with me after Donalyn died.
adopted her in '95.
she's a doctor at Children's now.
you're reopening my sister's case?
after all this time? I don't understand.
got a new lead. You ever hear of Sticky's on 26th?
club was owned by Virgil "Sticky" Jones.
Yeah.
she'd sneak up there whenever she could.
is that where she was killed?
I thought she ran away.
you, uh, recognize any of these names?
how'd she get out of the house?
just went out the back door.
you never tell your parents about Donalyn's night life?
I wanted a family, Donalyn didn't.
after she left-- after I thought she left-- all I had was my mother.
what about Kenneth?
never saw him after they divorced.
he was never much around, anyway.
wait, Zen.
I remember him.
friend of Donalyn's?
I wouldn't go that far.
we met him the first week in the neighborhood.
he messed with the wrong new girl.
you funny, right?
this is my street, bitch.
26... we never forget.
I see you again... gonna earn my bones.
come on, Meesh.
I always thought she was fearless, but she was just a little girl.
zen was a 26th Street Villain?
heard he shot a guy for his Jordans.
happen to know his real name?
Yeah, I think Zeb Edwards.
Thanks, Meesha.
you'll let me know if you find anything, right?
all right.
so, Zeb and Sticky were 26ers. - Maybe Zeb ran into Donalyn at the birthday party.
got back at her over that "little issue" of his.
just Zeb now. - Zeb Edwards.
popped in '92 for ag assault,'93 criminal conspiracy,'94 possession with intent.
people say this and that.
but 26ers never forget-- what you told Donalyn Sullivan after she outspit you on 26th.
come on, I changed.
look, I'm a family man now.
were you at Sticky's birthday party in '91?
Nah, it wasn't me.
why were you on the guest list, Zen?
start talkin' straight, or I take out the bracelets.
what you wanna know?
the night Donalyn was killed, you two still beefin'?
Nah, me and Sugar Dawn, we was friends by then. - Sugar Dawn?
Yeah, it's the name I gave her.
what kind of friendship you have with a 14-year-old girl?
Nah, it wasn't like that. I was her manager.
Yeah, turned her into a bona fide MC.
back then, you either was a talent ,or you found the talent.
all right, look, you wanna do this, you gotta look the part, all right?
here, put this...Damn!
not like I'm gonna hit you.
I can do it myself.
all right, where the earrings and the ring I got you?
you gotta put 'em on.
put your rings on.
put the hat on.
cool?
Ah, now there she go. That's Sugar Dawn.
Zen, get the little girl outta here.
yo, she's dope, man. She got mad skills.
Hey, you was on 26th ，and first day me and my sister moved over there.
yo, Sugar Dawn, go ahead ，and make a quick start.
Yeah, yeah. I got it.
I'm tellin' you, man, she's gonna be the next Antoinette.
she just another girl on 26th thinks she can rap.
I know I can rap.
all right, you can stay.
man, the only reason why y'all lovin' her is 'cause she's still in diapers.
she a baby MC.
I mean, she look like me, y'all got her rappin' like me, but she ain't me.
Oh, I don't know. I think she got you there, Big Soph.
who, her?
man, get your finger out my face. - I know that's not what just happened!
I know you didn't just disrespect me like that!
you know, you getter watch your back!
don't let me catch your ass on 26th, cause I got you!
I should've protected Sugar Dawn more.
big Soph was crazy.
she at Sticky's party that night?
Yeah, she got a big recording contract.
sugar Dawn was supposed to spit for a contract, too, but she never showed.
Yeah. Yeah, it was the night the Phillies ended the game on that triple play.
you remember who was workin' the parking lot?
last name Parker?
he'll be back Saturday?
all right, thanks.
so, any luck with the foster father's alibi?
number Ken gave us for James McDonald was disconnected back in '97.
ran down the forwarding number. There's no answer.
uh, where's mine?
I thought you gave up the cow.
I'm gone a couple weeks and all of a sudden I'm vegetarian?
A/V department was able to save part of Donalyn's audiotape.
listen. - Different foster homes But don't none of them care
and I hate to see my sister cry, 'cause that ain't fair She's too young to understand how we ended up here.
so I promise that'll change every single new year.
A/V's trying to rescue the rest of the tape.
and I've been harassing DHS to open Donalyn's file.
know a gal over there. I'll, uh, reach out.
pretty heavy lyrics for a 14-year-old.
Veronica's around Donalyn's age.
I can't imagine her going through any of this.
Thanks, Scotty.
we got the big guns.
the lieutenant and the lady detective.
deserve special treatment, being the voice of Philly Hip-Hop on Radio 99.
and I'm on in 45.
looks like you're gonna miss drive time, Big Soph.
police harassin' another person of color's no big surprise.
Ah, a couple of Philly cops don't scare you.
especially since you're so good with a razor blade.
served three years at Muncy for assault.
bitch had it comin'.
you call me in for somethin' that happened a hundred years ago?
remember Donalyn Sullivan?
maybe you know her as Sugar Dawn?
Yeah, I remember Sugar Dawn.
Yeah, me... me and Baby MC, we was cool.
you ever threaten her?
she was a kid. - Didn't tell her to watch her back?
heat of the moment, maybe.
you got signed with Killadelphia Entertainment in '91.
did.
what's your point?
you got your big break at Sticky's on 26th.
at his birthday party. So?
same night and place Sugar Dawn was murdered.
see where we're going now?
like I said, I didn't see her.
Donalyn was there to audition that night, too.
she's dead, you're famous. Do the math.
look, Sugar Dawn was on 26th with the big dogs, but she was still wet behind the ears.
I tried to help!
Oh, you like rap music?
Hey, man...
yo, Baby MC, come here.
for real, come here. I ain't gonna do nothin', all right?
how much you sellin' your tapes for?
ten dollars.
you buggin', right?
zen didn't tell me how much.
all right, check this.
look at homeboy over there in the fake Karl Kani's.
you ask him for ten, he gonna shut you down.
that's a five-dolla' brotha'.
so you only charge people what you think they'll pay, see?
and another thing, you want to take all this off.
all what off?
all that jewelry, unless you trying to get jacked out here, trying to look like Big Soph and all.
come on.
you still in diapers, so make it work.
never ask more than $15, all right?
go do it. Go on. Go ahead.
Hey, man, you like hip-hop?
told you!
Where's my money?
what money? - From your studio time.
zen said he'd front it. - Well, he didn't.
Huxtable, she's just a kid.
is anybody talking to you?
got $20.
I could page Zen and see if he can bring some more.
no, we're gonna find him together.
get in the damn car!
Huxtable was serious about his paper.
that was the last time I saw Sugar Dawn.
when was that?
two days before Sticky's party.
that thing we talked about.
happy anniversary.
some guys bring flowers.
a dozen roses ain't got nothing on six hollow points.
you know I already got a piece.
Yeah, but yours comes with too many questions attached.
Still,think I could take it back? Get some diamond studs?
real ones?
no refunds, no exchanges.
also, completely untraceable. - Seriously, Eddie.
look, you asked me what I'd do in your situation. A guy like that?
well... Just be careful.
you been under too long.
maybe things start looking kind of cloudy, huh?
couldn't be clearer from where I'm standing.
scum out there wants you dead.
I'm just evening the odds. - Look, I told you before.
I don't need protecting.
well, the beauty of a thing like this?
you can put it away. Forget about it.
unless the time comes when you need it.
then you decide where you stand. - I already know where I stand.
I'm just looking out, okay?
diamonds, huh?
wait.
let me think about it.
okay?
Huxtable, huh?
whatever happened to good old street names like Chicken Legs and Fat Head?
who's asking?
what can I do for you, detectives?
mortuary playlist his idea or yours?
keeps the mind active.
family business here is a long way away from that one-bedroom music studio you used to run.
I'm still in the scene. I find underground talent.
post their songs on my blog.
you know a Donalyn Sullivan?
sure. She was a friend of mine.
remember her taking a ride in your Cherokee? November '91? Just you and her?
what are you getting at? - Is that a yes?
look, she was a little girl.
got an eyewitness, saw you throw that little girl in your Cherokee, take off down Broad Street.
okay, the whole neighborhood knew my family owned this mortuary.
they knew I had money. Had to show them I was hard.
Jack and Jill kid looking for some street cred.
LD Haed to play the game. We both did.
what were you doing at Broad Street, anyway? You know it's dangerous this time of night.
what do you care where I'm at?
everybody's not out to take something from you, little sister.
well, you want your money, so there. That's all I got.
zen shouldn't have you out there.
I can take care of myself. - I got something for you.
back seat.
James Baldwin. Go Tell It on the Mountain.
I already read it. - I don't doubt it.
I knew you were different.
don't need Zen turning you into one of Big Soph's clones.
shit, she ain't got nothing on me. - Your single sucks.
did you write it?
Zen. - That figures. It's trivial.
trivial sells.
how many tapes you sold today?
you got more inside you. Spit about something real. Not some clich ghetto, nursery rhyme.
Oh, like you, college boy?
fronting like your mommy and daddy ain't paying for your apartment on Chestnut.
but I don't have what you got.
you're more than just another MC, Donalyn.
everybody's got dreams. Don't mean nothin'.
the difference is, you got talent.
and you're smart.
how old are you?
14 and a half.
and a half.
what's that mean?
maybe you should just be 14.
let the half take care of itself. - Yeah.
Yeah. - Maybe.
Hey, can you pull over at that pay phone for a minute?
Yeah. Um...
I guess I got through to her. Cost her her life, though.
who'd Donalyn call?
Zen. She fired him right there.
how'd he take that?
he was a 26er.
so, how do you think he took it?
my father and I prepared her for burial.
I hardly recognized her.
said you turned Sugar Dawn into a bona fide MC.
before me, she was just another girl roasting on 26th.
but Sugar Dawn was looking to change her image.
but she never told me.
but she wanted to rap about more than cars and jewelry.
she'd rap about a dog if I told her.
sugar Dawn dropped you, Zen. - Please.
I put her on the map.
well, the neighborhood map.
but she wanted more. 14 and she already outgrew you.
a 26er like you wasn't just gonna take that.
told you, I had nothing to do with what happened to Sugar Dawn.
y'all just be wanting to have the brothers all gripped up.
you'll be gripping 20 years in Graterford, you don't drop that attitude and come clean.
okay.
she fired me, all right?
but that lasted about half a second.
we on 10：50 A. M!
I know it's only a indie station, but it's something.
skills of an MC boss...
I ain't never been soft, I'm goin' off.
go, go, go, go, go, go... Yo, we on the radio!
all right, so look. Sticky's birthday party is tomorrow night, right?
everybody's gonna be there.
now one of Sticky's boys promised me a one-on-one with Killadelphia Entertainment.
you do "Goin' Off."
I don't want to do "Goin' Off."
what you talking about? That's your single.
I'm saying I want to do one of my own songs, Zen.
spit about something real. - Aw, you playin', D,right?
come on, man, you're killing me. - I'm serious.
Oh, what, you on some old Negro spiritual now from Huxtable?
man, people don't dance to that.
maybe I just want them to listen.
what do you know about life?
nothing.
the room was pitch black when the chandelier fell the first time he reached out,
I remember it well, whispered lies in my ear, 'cause he told me he cared I saw a different kind of Phantom ,in the way that he stared.
what Phantom?
still my face can't reveal what I'm feeling inside
but you can see it if you look into my eyes Read between the lines.
what are you talking about, D?
I do my song or I'm out.
that's what I'm talking about.
girl blew me away with that song.
do you know who she was talking about?
only heard the first verse.
next night at Sticky's party, I waited for her backstage.
she never showed. - Anyone verify that?
I got some names.
she was like a little sister to me, man.
if I'd have known she was in trouble, I would have done anything to protect her.
you need to do what you need to do. I'm going to put you on blast, okay?
I...I wasn't expecting you.
I got to work late.
just wanted to drop by.
everything copacetic?
sit down.
we about to have "the talk"?
uh, this thing that you did the other night.
the gift I gave you?
you didn't have to. - No. I wanted to.
I'm saying, I like you either way.
I don't need any grand gestures.
okay.
whatever my problems are, they're mine.
I hear what you're saying.
you want me to back off.
I just need some room to maneuver.
if that's what you want, that's what you get.
thank you.
now, that thing... from the other night... - Yeah, I threw it in the Schuylkill.
well, no harm, no foul.
got to do it the right way. - Just got to do it my way.
just got off the horn with James McDonald, foster dad's alibi.
finally grew a conscience, admitted that Kenny Watson's lying.
he wasn't fishing in '91. - So, where was he?
he was with his girlfriend Lisa Jackson up in D. C.
met her when she was 15.
A/V finally salvaged the rest of Donalyn's tape.
got the other verses to her song.
she called Ken "the Phantom."
guess he'd turned his eye on her.
he sees it, too,Now he's telling me to run away.
but I got Baby girl with me. Where we gonna stay?
alibi's not the only thing Kenneth lied about.
Mr. Watson?
detectives?
need to ask you some questions.
let me take the chains off.
Mr. Watson? - Mr. Watson, you got to open that door right now.
perv knew we were on to him, boss.
ate his gun before we could get him. - Took the easy way out.
should've killed himself in '91. Saved us the hassle.
any proof he was molesting Donalyn?
jailbait magazines all over the place.
Donalyn rapped about a Phantom on her audio tape.
think she was talking about Kenneth.
guy was a predator. Killed her to cover it up.
we're gonna need more than that. Let's bring in Alice.
pick up Meesha, too. Find out what was really going on in that house.
these are Donalyn's DHS records.
says she lived with a family called the Martins for a month, but not you?
it was the only time we were separated.
she hated it there.
not the whole story, Meesha.
another girl reported she was abused there.
said Donalyn was, too.
she never told me.
she never told anyone.
she ever talk about a "Phantom"?
something she made up to scare me.
lock your doors， so the Phantom doesn't come." You know, kid stuff.
Ken took Donalyn to see Phantomof the Opera, though.
right?
what are you telling me?
not me, your sister.
but lately it's been getting harder just to pretend .'Cause once again I see the Phantom when I see him He sees it, too, now he's telling me to run away, but I got Babygirl with me, where we gonna stay?
I remember that song... 
I wasn't tryin' to hurt you. - Of course you were.
he sees it, too, now he's telling me to run away ,but I got Babygirl with me, where we gonna stay?
what's that supposed to mean, huh?
look at me, Donalyn.
after all we've done for you.
man, he wants me outta here.
he told me to beat it before something bad happened.
he didn't say that. - I've seen that look before. I know what comes next.
you don't know what you're talking about. - Think I'm some kinda little kid?
you're 14.
you don't know what I've been through.
and I'm not about to let it happen again to me or my little sister.
let what happen again?
you say you love us, right?
Donalyn, please.
I'm trying here.
Kenny's trying.
Meesha's trying. Everybody's trying, but you.
Oh, God.
where are you going? - I'm outta here.
Donalyn, wait! Don't go!
just...
all this time... I thought Donalyn abandoned me.
she was just trying to save me.
you see Donalyn after that?
no.
that was the last time I saw my big sister.
what about Alice?
she said she stayed home all night with you. That true?
you divorced in '92.
irreconcilable differences.
I'll bet it was a challenge when you found out about Kenneth'stendencies.
there's no reconciling those, right?
I don't know what you're talking about.
you're protecting him? Even now?
Kenny was a decent man. Hard worker, a good provider.
no, he was a predator.
he knew we had his number. There's a reason he offed himself.
that's between him and God.
he can't hurt you anymore, Alice.
can't hurt you or the girls.
tell us what happened.
you'll feel better, I promise.
he followed her to the club.
to Sticky's?
I told him what she said.
about taking Meesha away.
he was supposed to talk some sense into her.
but she wouldn't listen?
no.
said he hit her over the head with a pipe.
he told me he killed her.
it's a gripping story... Alice.
what?
he couldn't have been at the club 'cause he was in Maryland.
look it. Had a room at the Bethesda Inn with his 17-year-old girlfriend.
Seventeen...?
no. No, he-he came back home.
he went after her. He told me.
the only person who'd know Donalyn was beat with a pipe was the one did the beatin'-- that's you.
it's over, Alice.
she was gonna take Meesha away.
I couldn't let them go.
you took Kenneth's side.
no. No, God help me, no. I kicked Kenneth out.
I wasn't... I wasn't going to let him near Meesha!
please... tell Meesha I'm sorry.
Hey, Donalyn...
what are you doing here?
we need to talk.
come on.
I know you're angry, Donalyn, but you can't just keep running and dragging this little girl behind you.
I've been taking care of Meesha all her life.
families talk.
they stick it out.
well, we ain't your family.
but you could be.
you said it yourself, nothing happened.
we're leaving tomorrow.
please, don't do this to Meesha.
all you talk about is Meesha!
you don't care nothing about me!
who do you think I'm talking about now?
you, Donalyn. Don't you want to be happy?
Hey, I'm not gonna pretend no more.
I'm going out there tonight. I'm gonna get me a contract.
then you're never gonna see us again.
you can't sing that song! I won't let you take her away!
you're just a child!
old enough to call our social worker.
tell her everything! Then you'll never get any more kids!
shut your mouth! - I won't let you do that! You're not taking her!
Oh, no! Donalyn?
Oh, God!
No! Oh, no! I'm sorry! Oh, God, I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.
Whassup, Philly? It's your girl, Big Soph, voice of Philly Hip-Hop Radio 99 FM.
gonna take you back to the '90s.
Yeah, you know how we do it.
authentic hip-hop.
gonna play you a new joint by former street MC Donalyn Sullivan, called Read Between the Lines.
she was murdered back in '91.
shout out to 26th and Sergeant.
she's one of our own.
this one's for us.
july
lines got to be strong, you see?
no time to think. Just let it happen.
paint's like your blood, telling the whole world you've been up here.
you all right, little man?
come on, man.
I can't move, Carlos.
just got to stop looking down. Look up.
look, you can do it. Come on.
I got you.
when it's darkest, men see stars.
aren't no stars, Leon.
not in my universe anyway.
no stars? What do you mean?
ma kicked me out. I tell you that?
like I don't even exist.
ain't nobody bombing like Blaze.
take a picture.
by the time I'm done, the whole city's gonna know my name.
Oct.82
what, are you taking a trip?
no. A friend bought a condo in Boca.
thinking of investing myself.
looks quiet. It's probably a good place to write.
what's that supposed to mean?
didn't Hemingway live in Florida?
I need to talk to someone about my son's murder.
well, I'm detective Lilly Rush.
my partner, Scotty Valens.
what was your son's name?
killed October 11, 1982.
someone sprayed paint in his mouth till he suffocated.
I, uh, put his things in storage.
last week, motel where I work in cut my hours.
can't afford the storage anymore?
like most, can't afford much of anything.
when I was cleaning it out, I found this in his backpack.
Philly
Yeah, seen these back in Narc.
it's a graffiti writer's black book.
it's why I need to talk to you.
I told the police back then my son was nothing but a huffer.
he was sniffing paint?
well, I'd catch him huddled up with a paper bag and paint cans, stealing money out of my purse...
he never talked about graffiti?
we hardly saw each other.
I had to work three jobs just to keep a roof over our heads.
you thought he was an addict.
so I kicked him out.
but he was an artist, wasn't he?
you ever see Carlos after he left the house?
he'd sneak in after I left for work, raid the fridge.
left his backpack once.
next day, they told me he was dead.
look at this one.
it was October 11, 1982.
that's the day Carlos died, right?
it looks like part of a bigger piece, but there's no other pictures.
you know where this photo was taken?
I wish. Like to see it myself.
you know who Carlos was hanging out with
other taggers, uh, friends?
no idea.
mistake I made, kicking him out of the house.
something here.
Carlos bombed over someone else's work.
anarchy?
some kind of insult?
that's a declaration of war.
hard-core punks in that world?
no way they're letting him get away with it.
well, maybe NRKE got even, dropped a bomb on Carlos.
Carlos Espinosa. 16 years old.
body was found in an alley in Kensington on October 11, 1982.
autopsy report indicates a skull fracture.
M. E. found chips of paint in the gash on Carlos's head.
cause of death was asphyxiation.
someone bashed his head against the wall before that paint was forced down his throat.
assigned figured another huffer jumped Carlos, used his own can of paint against him.
murder weapon found under some debris
couldn't lift a print.
well, see if you can trace the can, locate the retailer.
victim had three healed broken ribs at the time of his death.
well, mom kicked him out, and Carlos was living on the streets.
lot of ways for a kid to get hurt out there.
any idea where he racked his supplies?
well, mom said she found receipts in his jean pockets
uh, small stuff like gum.
that's an old trick. Pay for something cheap so no one's suspicious, then shoplift the paint.
well, the receipts were from a Harold's Hardware.
I'll show them a photo, see if maybe someone remembers Carlos.
had a steady hand. Clean lines.
looked into NRKE.
the crew was notorious in the 80s for violent street justice.
so, Carlos was killed in their hood?
Yeah, two blocks from their clubhouse. - Well, we're going to need names.
I'm meeting with the head of the Graffiti Removal Commission, uh, Don Bardwill. Been on the scene three decades.
says he knew NRKE up close and personal.
Curtis, hey. Uh, I was wondering...
yeah?
... how you and your ex agreed on custody.
that's what you were wondering?
well, I wouldn't say that me and the soul crusher agreed on anything.
so, you petioned for visitation?
wait. What's going on, Kat?
Jarrod sent me a letter.
he got married, moved back to Philly.
he wants Veronica to stay with him two weekends a month.
what are my options?
well, you could play hardball, force him to file a custody complaint.
would Veronica have to testify?
strong possibility.
what else? - I don't know. Sit down with the guy.
there's probably a way to work it out.
how do you work it out with an ex-banger who wants custody of your kid?
I could come. Uh, not as a lawyer.
you know, just as your boyfriend.
Yeah, okay. - Yeah.
but...
never said you were my boyfriend.
I'll see you... later.
Oh, hey, lover boy.
we need to talk. - So talk.
in private.
got something to show you.
so... uh...
here, give me a hand, will you? We-we're looking for a, um...
private criminal complaint.
filed by Moe Kitchener. - That's it. Against one Lillian Rush.
let's see.
you put a boot on his car.
harassed his loan officer.
gave him a night in the drunk tank with...
Tico? - Yeah.
he forget anything? - It's not the first complaint he's ever filed.
Yeah, but this one's from the DA's Office, Lil, not IAB.
these guys can prosecute you for a crime.
Thanks. Got it.
I don't know what's going on with you, but...
this could cost you your career.
you done talking yet?
Hey, you're on your own.
always have been.
called me the Graffiti Gestapo back in the day. - Colorful name.
cruised around in my Mercury Monarch with a gallon of paint, removers.
people say these kids are vandals, crooks.
wonder why.
just neglected kids trying to show the world they exist.
painting murals gives them an outlet.
beautifies the city in the process.
Yeah, you got that list we asked for?
NRKE, right? It's here somewhere.
turbo 102. This look like the same tag?
judging by the way the T's slanted, I'd say it's him all right.
who is he? - Good question.
Guasy's been bombing the city almost three decades.
are you saying he still hits places today?
most bombers leave churches and cemeteries alone.
Turbo's got no respect for anything or anyone.
do you know where this photo was taken?
too small to make out any landmarks. Where'd you get it?
kid we're looking into, Carlos Espinosa.
this was his black book. Went by Blaze.
Oh, I know that tag.
you didn't mention Blaze on the phone.
is that why you asked about NRKE?
why, is there a connect?
blaze was new on the scene.
NRKE taught him a serious lesson.
what the hell you doing, hermano?
just trying to get my name on the map.
you got to dis to get noticed.
nobody bombs here without going through me.
this is NRKE's wall.
fool, I am NRKE.
this is pretty.
it's better than what was up there. Yeah.
who is this kid?
you think you got style?
this is my block. I'm the king.
you'd better get somebody else to do your writing, man.
you're cocky for somebody who's about to get his ass beat.
turn him over.
I catch you capping my spot again, I'm gonna feed you this can.
Hey, get out of here, narc, or you're next.
it's what happens when you leave a bunch of kids on their own.
you call the cops?
drove straight to a pay phone.
by the time they got there everyone was gone
including Blaze.
explains the broken ribs.
what about the thug? Head of NRKE?
called himself Tut.
one thing I know:
nobody disrespected the King.
Philly's finest looking for a new paint job?
shop's a step up from tagging with NRKE.
NRKE. Haven't heard that name in a while.
understand you were the King.
took it pretty serious.
thought I was bombing the system, leaving my mark.
just a bunch of hoodlums running on the streets.
investigating the murder of Carlos Espinosa.
went by the tag of BLAZE back in 82.
not a bad throw up.
Prolly would've messed him up real good if I would've caught him.
got a witness says you were doing exactly that.
gonna feed you this can. Sound familiar?
look, uh, back in the day, thought the only thing you had in this world was your name, your reputation.
well, toy like Carlos disses you, you gotta show him you mean business, right?
Mm-hmm. But the boy came around a few weeks later, tail between his legs, and the King granted him a pardon.
believe this?
fool's stupider than I thought.
I want to g-go.
come on, Leon. You got my back, right?
bring us a punching bag, hombre?
it's cool, Leon. I got this.
drank too much, disrespected you and your whole crew.
hell, everybody knows the King's tearing it up all over.
I got a peace offering.
next time, bring better beer.
come here.
I saw your tag up on the Alleghany water tower.
going higher next time.
you got a lot of sack, climbing up there.
fall off a roof, go to heaven.
highest spot of all.
say, man, toy like you needs a crew.
a place to crash.
throw slo-mo here some scraps.
you all planning any pieces? Burners?
come on, man, this is NRKE.
all-out destruction, man.
you know what I'm saying?
you want pretty pieces, you going to yourself a graffiti coloring book.
all right. Let me think about it.
what's there to think about?
NRKE reigns supreme, nobody comes close.
can we g-go now?
Yeah, man. Just-just give me a minute.
be careful, man. That chick's dangerous.
Hey. I'm Carlos.
not anymore.
now...
you're mine.
thought he was gonna join the crew, make me look good.
and he turned you down?
can you believe it? Thought I was giving him the keys to the castle.
now, who was the kid with Carlos?
never knew his name. - What about the girl?
uh... Gina something.
always writing with that nasty orange.
she part of your crew? - She wanted to be.
told her she had a sloppy hand with no style.
you know how she got her tag, Talon?
heard she, uh, clawed out some guy's eyes.
tried to warn Carlos, but once she got it in you, she ain't never letting go.
yeah?
Carlos's last piece.
ID put it under a complex magnifier.
get anything? - The wall has oval-shaped bricks.
there's one place in town with those bricks: the sewer system.
tagger's MO is to get his name up where everyone can see it. Why go underground?
the last piece he ever drew.
chance it could shed some light.
lot of sewers, boss.
distribute a flyer with Carlos's photo and a Polaroid of his last piece.
pwd workers, homeless shelters.
maybe we get lucky.
I tracked down the owner of Harold's.
said Carlos was seeing one of his employees.
Yeah, fired her once he realized she was stealing all the spray paint.
you show her photo to "King Tut"?
ID'd her as Talon. Will's tracking her down now.
Talon, huh?
well, it's time we stick our claws in her.
so, you, um...
moved from Detroit?
last month. Yeah, finally got settled. Unpacked the last box.
and got the girls enrolled in school.
I have two daughters, Connie and Cassie.
we got a place with a bedroom for Veronica, too.
painted it her favorite color. - Purple.
lavender, baby. - Right, lavender.
cause apparently there's a difference.
sorry. I gotta go.
Dame. - Ah, gracias.
your mother, she gets more beautiful every day.
he does that to get out of doing the dishes.
think I don't know your tricks, viejo?
how's your knee, Ma?
mm, doctor said it's fine.
so, you going to grace us with your presence on Sunday?
I'm making arroz con gandules.
Valens. - Hey. Pierson.
got another purse snatching outside the Dayley's Market.
same MO. Older Hispanic lady.
taking her statement now.
uh... hold her till I get there.
- Yeah.
I'm sorry, Ma, I gotta... take this. It's work.
it's always work with you, Scotty.
when you gonna slow down?
Sunday. Arroz con gandules.
sorry, we're closed.
what can I do for you?
nice stuff for a girl from the streets.
graffiti vandal turned boutique owner.
graffiti taught me skills.
how to market my name, resilience, respect. What's this about?
know where this was taken?
never seen it before.
ever go to the sewer to tag? - Why would I do that?
to hang with your boyfriend, Carlos Espinosa.
Carlos wasn't my boyfriend.
you stealing all that paint from Harold's Hardware just for yourself?
I did a lot of crazy things when I was a teenager.
racking paint for a boy I liked was just one of 'em.
crazy is a good way to put it.
arrested three times for vandalism.
one for aggressive assault.
the assault was self-defense.
not the way the judge saw it.
my stepfather used to beat me.
one day he got the idea to toss me out a third-floor window.
clawed his eyes out to stop him.
fluorescent orange is still your signature color.
I like orange. Is that a crime?
no.
but this is...
heard he was killed.
I didn't know it was like this.
Carlos thought no one could touch him.
he was wrong.
come here, I want to show something.
blaze and Talon.
it looks alive.
I've never seen anything like it.
your name should be up high.
I see you.
toe to toe Yeah, who told you to look?
why don't you just write your last name up there, too, Leon?
use the name I gave you. Turbo.
the fastest tagger in town.
so, what's with you and speed bump?
don't say things like that, all right?
he might start believing it.
sorry.
he's got a raw deal, that's all.
pretty decent of you, letting him tag along.
everybody needs someone, right?
get down! Get down! - What's wrong?
got some cop after me.
he always knows where I'm at. I don't know how.
he chased me down an alley with a flashlight, said he was gonna bash my head in.
what for? - I don't know. Guy's obsessed.
he's always buffing out my tags.
I catch you, you're dead, Blaze!
that-that's him! Run!
Carlos was different.
always taking care of other people.
this is the guy who was chasing Carlos?
could be. - Carlos's friend, Leon
you're saying he was Turbo?
that's what Carlos called him.
said he found him in an alley, eating out of the trash.
where can we find him?
six feet under. He fell off a roof a week before Carlos died.
thank you.
we'll be in touch.
so, if Turbo's dead, who's using the tag Turbo 102?
I bet Don Bardwill knows.
Hi. Detective Valens.
uh, thanks for waiting, Belen.
your case is similar to another case I'm working.
Yeah, I-I already told that other young man everything.
sorry to put you through this again.
can you tell me what happened, por favor?
hoodlum came out of nowhere, pushed me down.
ran off with my pocketbook.
you get hurt?
scratched my knee.
I'm fine.
did you get a look at the guy?
my eyes aren't so good anymore.
what was he, white, black, Latino?
all my groceries are in the trunk.
my ice cream's melting.
help me get this guy off the street.
stop him from doing this again.
I have to go. - Belen...
there are other women he's done this to.
women like you.
you've spoken to them?
I...
I know... what he did to you.
I wasn't strong enough to stop him.
I tried to scream, but he put his hand over my mouth.
he... put his hand over your mouth?
my husband is the only man I've ever been with.
he told me to stop looking at him.
that was the only thing he said to me.
you...
you saw him?
Oh, yes.
things we gotta do...
get a nurse to see you...
uh, uh, I don't know, no.
look, anyone that cares for you...
they're gonna understand...
it wasn't your fault.
I shouldn't have been there.
it wasn't your fault.
you hear me, Belen, hmm?
I have to go.
my ice cream's melting.
graffiti Gestapo.
you get that nickname for getting physical with bombers like Carlos?
course not. I was trying to clean up the streets, not take on gangs.
clean up the streets.
that include chasing kids with your flashlight?
threatening to beat them?
might have tried to scare some punks.
you ask me, degenerates had it coming.
someone's got to step up and do something about it. Right?
I was taking back our city. What, by stalking Carlos? Hunting him down?
hey now, I never stalked anyone.
so how'd you always know where he was at?
I got calls when kids were bombing.
told me where to go.
always the same voice.
you saying someone was ratting out bombers?
don't know who it was. Didn't care.
made my job easier.
what about Leon? Chasing these kids around town.
you finally catch one?
don't know any Leon.
Oh, Carlos's little friend.
took a nosedive 13 stories off a roof a week before Carlos was murdered.
sorry to hear that, but like I said, don't know anyone named Leon.
want to tell me why your name's on his accident report, then?
says here that you were a witness to his death.
the date's October 2.
Ten-two. One-oh-two. Sound familiar?
give you a clue. Leon's nickname was Turbo.
One-oh-two-- the day he died.
now, you got photos of his tags all over your office.
you know every single place that he hit.
so tell us. Who's Turbo, Don?
I don't know.
I just wanted them to stop.
I didn't think it would go that far.
when it's darkest, men see stars.
don't be scared, Turbo.
this spot's gonna make the angels weep.
I w-want to see s-stars, Carlos.
you want stars? - Yeah.
you got stars. Let me see that first.
when
Emerson? Now who's that?
you said there weren't any stars. That's what you said. Remember?
did say that, but I was wrong. All right.
check this out.
freeze, you maggots! - Oh, somebody narced us out!
come on! Come on! Come on! Let's go!
come on, killer. Come on, let's go!
come on, Turbo!
you can do it!
get you, you little bastard!
help! Carlos! - I got you, man.
Carlos! Help! - I got you, man. I got you.
get out of here!
I'll tell them it was just me.
go before the cops come!
go!
night...
changed my life.
can't fix what happened.
but I've tried to do some good.
if Carlos was alive today, I'm sure...
he'd be doing exactly what I'm doing
giving these kids some hope.
what the hell was that, Kat?
I'm trying to help you out here.
I'm-I'm sorry.
I... I couldn't take it.
well, that much I got.
look, if Jarrod wants to see Veronica, he's gonna have to go to court.
okay, I'm-I'm gonna have to warn you.
his-his lawyer's gonna present a guy who's been clean for five years.
I leave you alone at the table, and now you're defending him?
I'm just saying how it's gonna look in court.
look, judges try to give parents contact with their children.
no, this is different, Curtis.
he's an ex-banger. You're not.
he's still her father.
not everyone deserves a second chance.
I'm sorry you feel that way.
in my book, guy should be able to see his own kid.
ma'am?
there a problem, lady? - No.
got to move the car.
tracked the orange paint can that Carlos was killed with.
manufacturer sold it to Harold's Hardware.
store where Gina worked.
excuse me.
I'm Eddie Clark.
work at the Fairhill soup kitchen.
saw one of your posters. I know this boy.
was there when he painted this piece.
don't hardly do it justice, though.
beautiful, ain't it? Just like I told you.
spent a lot of time down here back then.
man, where...
where did you learn how to do that?
the streets.
must be some damn angels on the street you come from, 'cause I ain't never seen nothing like that.
got us an artist in the sewer.
ain't an artist.
you tell that to them.
what you...? What you call it?
when it's darkest, men see stars.
that's what my friend always wanted.
you got a gift, brother.
a real gift.
you could do something with that.
what are they doing?
maybe they want to see stars, too.
still come down from time to time to look at those stars.
remind myself how far I've come.
you recognize those stars from Gina's clothing line?
Yeah. Our famous designer said she'd never seen this mural.
dead on site. Talon.
what kind of girlfriend leaves a message like that?
recognize this, Gina?
so I capped his burner. Doesn't mean I hurt him.
you want to read that for us?
dead on site. It was just an empty threat.
you two have an argument?
almost 30 years ago?
you can't expect me to remember ancient history.
you've been pawning Carlos' stars off as your own for nearly that long.
he wasn't the type to care if somebody was biting his work.
orange paint can that killed Carlos was sold at Harold's Hardware.
it's not like you think.
I was all alone.
I need his help...
but he wouldn't do it.
Carlos, there you are.
I've been looking for you.
a junkie jumped me in the park.
I need someone to watch my back. I couldn't find you.
leon died.
he fell.
it's my fault he was up there in the first place.
the streets aren't safe.
that's why we need a crew.
look.
it's the most I ever racked from Harold.
now we've got something to offer NRKE.
what do you want with those thugs?
they've got a clubhouse, a place to stay at night.
think they'll let you in their crew?
they will if you take me.
tut said you can join them.
you don't get it. They're bombing 'cause they're punks.
I'm done with that.
all right, I don't care about getting my name up.
I want to do something.
help people.
in the sewer?
nobody's going to see your work down here.
they already have.
look, I want to do something with this, Gina.
you could, too, if you'd just... - Bombers are getting clipped left and right.
NRKE is the only crew whose tags don't get taken down.
right. You're right.
their tags never get buffed.
ever.
I got to go do something. - No, no...
just wait right here. - Please don't leave me.
I'll be back, I promise.
he never came back.
I was so mad, I slashed his mural.
I heard the next day on the streets, he'd been killed.
you said he took your paint?
five cannons of my signature orange.
know where he went?
no. He was right, though.
there's more to life than just bombing.
question is: Where did he go with that paint?
Yeah, only the one can found at the crime scene.
wasn't any graffiti in that alley.
look. The wall behind Carlos's body is completely bare.
it seem odd to you-- a whitewashed wall in NRKE territory?
would have been hit a hundred times.
that wall's got a story to tell.
let's peel back the layers.
your liquor store, your gym, your El stop, your dear mother's church.
playing a game-- This is Your Life? Cops must be bored.
sit up.
listen to the lady.
above your liquor store, Turbo 102.
on your gym marquee, Turbo 102.
on the church door, Turbo 102.
that your tag? - Tut is my scribe.
Yeah, in the 80s. Then the mayor cracked down, you need a new tag, one nobody could connect to you.
that... that all you got, huh?
random coincidence in my hood?
matched the paint samples from Turbo 102
with auto paint in your body shop.
it's expensive, but... you get it wholesale, right?
you got me, I'm, I'm Turbo 102.
you stink like a rat.
who you calling a rat, man? I'm the King.
Yeah, King Snitch.
made anonymous calls about Carlos and his friend Leon.
I ain't no rat, man. Lowest life-form there is, except for pigs.
got something else you want to say, hmm?
come on in, Don.
a snitch used to call him every day.
always the same voice.
now he loves to talk. Go ahead, say something.
say something! - Son of a bitch, you're a dead man, man!
that's him.
sit your ass down. - That's police brutality, man!
no, brutality is what they do to snitches in the badlands.
other bombers found out, you'd have been a walking corpse.
Carlos was about to share your dirty secret with the whole neighborhood.
you had to shut him up.
look, I tried to give that fool an out. - But he wouldn't take it.
little punk thought he was better than me!
Yeah, thought he could ruin your rep.
spent years getting up, building my name.
Yeah, you said a name was the only thing you had in this world.
reason I took his.
bitch thought he could get me killed, thought he could be King.
there's only one King.
what the hell you doing?
been waiting for you to get here.
Yeah, my boys been telling me you been putting up lies.
I'm here to take 'em down.
your boys combing the streets so you can rat us taggers out?
turbo 102. That's your new name?
I kind of like it.
that's my boy you got killed with your snitching.
it's my tag now, bitch.
don't even touch it. Leave it alone, man.
said I'm gonna take it down. That's what I'm gonna do.
I'll take it down myself if you lay off other bombers.
you giving me orders?
I'm the King!
it ain't about staying up.
we can do more, change things around here
everyone dying on the streets.
you high or something?
I said take it down.
what's the life expectancy for a snitch?
take it down.
you might as well not even exist.
take... it... down!
guess that's the only way you're going to stay King 'cause it sure as hell ain't your skills doing the trick.
ernest
step right up! Step right up, boys and girls of all ages for the final act of our big top extravaganza!
let's hear it one more time for Zelda, Queen of Knives!
and now, City of Brotherly Love, birthplace of the American circus, let me introduce to you our Human Butterfly,
Mia Romanov and her magical metamorphosis!
well, boss, you wanted to see me?
sit down.
Moe Kitchener. - What about him?
he got shot last night outside a bar over in Roxborough.
you're serious? - Large caliber slug, back of the head.
so... he's dead?
where were you last night, Lil?
home. I was, uh, finishing up a report.
you're going to need someone to confirm that.
Who-Who's the investigating detective?
Doherty wants the state police to handle it.
they're gonna want to talk to you.
you all right?
I don't know.
listen, I told the boss if anyone wants to know, you were home when I dropped off that file last night.
the file...? - Yeah. Rodriguez file,'06.
no way you could've been across town when Moe caught one outside that bar.
Yeah.
Thanks. - Yeah.
listen, I got a lady waiting on a case.
I'll handle it.
I want to...
keep working.
detectives Valens. Rush.
you got something on an old homicide, Miss Deluca?
Mia Romanov. An aerialist for the Jones Brothers Circus.
the circus?
her death was ruled an accidental fall in 1971.
you' re saying it wasn't?
Mia did a silk act where she came out of a coon high above the rafters.
I knew something was wrong the moment she came out.
this a bad time?
what?
no. Uh, you were there the night of her fall?
my mother worked at Jones Brothers Circus.
she was a fortune-teller.
I'm a psychic.
always felt Mia's "accident" was anything but.
then just tell us who you "feel" killed her, and we'll clear this up by lunchtime.
doesn't work that way.
Yeah, it never does.
always wondered how Mia could've fallen.
and then I found these at an exhibit,"Death Under the Big Top.
photographs of various tragic falls, including Mia's.
you can see how the other performers braced for impact.
Mia didn't. - Fell head first.
arms limp, hands at her side.
might've been unconscious.
or already dead.
you think that her fall was some kind of cover-up?
Mia grew up in the circus. Had the agility of a cat.
something wasn't right. I felt it.
Yeah, we got that.
we'll be in touch, Isabel.
your mother will be fine.
you-- I'm not so sure.
Mia Romanov, 18. Died in St. Mary's Fairgrounds in '71.
ruled accidental.
more like inevitable.
flying through the air on nothing but silk?
not much here by the way of statements.
well, getting circus folk to talk isn't easy.
finally got warrants, you're looking at an empty lot.
assigned spoke to a few audience members.
said Mia looked fine giving her pre-act bow.
so whatever happened to her, happened backstage.
it's got the stink of sabotage all over it.
A/V blew up the picture of Mia's fall.
me said the shadow around her nose and mouth could be blood.
before impact.
autopsy report: broken neck, shattered skull
thought to have been caused by the fall, but hands and wrists only suffered minor damage.
she didn't brace for impact. Survival instinct never kicked in.
run all the performers for priors, anything else we can dig up on this big top.
Mia was legally adopted by Sheldon Burgess, AKA Cleo the Clown.
never gave a statement.
got an address over in Point Breeze.
well, go talk to this clown.
Mr. Burgess?
Hey, welcome to Cleo's Fun House. What can I do for you?
homicide. We're looking into the death of Mia Romanov.
all these years later?
what can you tell us about her fall?
she was trying a new stunt.
it's the worst night of my life.
how come you didn't give a statement, Mr. Burgess?
I climbed deep into a bottle that night.
stayed there for a long time after.
it never crossed your mind that maybe it wasn't an accident?
silks weren't cut or frayed.
thought the moment got the best of her.
so who was in charge of sending up her coon?
uh, gaucho, day players, in and out.
but Mia did her own rigging.
she was stubborn, like her father.
her father?
the Romanovs have been kicking the sawdust for five generations.
they were royalty amongst us kinkers.
and Mia was like her folks:
more comfortable in the air than on terra firma.
how does a clown in a traveling circus adopt a little girl?
I was her godfather.
her parents willed her to me, but the circus raised her.
jones Brothers was a one-ring mud show, but we were family.
anyone backstage with her?
the act before hers, Zelda "The Queen of Knives" Panay.
Zelda and Mia get on all right?
Oh, sure. Long as Zelda was the headliner.
what the hell was that tonight?
Williamsport? Used to pack 'em to the stingers.
now, we're lucky to be making horse feed out there. - You still getting paid, Cleo?
this dog and pony show is dying, Biggie.
we need an aerial act. - Can't afford one, so unless you got one in that wig of yours...
no way a knife-thrower can carry the big top.
excuse me? - No offense, Zelda.
I've been... - Stop it.
everybody, please, just...
I ca... I can give us an aerial act.
Mia, I didn't mean you should...
I can fly. It's in my blood.
she's a baby.
well, what do we got to lose?
even a baby can see we're dying.
I'll talk to management.
start putting it together, kid.
I don't know, Mia. - It's going to be fine, Cleo.
accidents happen.
...was the headliner prior to Mia?
Yeah, ever since the last aerial act walked.
I didn't want Mia up there.
hate to think I put a target on her.
sounds like Zelda wasn't ready to put her knives away.
thanks for coming in.
well, if I'd known you were so handsome, I would've sprinted all the way from Atlantic City.
I don't mean to be rude, but, uh, can we get going on this, because... I got a show, at 6: 00.
still performing? - Yeah, well, it's mostly blue plate dinners for seniors.
but they rember me from The Ed Sullivan Show.
how did you and Mia Romanov get along?
fine. I took her under my wing.
she was like my sister.
you always throw daggers at family?
darling...
even a lady loses her cool sometimes, which accounts for three out of four of my divorces.
foolish. Jealous.
jealous enough to get rid of her?
what do you mean?
she fell.
I was there.
with her backstage before her act.
your "sister" ends up dead and you get to keep your spotlight.
now, I got my pride.
but I'm not stupid.
we needed Mia's act to work.
it was all over, for all of us.
Where's the trapeze bar?
forget the trapeze. Biggie, we need something new. We need dramatic.
you'll never be ready in a week trying to get a new act together.
just do what your folks taught you.
I need a theme.
to tell a story. I need some time. - You're not a clown anymore.
it's not about stories. It's about wowing them.
Yeah, that's what I'm trying to do. There's something groovy with the silks
the freedom it gives me... - People don't want groovy.
they want tradition.
for their kids to see and feel what they did.
maybe we can start a new one.
you know, we can capture their imagination.
great. Then imagine there's no circus when we get shut down waiting for you to get your act together.
now this is all on me?
you asked for a shot, kid, and I gave it to you.
convinced management to roll the dice. Don't hang me out to dry.
no, I'll do the silk act. I'll use a mechanic if I have to.
the advance men have been pumping your act as death-defying.
but I... - But nothing!
I took a flyer on you.
you'd better not make a fool of me.
Mia was way ahead of the curve.
she was Cirque du Soleil before they were.
now everybody's got a silk act.
what about David and Goliath?
ringmaster Biggie Jones and his goon,
Lester "Gargantuan" Smith.
biggie pushed us hard.
maybe pushed Mia too hard.
that's probably why he pulled up stakes so fast and left town that night.
you see Biggie backstage with Mia before her fall?
biggie always checked on the featured acts before they went on.
have information that you called in the 10-37 last week.
DUI check on Mr. Kitchener?
that's right.
outside the same bar that he was murdered?
the suspect was inebriated.
suspect was awaiting trial.
and what were you doing observing him in the first place?
it was a continuing investigation.
he had already filed a complaint against you.
which was completely bogus, same as this.
were you outside that bar last night, Detective?
no.
you testified Moe Kitchener tried to kill you.
you believe that.
so does the Commonwealth.
maybe you should talk to the DA.
said you were home last night between the hours of 9: 25 and 10: 10?
that's right. - Anyone who can confirm that?
my partner, Scotty Valens.
he came by, dropped off some paperwork on a case I was reviewing.
what case?
the file's on my desk.
bunch of gink squad BS.
I need you to surrender your service weapon. - What?
until this thing blows over, you're on restricted duty.
Mia Romanov. A real tragedy, that one.
understand you checked on your acts before they hit the stage.
so how'd she look before going out?
ready to fly. Girl was good to go.
you're saying she looked good, Biggie, ready to fly?
you whizzing on the wrong hydrant there, kemosabe.
I need that girl.
without her act I lost my main moneymaker, lost the midway.
lost that, lost the circus.
then why the cover-up?
you pulled up stakes before sunup, hit the road.
now, hold your horses.
we had a long haul the next day to Allentown.
the show must go on, huh?
well, we was feeding a lot of people.
my family survived the ten-in-one to turn around and own this circus.
ten freaks in one tent.
it was humiliating.
for three generations we fought off larger predatory circuses.
Ringling.
and you banked everything on Mia, but she crossed you up.
we were family. Wouldn't sell.
loyal. We circled the tents around Mia.
but Mia stepped out of line, made her own act, didn't she?
she make a fool out of you, Biggie?
wrong. I was on board with her act.
hell, I had to be; times was desperate.
I helped her set the whole thing up.
you heard of knocking?
peace offering.
thought about what you said.
wanting a story for your act. How about this?
silk worm goes up into her cocoon to emerge as The Human Butterfly.
call it The Metamorphosis.
I don't know what to say.
biggie, that's... perfect.
so are you, kid.
we're all behind you here. You're the best we got.
I'll be ready for Philly.
and no mechanic or safety harness.
knock 'em dead, kid.
I got an act, Lester. I'm The Human Butterfly.
management had them tack spitters wallpaper the town with that bill.
she was our homegrown star.
and who was management?
J. B. Ricketts Investment.
bunch of suits out of Florida, helped us through the lean years.
got a number?
no, ma'am, that was a long time ago.
what about this Paul Bunyan?
he have a thing for Mia?
Gargantuan? I don't think he was wired that way.
his feelings were simple, childlike.
with big boy plumbing--that's reassuring.
some kind of condition? - Cerebral gigantism.
made him huge.
also made him about as sharp as a bowling ball.
so what beanstalk is he up right now?
I haven't seen him in years.
he's probably dead. Giants don't last too long.
heart can't take it.
excuse me, um, I'd like to talk to a Detective Rush.
Mr. Butler. What can I do for you?
I want to make a statement.
would you like a lawyer present, Mr. Butler?
I would not. - I recommend you get one, Hank.
all you've been through.
my wife doesn't eat anymore.
she doesn't sleep.
she just cries.
do you want to tell us what happened, Hank?
when I saw him at the courthouse, I knew.
ten, 20 years-- didn't matter.
it wouldn't go away.
I couldn't go on thinking that that smug son of a bitch was walking the Earth.
someone had to put that dog down.
listen, Hank, I didn't kill your daughter.
shut up. You buried her in a box.
you'd have let me twist forever.
sorry, Hank. It wasn't personal.
I'm sorry, too.
I went home.
I thought I'd feel better.
Katie's gone.
nothing's ever going to change that.
what do you want?
what do you want? Leave me alone. You hear me?! I seen you standing here.
I'm a cop.
I'm sorry. Police.
I didn't know! I didn't know! I,I didn't know.
people paint on my wall, break my windows...
I thought you was one of 'em. Gonna hurt me.
you thought I was gonna hurt you, Gargantuan?
lots of performers at Jones Brothers had priors, Lester.
you're the only one with a history of violence.
in and out of institutions as a kid.
beat a grown man within an inch of his life at the age of 13.
he attacked me, 'cause I was big.
what about Mia Romanov?
Yeah, you...remember her, right?
Yes. Mia.
you liked her?
pretty. Soft.
she smelled nice.
she just wasn't into the whole Beauty and the Beast thing.
so you squeezed her too hard, like you did me?
No! Mia was special.
"special"?
friend. She was my friend.
I could never hurt her.
well, someone did hurt your "friend," Lester. Someone backstage.
and then they dropped her from the ceiling.
there was this gaucho.
Eddie, right? - That's right, darlin'.
I haven't checked my rig yet.
it's looking fine to me.
get rid of that carabiner and mount it on a swivel.
Carabiner's twice as strong as a swivel.
what do I look like, some First of May?
that swivel's going to let me get out over the audience.
now, lose the carabiner.
looks like you're calling the shots around here, huh, kid?
how long you been doing this, Eddie? - Ten years experience.
rigged every big rock and roll show from Vancouver to Miami.
then you should know a performer needs to check their rig before it's flown.
how old are you, sweet cheeks?
old enough. Are you hopped up, Eddie?
I'm the one 50 feet in the air. You gonna be on that junk, you can stay away from me and my rig.
I want you out of my tent. Now!
get out. Or I'll have you dragged out.
all right, look. Easy, big fella, easy.
all right, I dig it.
if that's what the little lady wants.
Ouch!
now that would hurt.
Eddie wasn't one of us.
not circus folk.
he poisoned her.
you mean with drugs?
was he selling to the crew?
this rigger, he responsible for putting Mia's coon in the air?
till she kicked him out of the big top.
they made him shovel after the elephants.
Eddie left after Mia...fell.
I went to Jones.
the bartender said you took Nick home.
Yeah. He was plastered by the time I got there.
something's up with him. - Lot of that going around.
still thirsty?
I heard about your dance with Gargantuan.
had him right where I wanted him.
Yeah.
you ring him up for assault?
guy belongs in the puzzle house, not county.
punks were harassing him.
tagged "freak" on his building.
cruel world.
I filed three separate police reports.
he was just protecting himself.
I'm sorry I wasn't there.
Almost...lit him up, Lil.
wanted to.
thanks for... having my back.
with Moe. The alibi.
partners, right?
Yeah.
I still can't believe it.
what Hank did. - Just beat you to it.
so what does that make me?
human.
protect and serve, right?
the innocent. Lil.
need more Hanks out there.
the guy deserves a medal.
you believe that?
Yeah.
Yeah, I believe that.
just be glad someone else did it.
that he's gone.
the fortune-teller said something about your mom.
she okay?
time comes, Lil...
I might need you to have my back, too.
partners, right?
thought I was invisible.
so did we, till we found your name in a Jones Brothers payroll.
quite a healthy rap sheet you got there, Eddie.
mama always said I had a little bit of the devil in me.
sure she's real proud: drugs, cons, kiting checks...
youthful indiscretions, Detectives.
made a few mistakes.
is she one of those indiscretions?
you might say that.
destroying Mia's rig, threatening her in front of witnesses--those aren't mistakes?
wait a second. I didn't even work the big top.
I know. She had you kicked out.
had you shoveling pachyderm pies.
cost you money, not to mention your pride. About to narc you out.
but you weren't looking to do jail time, so you did her instead.
you got me. Guilty as charged.
if you call love a crime. - "Love"?
anyone could see that that girl was a bud about to bloom.
all she need was a double dose of Eddie.
I might just hit you on principle.
seem to have that effect on women.
the other side of desire.
that young lady was bursting with it.
Hey, I'm sorry about yesterday.
I've been shoveling crap my whole life.
so don't losem any sleep over me, okay?
I'm just under a lot of pressure and I could've handled it better.
I heard about your folks.
it takes a lot of guts doing what you're doing.
well, I don't really know what else to do.
I mean... family needs me.
I guess you had to grow up a little fast around here.
so maybe, you and I aren't so different after all.
sounds like you've been around quite a bit.
what about you? I never heard of a circus that didn't travel.
I've been to a bunch of places, but I never get to leave the lot.
never? - Once.
when I was a little girl, my mom took me down to Bourbon Street.
new Orleans. - There was one of those jazz funerals.
something eerie about it, but...
it was beautiful.
we should go out tonight.
I'm not sure Cleo would like that.
not all adventures are out there.
you should come with me.
where?
anywhere but this stick and rag show.
you're 18. You can do anything you want.
Mia! Giving it up to some gaucho!
have you lost your mind?!
come on! - No!
get out. Come with me! - Wait...
Cleo! No! - Come on!
I felt bad for Mia. If you ask me, there was something weird was going on between those two.
you know, she was 18 and they were still sharing a boxcar. Sketchy.
sketchier than an alcoholic clown?
next day, she had a busted lip, compliments of Cleo.
you painted a pretty picture of Mia, Cleo.
but, uh, but she wasn't such an angel, now, was she?
droppin' acid, doing riggers...Then there's you.
me?! What the hell's that supposed to mean?
keeping tight quarters with a teenage girl all those years... Used to having her by your side.
what are you saying? - Take a seat.
I slept on the floor.
I would never, ever do what you're suggesting.
Mia was my daughter. - She was not blood.
was to me!
maybe I was strict and overprotective, but that place was swarming with snakes.
like Eddie Armstrong? - Damn straight.
combed the lot, found her tripping with that...
fink trying to get in her pants. I just snapped.
Oh, busted her lip trying to show her who's boss.
No! Never laid a hand on her.
she was so out of it, kept falling.
I watched her all night till she finally came down.
always there to catch her, huh?
not always.
but I tried.
but you couldn't let go.
and all you had was her and that bottle.
she was becoming a woman. You were losing her.
holding her back so much that...you were suffocating her.
no, you're wrong. Loved her so much, I wanted her to go.
she need to get away from that place.
from me.
for Mia Romanov and her amazing
metamorphosis!
you looked just like your mother up there.
you liked it?
I've seen the future, and you're it, kiddo.
your act is too good for this top.
what are you talking about? This is exactly what we need.
you heard the crowd. This will save us.
this place is dying. You don't need to die with it.
but this is my family. Cleo, I'm not going anywhere.
you know how... when a circus elephant is born, the bull handler will secure it with a thin rope tied to a skinny stick in the ground?
sure, and when that elephant grows up, that rope and skinny stick can still make him stay put.
that stick can't hold you anymore.
are you calling me an elephant?
I wish she'd listened to me, but it was already too late.
she fell the next night.
buried her in the Romanov family plot.
a few days later, I was back on the sawdust in Allentown.
a few days?
thought the circus was due in Allentown the night after the accident?
don't know who told you that.
no, we had a week between stops.
got the route card to prove it.
losing track of all your lies, Biggie.
told us you were due in Allentown when you had a week between gigs.
we had to wildcat it out of there after Mia's nosedive.
especially since you had a murder scene to tear down.
come on, who's going to take their kiddies to see us after a fall like that?
thought with a little extra time, we could drum up some business in Allentown.
I know what it looks like, but it was a business decision.
you weren't the only one making business decisions.
found out Ringling Brothers wanted Mia.
Ringling-- they tried to poach everyone.
after everything your family had done for her.
raising Mia as one of their own.
knew if you lost her, it was all over.
but Mia wouldn't fall in line.
left a little man with a big temper holding the bag.
and when it's all said and done, Mia ends up eating sawdust.
come on, you guys.
do I look like I could hurt anyone?
spoke to Biggie, Lester.
remember him?
Yes. Biggie.
well, he says youkilled Mia.
me?
biggie couldn't have killed Mia.
couldn't have lifted her up into that coon.
I'm thinking he forced you to do it, Lester.
like he always forced you.
you don't have to be scared of Biggie anymore.
he can't hurt you.
no, you got it wrong!
you put yourself at the scene, Biggie.
said she was "good to go."
Mia was dead. You got Lester to stuff her into silks justto cover it up.
I'd done some things I had to do. But I did not kill Mia.
if you could please find it in your heart to donate again to help orphaned children get a chance to see The Human Butterfly.
in return, for helping make these children's dreams come true, your company name will be featured in our special program.
Hey, Mia.
what are you doing here?
this makes no sense. It says we've sold 800 tickets. The top only sits 400.
what are you doing, Biggie? - All right, everyone. Scram.
listen, sweetheart, to make sure that the show can go on,
I've had to be a little creative.
we're not affiliated with any charity, but you're selling tickets in their name.
where were these kids in the stands?
it's a write-off to local businesses.
it's one thing to rip people off on the midway, but you're going to use my act to scam charities for orphans?
what do you care?
you'll be flying under the Ringling Top soon.
what? - That's right. I know all about it.
I can't believe you, Biggie.
I was going to tell them "no." But now?
once I told management, it was out of my hands.
"Management," huh?
controlled the whole thing.
and just who was this management?
bunch of suits out of Florida. - You see, that's a crock.
the SEC has no record of J. B. Ricketts Investments.
but Wikipedia does.
J. B. Ricketts founded the American circus.
died in 1799.
there was no "management."It was you. - No.
if it were just that simple.
you were diagnosed with, uh, is it "cerebral gigantism"?
it's a pretty rare disorder.
often accompanied with diminished mental capacity.
the D. A.'s willing to cut a deal for you.
we don't want to send you to County, so you tell us what happened and we'll make sure you go to a comfortable medical facility.
Oh, yeah, they'll get you squared away.
in a year or two, you're a handyman in Reading again.
help us put Biggie away for good.
biggie was a... a monster.
he...
he... he... he made me.
this lifeline, those meds--pretty expensive. I didn't know the circus had such great benefits.
so, we decided to check.
turns out they don't.
your medicine is paid for by a private company.
same company pays your rent.
you don't get it, do you? - No, I get it.
and you're going to prison, and there's no PPO in the pokie.
a guy like you won't last six months.
last time, Big.
who was management?
he made me.
man, I hope we got that on video. Submit it to the Academy.
see, the thing is, people with cerebral gigantism, although usually bigger as children, are often in the normal height range as adults.
far from normal, Gargantuan.
that country doctor misdiagnosed you.
you don't have cerebral gigantism. You're just big.
no, but you ain't no dummy.
see, I wanted to talk to your boss.
went to the city tax assessors to see who owns that building you maintain.
found out, it's you. You own it.
along with half a dozen others. Big Top, Incorporated.
same company that pays Biggie's bill.
you were "management.
me?
Biggie's confession.
I'd give it to you in picture form, but we know you weren't hit with the idiot stick.
in fact, you're a millionaire.
now, Biggie told us how his circus was dying till you took it over.
you weren't his puppet. He was yours.
seen that fear in your eyes all my life.
but when those cake eaters would step into ten-in-one...
looking at me.
laughing.
pointing.
they thought I was on exhibit.
but I was studying them.
so you concocted a scam to get back at them. Steal their money.
prove you were smarter.
no. It was about preserving our family.
our livelihoods.
the one place where no one would treat me like a freak.
but Mia busted you on your scam.
wouldn't take part.
we could've moved on. Gone back to the family we were.
I couldn't just... sit by and have her tear us apart.
wanted to wish you a good show, kid.
but Mia, what you saw, those phone calls, will never happen again, Mia.
we'll sell out with your act and some old-fashioned bally.
family again.
no blood, no foul.
you expect me to trust you? You're a con.
Mia, listen... - You know what a con man hates most?
people knowing the truth.
look, there's no need to get the cops involved.
I'm a kinker. No cops. After the show, I'm telling the family the truth.
Mia! Don't be a fool.
let them make their own decisions, Biggie.
I've already made mine.
now, I gotta fly.
the June
been waiting for you, baby. Where you at?
when exactly you going to be home?
I just got a little hung up, baby.
I'm on my way back to the city now.
I don't understand what you been doing all this time.
starting to worry. You know I hate to worry, babe.
Oh, no, sweetie. There's nothing to worry about.
I just finished setting up our contacts down here.
"Contacts"? Like what, your family?
no, I just lined up that doc who writes scrips, as long as we kick back and keep it all in cash.
so you're on your way driving back now?
Yeah, I'll be back before sunup.
well, that's good, babe, 'cause I can't wait to see your lying ass!
who the hell do you think you're talking to?
get in here!
stop it!
someone here to see you, Will.
yeah?
daughter Wanda shot and dumped in the Badlands back in '93.
bana bread, hmm?
17 years this November.
calls me every year asking if there's been a break.
been hanging these faithfully.
wish I could tell you we have a break in the case, Mrs. Johnson, but...
I got a call on my flyer, Detective.
man says he saw Wanda in a car that night.
alive.
night she was killed? - Yes.
green car, just like the one the other witness said.
where?
corner of Kip and Cambria.
that's a bad drug corner.
I know.
but my Wanda didn't mess with drugs, Detective.
she was a good girl.
you should have done that homework last night.
mama, please. It's done.
and you didn't eat your breakfast.
I got a Pop-Tart.
Wanda, honey? - What?
you going to run barefoot?
you forgot your track shoes. - Bye.
are you forgetting something else?
mom? - You're still my little girl.
ten minutes late to pick her up from practice and she was gone.
this man-- he just happened to see her?
I grilled him good.
I believe he's telling the truth.
we'll bring him in. Check his story.
calls himself Brother Olajuwon now.
says he turned his life around.
Oh, one of those.
I'd prefer if you keep an open mind, Detective.
Hey, Valens. Did you hear about Mota?
what's that?
just got Swiss-cheesed in the shower up in the big house.
Really? - You didn't know about that?
just now hearing it.
hmm, just asking 'cause, uh,
I saw the visitation logs and you were up there now two days ago paying Hector Cruz a visit.
Yeah. Yeah, it's some other case I'm working.
something I need to worry about?
hmm, or anybody else for that matter?
I don't see why.
couldn't have happened to a nicer guy.
Yeah.
thanks for the heads-up.
Hey, buddy.
anybody asking for a Christina Rush last night, room 48?
I'm sorry. That information will require a warrant from a judge or a magistrate.
what?
under the Fourth Amendment based on probable cause.
you're going to require orthodontia you don't start answering the right way.
Christina Rush, 48.
I'm sorry. There's no one that's checked in or out this week by that name.
you open up or I'm going to put that fire extinguisher through this window.
well, that wouldn't seem prudent.
do I need to call the police?
better yet, how about I call Vice?
shut down this fleabag for narcotics and prostitution.
who paid the bill?
they haven't checked out yet.
Bernie, que paso?
what?
are you kidding me?
I was just informed by housekeeping that the room is trashed.
the woman in 48, what did she look like?
sandy blonde, in her 30s.
looks a little like you.
you take a credit card for the deposit?
I waived it on account of her general hotness.
that, and she paid cash.
anyone else coming or going from this room?
just you, and now the room is trashed.
Hey, who's going to pay for this?!
don't see that witness statement about the car back in '93.
could have swore it was here.
Inez Kellog, little old lady got a partial on a green SUV leaving the dump site.
anybody else been in the box?
not according to the log.
but you remember it?
Yeah. Never went anywhere 'cause she couldn't I. D. the model or year.
Oh... New info puts Wanda in a similar car three blocks from there.
this guy better not be sowing false hope.
Hey, you all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.
but Christina's gone.
along with my service weapon.
Lil, you've got to call this in.
I need your help getting them both back.
but you don't report it stolen, it gets used in a crime, that's it, Lil. You're done.
look, I know what this means, Scotty.
I'm asking for your help.
what do we got?
well, the guy tossed the room. He was looking for something.
oxys. Who's "Alexis Childress"?
the same name the room's under.
it's all we got to go on.
but you want to go after these guys without a gun?
don't worry.
I got a gun.
As-salaam alaikum, Detective.
and it's Brother Olajuwon now.
Yeah. Only reason we're meeting like this is 'cause of Althea Johnson.
she said I could trust you.
you find the prophet while doing that dime up at Camp Hill, brother?
Allah had a plan for me.
that plan include sprouting a conscience?
the first thing I saw when I finished my incarceration was that woman out there in a blizzard hanging flyers.
she wanted to find out what happened to her daughter.
Yeah. Well, I saw that girl's face, and I remembered... 
name's Wanda. Where'd you see her?
like Brother Malcolm, I, too, was in the game.
dealing.
the corner was "poppin'" as they say in the pusher parlance.
Wanda trying to cop?
I don't know what she was doing in that car.
just knew something wasn't right.
yo, check off, Young.
I don't like that one.
something ain't right with that.
can't get that girl's face out of my thoughts.
you get a good look at the car?
green Ford Explorer.
got a head for cars?
skill set you get on the corner.
only way to read your customer.
What'd that car say to you?
Caucasian car-- that's how come I remembered.
wondered what a beautiful, young sister was doing in a ride like that.
you see anybody in there with her?
no. Just heard voices.
some kind of dispute, then the gun went off.
different model years of Ford Explorers.
tell me which one you recognize.
like that.
92 Ford Explorer.
sure?
had one of them DARE stickers on it.
Where'd you get that?
it was a gift.
you prepared to use that thing?
they got my sister.
assaulted me and took my gun.
just evening the odds.
start with this Rothman Drugs doling out a lifetime supply of painkillers, huh?
100 count, 160 milligrams.
that's a lot of blues. Worse than I thought.
what's that mean?
come on, Lil. You saw her.
it's what pill-poppers do: use fake names to get scrips.
why you so sure that they're Christina's?
checked into that fleabag under the same alias.
he's gotta use a fake name 'cause she can't get a scrip for a controlled substance with a record.
you know, my sister's a lot of things, but a drug addict?
you know something I don't, Scotty?
here we go.
when's the last time you saw her?
when was that?
she called me... a couple days ago...
just tell her I'll be back soon, okay, baby?
all right, take care.
thanks for coming.
listen, I know I left a mess last time I was in town.
I'm really sorry about that.
what do you need, Christina?
so it's like that, huh? - Yeah, it's like that.
just get to it.
you're the only one who really knows my sister;
what she's like, what she's thinking.
I don't know about that.
I wanna know if she still hates me.
you're talking to me.
you haven't even spoken to her yet, have you?
do you think there's a chance that Lilly could ever get past it?
what difference does it make? You're just gonna skip town.
no, no. That's just it.
I want to move back.
this is my home. This is where my family is.
I don't know, Christina.
you're gonna have to call Lilly yourself.
but you might wanna get cleaned up first.
I'm trying, Scotty.
I'm really trying.
I know that look from Narcotics.
it wasn't pinned... but she was jonesing.
my sister... hooked on hillbilly heroin, and you didn't tell me?
what the hell was I supposed to say, Lil? After what happened last time?
Hey, wait, wait, wait.
what are you doing?
you lied to my face!
what? - See? I knew you would react this way.
why you think she came to me first, Lil?
of course, why wouldn't she?
it says a lot about your relationship, don't it?
you think I wanna get put in the middle of this all over again?
it didn't stop you before.
just another piece to you right, Scotty?
you know, why don't ya take your ass back up to the feds and take that big job?
you can forget about us just like you forgot about your sister.
What?!
I figured you were her next stop anyway.
was I right?
why wouldn't you just tell me?
I don't know, Lil.
maybe I got my own family to deal with.
did you ever think of that?
we just gonna stand here arguing all damn day...
or are we gonna go get your gun and Christina back?
anybody seen Rush today?
some family thing with her sister. Think Scotty went to help her out.
I don't even want to know.
that missing witness statement turn up?
gone.
any luck with the partial plates ran back in the day?
I got 40 '92 green Ford Explorers, but none of 'em checked out.
wreck, alibi, in for repair, out of search radius.
what about this one?
every other one has a reason why it was deleted.
did you farm out any legwork back in the day?
I was busy chasing down witnesses, so I used Joe Mueller in patrol.
this is fault of patient.
people change numbers, fax in forge scrips.
addicts stop at nothing to get pills.
ten refills and you don't even double-check with the doc?
she didn't look like an addict.
was she alone or was she working with someone?
what do you mean? - It's a lax pharmacy that doles out pills like candy.
word spreads fast. - Lies!
you pulled the records. She was paying cash, right?
you dealing painkillers or drug addicts?
I call the DEA, that's fed time, Nazir.
look, we're not interested in busting you.
we're looking for this woman and anyone else she was working with.
she came alone.
but she had the same address on her I. D.as the two other guys from New York.
same address? What other guys?
new York I. D. They paid with cash.
how often these guys come in?
first guy's been in here before. Knows not to come more than once a week.
well, what about this other guy?
don't recognize him, but this is not the only place that takes cash.
all using fake New York I. D.s. - And you don't report it.
I'm cooperating with you now.
pharmacies that play ball with drug addicts.
just one stop on the circuit?
like clockwork.
and I can tell you the place they're going to hit up next.
got a minute, Joe?
Yeah.
signed Ryan Howard bat-- wife beat her husband to death with it last night.
well, maybe the Phillies will sign her.
Yeah, maybe.
what's up? - Been going over the Wanda Johnson case.
drawing a blank.
15-year-old girl killed in the Badlands back in '93.
had you run some partial plates from an eyewitness statement.
you say so. - We got a better description of the car.
turns out we were looking for a '92 Ford Explorer.
came up zilch. - Yeah, we see that.
why'd you cross this one out?
that was a long time ago.
if I had to guess, I'd say it was a wrong plate or something.
well, you listed a reason for all the others.
that one... nothing.
I'll have to, uh, consult my field notes, jog my memory.
like to see those notes, you don't mind.
Yeah. I'll get right on that.
covering up for sloppy work?
let's hope that's all it is.
before you even any odds with that street gun...
this thing's still packing a charge.
I can't believe she's hooked on painkillers.
probably after some injury. That's how it starts.
I mean, all the crap we went through with my mom.
growing up.
you know, people think they can just kick it.
it ain't that easy.
these pills, going straight from that pharmacy to the street.
they grind up the time-release Oxys to smoke, snort, shoot, whatever.
docs give 'em to anybody.
pharmacists are...
I found this in the room.
she tried to show it to me.
said she remembered that swimsuit.
but she was only like... five.
I got photos of me that age.
makes you think you remember being there.
that him?
Hey, I'm, uh, just knocking off to grab those files for you.
don't bother!
get your hands off me!
I'm giving you one chance to explain how come you buried this.
it was a fluke.
Doherty had nothing to do with that girl getting killed.
then why did you delete the file?
he was my lieutenant.
that puts him off-limits?
look, I gave him a heads-up.
we had a good laugh about it, and that was it.
he ask you to bury the report?
no. I figured the last thing my lieutenant need was his name popping up in a hot investigation.
well, it popped.
look, I got respect for chain of command.
so do I, Joe.
except when it comes to covering up a crime.
there wasn't no cover-up.
breathe a word of this to anybody, I'll have you pushing a sector car around the 12th.
Yeah, we'll see about that.
where is she, numbnuts?
you scream when I take that sock out, I'll make you eat this whole bottle.
the hell?
What'd I do?
where is Christina?
how the hell should I know?
that's Cliff's old lady.
who the hell's Cliff, and where is he?
back in Jersey. I don't know.
I hooked him up once to move some blues
easy stuff from pain clinics in Florida.
run them up I-95 to Newark.
so, why is Cliff coming down here?
cause he sent his woman down here to buy some pills, and she kept lying to him, saying she couldn't get a hold of me.
why would she lie to him?
she said she was working on another hookup.
one week turned to two, Cliff started losing it.
he said he was going to have her ass.
and you knew where she was staying?
I saw her outside a rehab clinic, and I followed her to the Grand.
and you told him where she was.
Cliff-- he's got a possessive mean streak.
Unhinged-like.
he gave her the pimp hand and hauled her ass out of there.
and you went there with him.
no. He just told me to go back and find the stash.
I found you instead.
you took my gun. Where's my sister?
your sister? What?
no, man, that was Cliff. He took the gun, too.
you said he was in Jersey.
where? - I don't know.
Jersey City-- I never been up there.
I don't even know the dude's last name.
come on, man. All I got's a cell number.
check my phone. It's a Jersey area code.
we'll be back. Better be right.
try to make it last.
what? No dip?
that deleted plate match came back belonging to Doherty.
could be one of those grassy knoll coincidences.
be inclined to go there with you, Nick, except I also got a missing witness statement.
nobody's been in that box except you.
well, that's where Nightstick Joe comes into the picture.
let me guess.
he deleted the license plate that came back to Doherty.
Yeah. See where I'm going with this?
he's trying to get in with the bosses, so he buries the report.
worse-- he shows it to Doherty.
and Doherty says he'll take care of it.
I owe it to Wanda Johnson to follow this thing to the end.
Yeah, you're going to follow it right into forced retirement.
so mote it be.
U got anything else linking Doherty to this except his car and a missing witness statement?
how about a gun?
Wanda was shot with a .38.
Doherty never turned in his department-issue. 38 when we got the new Glocks.
looks just like this old wheel gun of mine.
you think a police lieutenant killed a 15-year-old girl?
there's one way to find out.
suppose you know where Doherty keeps his gun.
desk, top right drawer, next to the bottle of Old Spice.
just walk in there and get that gun?
doherty's got his local clergy meeting tonight.
but after that...
the sink's clogged in the ladies' room, Sal.
I'll get to it after I finish touching up the big boss's office.
you been hitting the gym?
just pushing this mop and bucket.
you're looking toned.
what did you say was wrong with the sink?
accusing the deputy commissioner of murder, Will, I mean, that's career suicide.
16 years I've been chewing on this case.
dreading the baked goods she sends every year letting me know her daughter's killer is still out there.
you better get your ducks lined up, Will, before you go slinging accusations at the brass.
in the process of doing just that.
what are you up to, Will? - Suppose Doherty's gun were to turn up.
could you get preliminary ballistics on it from FIU?
we better be talking hypothetical here because I am all out of favors upstairs.
one deputy commissioner's gun.
subscriber info on the cell comes back to Clifton Harper in Jersey City Heights.
she's got this deranged boyfriend after her.
she really knows how to pick them.
easy.
I don't know why I should care anymore.
still blood.
still... hurts.
look, I'm sorry I dragged you into this mess.
Nah. I should have told you before.
I mean, I-I feel like I'm still responsible for her.
I-I don't know how to... keep doing this.
she went through what you did, too.
well, you would think it would have brought us closer, but I barely remember a time when we got along.
when we were just... sisters.
don't worry.
we'll build it again.
one weekend, my dad came back.
he, uh, took us to the beach.
Christina was so happy.
but I knew.
you knew what?
he was just gonna leave again.
and he did.
look, whatever happens, Scotty... thanks.
you pulled me out of a mayoral fund-raiser, John.
this better be good.
got a few questions, Pat.
you got questions, you come up to the fifth floor and ask 'em in the morning.
I don't think you want that.
careful, Detective.
that supposed to mean something?
well, we got a break in the case.
great. Work it.
is this some kind of stunt?
Wanda Johnson was shot and killed in the Badlands back in '93.
witness came forward, puts Wanda in your car.
green '92 Ford Explorer.
sounds like you have an unreliable witness.
Oh, your car popped back in the day off a partial plate.
got deleted from the file.
okay. I see where this is going.
and I'll warn you right now.
I'll have both your badges and your pensions.
take your best shot.
we'll see whose badge goes first.
what the hell does that mean?
witness statement putting your car at the crime scene turned up missing from the box.
you don't want the feds in this, Pat. We're doing you a favor.
we're done here.
not until you tell us how a bullet from your gun ended up killing Wanda Johnson.
you're bluffing.
came back a definitive match, Pat.
I'd like my FOP lawyer now.
I'm still waiting for the truth.
and I'd still like my lawyer.
STILLMAN: Night Wanda was shot you were at Timmy Murphy's wake.
the whole department was there. - Yeah. So what?
I know what you're doing here, Pat.
stay out of this, John.
you left your gun at home.
no. - Car was in the Badlands.
I know all about your boy Matt's struggle with drugs.
this had nothing to do with my son, and I'll stand for the gun.
that girl's mother has been twisting in the wind for 16 years.
I said Matty didn't do this.
how do you know that?
because I asked him.
what's this?
I was gonna tell you about that.
I'm listening.
me and Ronnie... - You went out drinking?
No! - Don't lie to me.
okay. Just a little.
how'd this happen?
Ronnie got sick, and it was an accident.
but we cleaned it up, though.
anything else you want to tell me?
I wanted to believe him.
how'd he get your gun? - I don't know.
but you knew enough when you heard about the shooting to make that plate match go away.
you knew Matty was involved.
no. - Buried that witness report.
what kind of cop does that?
he was my son.
I was trying to protect him.
it was that damn Ronnie Tavares.
I told Matt to stay away from him.
we'll talk to him.
Matt's turned his life around.
he's got a family and a son of his own now.
then maybe he'll understand the hell he's put Althea Johnson through.
good to see you've pulled yourself together, Matt.
I understand you're a father now.
lieutenant... - You know what this is about?
remember Wanda?
we got your old running buddy Ronnie Tavares in the other room.
really made something of himself: meth addict, petty theft, distribution.
he's ready to cooperate.
my father know about this?
he's prepared to take the fall for you.
you gonna let that happen, Matt?
no.
it's time to man up here, son.
how'd you know Wanda?
we met at a party the week before.
she was still in high school.
she didn't look it.
how'd you meet her that night?
we cruised by the school, picked her up.
I didn't even remember her name.
Mm-hmm, yeah Yo, Wanda.
yo, Wanda, it's me-- Ronnie.
Yeah, so?
yo, yo, yo, let's just go do this, man.
yo, in a minute, fool, relax.
yo, you're looking good, baby. Let me holla at you for a second.
Holla. - So...
me and my boy Matt right here--we're trying to get in a little adventure.
that so? - Yes.
what you doing?
waiting on my mom.
looks like she forgot you.
yo, you know we can give you a ride, right?
come on.
madam.
all right?
listen up, Ronnie.
we got Matt Doherty next door.
Yeah, good for you.
wrong, bad for you, Ronnie.
Matt's got his life together.
plus his dad's a cop, big time.
means he knows the art of the deal.
I know how to deal.
What'd Matt say?
says you lured Wanda into that car.
he said that? - Said you were gonna give her a ride home.
right. - But you end up in the Badlands?
detour. - For what?
show that dealer what's what.
he ripped us off the week before.
huh, so...
that what the gun was for?
that's not my gun, and it wasn't my idea.
Matt's painting a picture putting it all on you.
Matt... he was tripping about that dealer getting over on us.
that's him. - All right, so how you want to do this?
do what? I said I wanted to go home.
yo, chill, baby, relax.We just got some business to attend to.
now you're all Boyz n the Hood?
just tell him you want something.
I'm not telling him nothing.
check this.
come on. Are you serious? - What the hell?
we're just gonna go straight at 'em, man.
you can't go point that thing at a dealer, fool.
these guys shoot back, man.
just gonna put a little scare into him, okay?
you get my back with his boys.
you guys are crazy. I'm out.
give me that thing, man.
this is no time to... - Get off of it! Stop!
Ronnie should have never grabbed that gun.
it was an accident.
it also an accident you don't take Wanda to the hospital?
lot of things I should have done different.
worried about what your father would say?
it was all I could think about.
what the hell did you just do, man?
me? You grabbed the gun!
we got to get her to a hospital, man.
it was an accident. That's what we're gonna tell 'em, right?
it was an accident. - Wanda.
yo.
Oh, man. - Wanda.
Oh, no.
Oh, man, what are we gonna do, man?
I don't know. -Go, man, we got to get her out of this car!
Ronnie said we had to get rid of the body, so that's what we did.
just dump her like that.
I cleaned out the car, put the gun back.
then lied to your father.
but he knew, didn't he?
Yeah, I could see it in his eyes.
all these years sober.
it's like I've been waiting for this day to come.
so has Althea Johnson.
all right.
unit number for Cliff Harper is on the left.
no lights on. Nobody's home.
record for assault, domestic violence.
guy's a real charmer.
let's pull around back.
see if we can find a way in.
he did this to you?
he won't leave us alone.
Cliff-- where is he, Chris?
no matter what I do, he always finds us.
I'm so sorry, Lil.
what do you mean "us"?
you have to get out of here.
no, we're not leaving without you.
it hurts to breathe.
can you walk?
I tried.
I can't leave.
I'm not like you.
need to get her out of here.
I thought if I just left her with a friend and came home, I could get it together.
left, left who?
then I could come and get her and then we could be like that again.
what are you talking about?
Christina, we have to go.
like at the beach... in the photo that Dad gave me.
you remember that day, Lil?
Yeah. - When he came back?
Yeah, yeah, sweetie, I remember.
can you help us rebuild it, Dad?
I thought we were going to be like that again.
sisters.
sure, Chris, why not?
I want it to be like that for her.
let's get her out.
let's go.
I got to go, Lil, 'cause I got to switch out the laundry. - It's okay.
Christina, time to get up.
the hell?
how could you do that to my sister?!
don't.
you don't want to do that, Lil.
come on.
let's go home.
the following story is fictional and does not depict actual person or event June 8, 1953
look at me, Rita.
how about a little more sunshine on the goodies, huh?
zip! Men like to imagine, not see.
not this man.
you ain't seeing nothing tonight, you keep it up.
Oh...Betty, fix that sleeve.
there's nothing's wrong with it, Zip.
just move it up an inch.
Yeah, like that.
big difference.
Hey, hey, hey, every detail matters in one of my pinups.
that's why Monty knows I'm the best.
listen, this magazine is gonna be a lights-out, call-the-doctor smash.
Cornucopias of cash, my friend.
Cornucopias.
here's another fan letter from Beanie, Ree.
dear Ms. Flynn, thanks for writing me back.
I put your pinup in my locker today.
you are prettier than all the stars in the sky.
Oh, he's so sweet.
Yeah, play with the straw, Ree.
so, how was the picture show last night? - Didn't go.
well, I thought you had a date.
so did I. The rat didn't even call.
Oh, you should have come over.
some of Zip's New York friends were in town.
you party all night?
danced with the sunrise, Koo Koo.
we're going national.
my new mag's a go. Rita, they want you for the cover.
zip, you're gonna take the picture.
to Rita...
the soda jerk who changed my life.
to everyone here.
the only family I ever had.
let's paint the town red tonight!...
Jones?
we got to find another bar.
got one in mind?
how about Jones?
uh, Detective Rush?
yes? - Yeah, Gus Medica.
I'm sorry, this is the only time I could get here.
uh, we spoke on the phone yesterday.
Oh, right, the pinup girl.
it's a 53 homicide.
detective Valens. You a relative, Mr. Medica?
no, uh, just a fan.
Rita's pinup got me through the Korean War.
my grandson was just deployed to Afghanistan.
it has me thinking about Rita again.
uh, this book came out a week ago.
she was a real bombshell.
Oh, she was more than a great figure.
her smile gave me hope.
now, the book says that this is the first time that anything from Rita's crime scene has ever been published.
some records clerk moron probably buddied up to the media, let them have access to the box.
Mr. Medica, you said you had new informatio on the case?
uh, yeah. Turns out I've had it for over 50 years.
I bought this in 1955 at an estate sale of Rita's stuff.
it's not your usual cheesecake.
no... now, I'm a collector.
this is unique.
I've never, ever seen another one like it.
same clothes.
same position of the glass on the table.
that's what I noticed, same outfit, same everything.
look at the ice.
almost melted in the crime scene photo.
papers back then had said it was probably some creep, broke in...
so, who took this photo?
photographer's stamp.
as good as a signature if we could make it out.
may be a new witness.
or the one who set Rita's final pose.
grew up poor in Tacony.
mom died young. Drunk father walked out.
that's a good start in life.
discovered by Monty Moran at the drugstore where she worked with her best friend,
Betty Sue Baker.
Jeffries is trying to find her.
Betty Sue. Got to love the 50s.
downstairs neighbor heard a gunshot at 9: 00, ran up, found the chain on the front door broken and Rita's body.
looked like an attempted sexual assault.
no blood or semen, but her clothes were torn.
peeping Tom had been reported in the neighborhood. Never caught the guy.
no record of this mystery photographer.
wanted to take a picture Rita didn't.
she kicks his ass out.
he comes back without knocking.
an unregistered Webley 38 was found outside in the rain near the building.
matched the body bullet taken from Rita.
Webley's made in England. Maybe it was registered there. Worth a look.
Rita was on the cover of almost 30 pinup magazines.
those come dog-eared?
research.
early 50s: last days of selling sex with a G rating.
you have a pinup girl, boss?
had her picture taped inside my algebra book.
that will get you through math class.
check out these theme shoots.
circus Girl. - Classy.
Rita Dresses for a Night on the Town.
planting a Garden.
Gardening-- that's just hot.
actually that is kind of hot.
Arthur "Zip" Fellig was Rita's boyfriend. Last to see.
I'll try and track him down.
check with the ID unit. See what else they can get from Gus's photo of Rita.
you Francine Rafferty?
depends. - On what?
on what you want.
I got a backlog of surveillance videos to blow up.
one's from a triple.
text a early 50s.
professional print right from the developing bath.
so, this wasn't mass-produced?
no, original.
straight from a darkroom.
you missed first base, by the way.
sorry?
softball game last Saturday.
you missed it by a foot.
you were too busy admiring your home run.
I played second base.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's right.
what about the, uh...
uh, rubber stamp?
popped the ink and dirt traces.
got this.
great work, Frankie. Thanks.
you know, I touched that base.
the saddest lies are the ones we tell ourselves.
say cheese is right.
welcome to Glamour World.
who wants to be a star?
detectives Valens and Miller-- Philly Homicide.
we're here about Rita Flynn. - Rita?
my God, after all these years.
looks like you haven't forgotten.
she's more popular than ever. A whole new generation is falling in love.
500 bones? Better hope so.
it's an original signature there. It's very rare.
check out my web site. My prints of her are selling like hotcakes.
understand you worked with her.
we were a team. A good pinup isn't just about the model.
we're tracking a photographer Rita worked with.
took this.
you know him? - No.
wasn't even aware that she worked with other photographers.
seem surprised.
well, Rita and I were both under contract to Monty Moran, and...
no, Rita was faithful to me on both sides of the camera.
here you go, pops.
I'm yours exclusively.
you won't regret it.
we're like the immortal team of Buonarroti and Cavalieri.
who are they? - No idea.
I heard that line in a movie.
look, Rita.
he asked me out.
he's got blue eyes to die for.
isn't he a dish?
supper and dessert.
who is he? - He's a banker.
he's really sweet.
this one feels lucky.
um, are you Rita Flynn?
no, she's the Pope.
can I have your autograph? - Sure thing, doll.
Oh, golly.
drool is so charming.
I used to jerk soda for that fella.
bet he didn't ask for your autograph then.
life's funny, ain't it, koo koo?
Hey, Rita, it's your song. Do your thing.
aren't you tired of it? - Come on, Ree. Do it.
okay.
funny old geezer.
he's got a face like an angel.
you and me to the top of the top.
to the top of the top!
Rita was the life of the...
she was my life.
we were going to get married.
all that male attention make any boyfriend jealous.
Ah, it's just part of the business.
long as she went home with me.
back in the day, you said you were home the night Rita was killed.
hit the sack early that night for a big shoot in the morning.
what about Monty?
he could've hired this Nopell guy for another shoot.
if he was a photographer, Monty would have known him. He knew everyone.
but you never heard of him?
no. I told you I...I didn't.
stay in town, Zip.
I might be back for a headshot.
Yeah, she was a sweet kid.
she was like a daughter to me.
Yeah, to this day I blame myself.
Why's that, Monty?
well, I made her famous.
and with fame came the attention of men, good and bad.
in those days, any creep could find her address in the phone book.
you own a gun back in 53, Monty? - No. Why?
well, police never took a statement from you back then.
well, I thought she was assaulted by some sick pervert.
did Rita have her picture taken by anyone besides Zip?
Oh, guys always wanted to take her picture.
see, the thing about a good photo, you can stare at it over and over and still find a new meaning in it.
we're looking for a photographer named Stanley Nopell.
took this picture of Rita.
you ever work with him, Monty?
never heard of him.
did Rita mention anyone in particular might have been bothering her?
no, she never said anything.
but, well, there...there was a fan.
took things a little too far.
al, what part of "opportunity of Brobdingnagian proportions" do you not understand?
Hey, what's the holdup?
Zip's running late. Keep your hat on, koo koo.
so what are you gonna wear for the big date with Blue Eyes?
I don't know.
I wish I could buy something new.
borrow something from wardrobe. No one'll notice.
you think? - Sure.
but I want you to report back to me lickety-split after the date.
I want to hear everything.
smile, you're on Candid Camera.
Mr. DeMille, I presume.
sorry, boss. Traffic.
all right, hup two. Folks, break's over.
Oh, I forgot my lei!
beanie Emerson, yeah.
he was the president of Rita's fan club.
sounds like he took to the job.
the kid showed up everywhere we went.
she consider him a friend?
no, he was just a boy.
back then, we thought it was teenage hijinks.
right.
now we just call it stalking.
up all night trying to track this Stanley Nopell dude.
any luck? - The guy's a ghost.
no driver's license, voter registration-- like he don't exist.
well, we found Beanie.
got him in the box.
he still go by Beanie?
research.
How're you doing, Ben?
detectives Miller and Valens.
this really about Rita Flynn?
really is. Understand you were president of her fan club.
you bet. This was back in the 50s.
so it was you?
snuck into Rita's apartment night she died?
what? No.
you broke into her dressing room. Figure apartment's a piece of cake.
still got the panty collection, Beanie?
I was out of town with my parents when Rita died.
Florida.
that wasn't the question, Ben.
look, I was...I was 15.
you know what those pictures do to a kid that age?
got an eyewitness saw you breaking and entering, Beanie.
you were stalking her.
look, maybe I was a little bit too, you know, zealous.
I admit, I did follow her around a lot.
but it wasn't me she had to fear.
Betty, wait.
wait!
what are you doing here?
I came to show you something.
your dad said this was a restaurant.
I told my dad I'm waiting tables.
please, Rita, just go. - You need money?
I could lend you some.
you got $500 for all of last years' rent? - Doesn't your dad pay for...
my dad drinks away every penny I make from photo shoots.
you were wrong, Rita.
men do like to see.
and they pay for it.
but, Betty, this isn't you.
what if Blue Eyes finds out?
how would he find out?
Oh, no, Betty, I'd... - Go to hell!
Yeah, I thought they were friends.
but that girl...
she was angry.
ashamed or something.
shame.
guess that's something a panty sniffer like you don't suffer much, huh?
what's that supposed to mean? - Such a big fan of Rita, why didn't you tell somebody about this?
I was a minor.
I wasn't even supposed to be in that club.
well, thanks for your time...
thank you.
hello.
are you here about the Bangladesh recovery?
I'm Detective Rush Betty.
Philly Homicide. - Homicide? I don't understand.
it's about Rita Flynn.
Rita? For heaven's sake.
you told the police back then the two of you were good friends.
the best of friends.
you two ever get into a spat?
no.
she made a lot more money than you as a model.
now, how about you? You get paid enough to make ends meet?
I suppose.
you remember a club called The Red Curtain?
ms. Rush, that was a long time ago.
my father was an alcoholic who needed my help.
I'm not proud, but I did what I had to do.
desperate people do desperate things.
if you're implying I had anything to do with Rita's death...
you lied about the fight, Betty.
I was upset.
Rita calmed me down. We had a heart-to-heart.
when was this? - At the club.
only Rita could find humanity in such a depressing place.
I'm so sorry.
I just lost my temper. I'm under such pressure.
you don't have to apologize, Betty.
I just want to help you. - I know.
so what was that surprise that you came to show me?
remember when I was taking pictures?
Ta-da!
there's a great one of you.
but these aren't glamorous.
ordinary life can be beautiful, too.
ordinary life? What are you talking about?
I don't know. Real stuff.
remember when we were jerking soda, all the crazy characters who would come in?
you mean like Half-a-scoop Lou?
Yeah!
a full scoop's bad for the joints.
see, I miss people like that.
Oh, yeah...See him?
that's a face with a thousand stories.
get that camera out of here!
lady, you better destroy that picture, or so help me, I'll do it for you myself!
get off me!
you know that guy?
regular.
named Reg Donaldson.
came back from the front with a few screws loose.
world War II vet?
everyone walked around him on eggshells.
the scariest guy in a scary place.
you know if he carried a gun?
I saw him pull it one night on a drunk who took his seat by mistake.
so you saw this man pull a gun on someone, Rita's shot to death
and you never went to the police?
Detective...I saw this when I was working as a dancer.
good to see you turned your life around, Betty.
think of anything else, give me a call.
found something? - Maybe.
here.
at first, I thought this was a lighter. You see that?
Yeah, what is it?
here, look closer.
camera that took this was a Leica 3A.
it's unique for the time. That's actually the self-timer switch.
are you listening?
the Leica 3A, self-timer.
saying Rita took that photo herself.
exactly.
turns out that American shell-shocked war vet from the strip club spent time in a psych ward in England.
along with our gun. Check this out.
ID unit says the photo Gus brought in was a self-rtrait.
but the stamp says Stanley.
it's that song she used to sing.
Rita... was Stanley Nopell.
saying she was a photographer?
trying to be, at least.
not a lot of female photographers back then, so she makes up a man's name.
snaps a shot of Reg Donaldson with a stripper.
Yeah, married guy, caught red-handed.
guy's half off his nut already.
not a photo you want coming home to the missus.
so this guy wasn't going after Rita the pinup girl.
he was after Rita the photographer.
ever spend time in the UK, Mr. Donanaldson?
I thought this was about Rita Flynn.
well, if you could answer the question...
I was in England after the war.
pick up a gun while you were there?
no. - But you owned a rearm?
a Browning . 22. I worked nights in a bad neighborhood.
understand you spent some time under a doctor's psychiatric care.
what is this?
we've got witnesses saying you threatened Rita Flynn.
what? You think I shot her?
she had a photo that could have broken up your marriage.
my marriage was already broken.
I overreacted.
I-I just wanted to be anonymous.
anonymous?
I was pretty messed up after the war. Couldn't relate to people.
just a bottle in a bar.
did you see Rita again, Reg?
Yeah, she found me and apologized.
asked me to help her out, take her around the old neighborhood.
Where's that? - Tacony. She wanted to take pictures.
she pulled me out of the dark.
she said she was going to show me the pictures, but then I read in the paper that...
what a world.
where were you that night, Reg?
same place I was every night, The Red Curtain, trying to forget.
Rita mention anyone she was having problems with?
no, she was in a good mood. She said she was thinking about quitting modeling.
quick follow-up.
think Rita got that photo developed somewhere or could she have done it on her own?
lots of photography clubs back then.
home darkrooms were pretty common. - Right.
So...who are these people?
your great-grandfather in there or something?
no, I-I found it inside a used book.
every time I look at it, I see something new. You know?
that guy's derby hat there, that woman's smile.
I wonder what made her smile.
Yeah. I love the mystery of old photographs.
we'll never know. - Well, maybe we do.
you see that guy? He's knocking boots with her.
just whispered in her ear,"My compartment, five minutes."
no.
she just slipped a slow-acting poison in that guy's drink.
Why? - Well, it's her husband.
she's gonna inherit a million bucks.
wicked imagination, Frankie.
is your cell phone dead?
my phone? No.
quick follow-ups are phone calls.
unless there's another reason you stopped by.
Yeah. I got reservations.
you and me. - Dinner?
no. - What did you have in mind?
that a yes?
Yes.
Hey, Miller got a hit on the gun. Registered to a Philip Moran in London.
Moran? Related to Monty Moran?
his uncle.
couldn't be our doer because he died in January 53, five months before Rita was murdered.
uncle could have given it to Monty.
and Monty started a British version of See Magazine in 1950.
traveled back and forth all the time.
got a little gun problem, Monty.
haven't we already gone over this?
Yeah, which means either you're lying or you're starting to slip.
wasn't your magazine that got Rita killed.
it was your gun.
I never fired a gun in my life.
except the one that killed Rita.
this was registered to your dead uncle.
my God, I'd forgotten all about the damn thing.
my uncle gave it to me for a gift.
a Webley . 38. Bullet from that gun ended up in Rita.
that gun was stolen two months before Rita died.
you never reported it. - Look, this is ludicrous.
I had no reason to kill Rita.
she tell you she was going to quit modeling?
eh, she told me about it, but I wasn't upset.
you invested a lot of money in her.
would have taken a big hit of your circulation.
Yeah, but I was not about to let an asset like that walk out the door.
are you decent?
I used to be. - You should lock your door, cupcake.
what have we got here?
these are fantastic.
who took them?
me.
come on. Don't kid a kidder.
no kidding, koo koo.
you got more tricks up your sleeve than Harry Houdini.
I'm through with pinups, Monty. - Thought you were having fun.
I'm bored of making other people smile.
when I take these pictures, I smile.
so you want to ba photographer?
I don't know. Maybe.
these are like the ones they got in Life Magazine.
you could be a photojournalist, take serious pictures.
you think?
Oh, no, n-no, Rita.
uh-uh, I didn't sign you to a pinup contract 'cause I wanted your autograph, so...
but can't we work something out?
tell you what. How'd you like 'em published?
come on. Hey, don't kid a kidder.
you got a real way of understanding people.
I can see it in those pictures, too.
now you're just trying to sweet-talk me.
Hey, if I can't have you as a pinup girl, I sure as hell want you as a photographer.
as talented as Rita was in front of the camera, she was even more talented behind it.
hell, I was even going to make more money that way.
what a sell: queen of the lens.
still got some of her old negatives, too.
I never could bring myself to print them.
who else had access to that gun, Monty?
I kept it locked up in a small safe in the studio.
anyone else have a key to that safe?
no, just Zip. Kept his expensive lenses in there.
did Zip know Rita wanted to leave modeling?
I don't know, but I'll tell you one thing-- I was-- I wasn't sad to see him go.
package deal like that, I was better off without.
talking about Zip with Rita?
all that time, I thought that blowhard made her look good till I realized it was the other way around.
Yes, ma'am, uh, the pictures are ready.
are you aware of our two- for-one special on 8x10s?
special can wait, Zippy.
you remember the safe Monty had in his studio?
safe? No.
you should. He gave you a key to it.
that's where you kept your lenses, right? - I guess.
Oh, yeah, come to think of it, uh, I stored a few of 'em in there
along with his gun. Come to think of that?
no, I don't remember any gun.
well, how about Rita telling you she wanted to quit modeling?
well, that was just something she said. - Said she wanted to become a photographer.
please.
taking a few snapshots and doing what I do are two different things entirely.
I checked your resume, Zip.
you had a hard time getting work after Rita died. - I loved Ree.
it took me a while before I could photograph a woman again.
Yeah, especially since no other magazine would hire you.
barely lasted another year as a pinup photographer.
that's 'cause you were a hack. - You don't know what you're talking about.
I created Rita. - She outgrew you, Zip.
no, it was a relationship. She...she needed me.
she needed you to let her go, but you just couldn't do that.
no. I was the photographer.
I mean, we had a good thing going, the two of us.
till she had to go and turn everything upside down.
these are interesting.
who'd you say did this?
me.
what do you think?
you want to quit modeling for this?
they're ugly.
well, I'm...I'm just getting started.
I'll get better. - Stick to smiling pretty, baby.
don't ruin a good thing.
don't you believe in me, Zip?
and what about "you and me all the way to the top of the top"?
we can both do it as photographers.
look, I'm the photographer.
you're a pinup girl.
that's the way it is.
I want to take different kinds of pictures.
like a journalist. - Journalism takes brains.
dedication.
no more sing-alongs in bars behaving like a tramp.
my mother taught me to sing along like that.
I told you that.
she used to dance around the kitchen when I was a little girl, singing goofy songs to me.
I was gonna teach our daughter the same thing one day.
I don't think we want the same things anymore, do we, Zip?
I think you should go.
I knew as soon as I saw those photos. She was good.
I just couldn't admit to it at the time.
you couldn't handle that she was more talented than you.
instead, I was cruel.
and that was the last time I saw her.
I went to Monty's studio that night to get my prints of Rita.
I knew they'd be valuable someday.
took me all night to pack 'em up.
anyone to back that up?
Betty Sue was there. Trying on some of Rita's wardrobe for her date.
Betty Sue borrowed Rita's clothes?
well, the kid didn't have any money.
do you remember if she took a purse? - A purse?
for her date. Did she borrow a purse?
I don't know.
she was awful excited, though. She, uh, made me take a picture of her.
you still have that picture?
I'm a photographer. Got a negative of every picture I ever took.
dig it up and print it.
Betty Sue dresses for a night on the town.
you remember when that photo was taken?
I don't know.
it's at the studio.
must have been a photo shoot.
Oh, Zip said he took it the night Rita was killed. - He did?
you were at the studio getting ready for your big date.
Oh, well, I'll be. I'd forgotten.
you forgot a lot, Betty.
I been going over these pinup magazines
you chose seems like a time capsule.
Rita's night on the town outfit for your date with Blue Eyes.
quite a trip down memory lane.
but what does that have to do with Rita's murder?
everything.
you see that purse?
you had it with you on your date.
so how does it end up in Rita's apartment?
I just figured Rita borrowed it from wardrobe.
maybe she did. - No. No.
the only way that purse gets to this crime scene is if you brought it.
I did stop by.
but I didn't hurt Rita.
I ran your fingerprints, Betty.
matches the gun.
how did you get my fingerprints?
a report from the crime lab.
and your prints are all over your office at St. Mary's.
patriot Act. Special subpoena. We dusted that place two nights ago.
I didn't have a gun.
you were Monty's assistant.
you had copies of all his keys.
the strip club was a dangerous place.
you took Monty's gun for protection.
Oh, that gun. Yes, I had it.
I don't know how it got to Rita's apartment.
well, your date ended early, so you went to Rita's to talk about it.
just like she made you promise.
your date was at 8: 00.
the gunshot was heard at 9: 00.
your date didn't go well, did it?
a couple drinks to numb the pain?
two best friends, both working the soda shop.
years pass and everything goes right for one, but the other one...
she's stuck taking care of a drunken old man.
and Rita plays and dances.
everything was easy for her.
I just wanted one day of her luck.
one day when it was easy.
what happened that night, Betty?
I've devoted my life to helping others.
helping others or seeking atonement?
I hope so.
Betty? What's wrong?
you told me to come by after the date.
here I am.
sit down, Bets. You don't look too good.
what's that?
nothing.
it's just another picture I took.
it's of you.- Self-portrait.
Monty found another magazine that wants to publish me.
I had to come up with a fake name.
stanley Nopell. Get it?
from your song.
good one.
what's a girl gotta do to get a drink around here?
Hey, hey, haven't you had enough?
Betty, what happened?
my date went real swell.
sat down for drinks.
he was excited...
a little nervous.
then you know happened?
he gave me something.
he did?
well what did he give you? - This.
he wanted your autograph.
he only asked me out so he could meet you.
no. No, that can't be true.
he came to you that night.
because he was too nervous to go to you.
he laughed at me when he realized I thought we were on a date.
Oh, Betty.
what's it like...to always be lucky?
Betty, I'm not lucky.
harder I work, luckier I get.
the men at the club-- they stare, stare.
they never ask me for my autograph.
they ask me for other things.
Betty, you don't have to do that.
come stay here with me.
your dad'll be fine.
if I can't make old Blue Eyes happy, then you should.
you make everyone happy!
life's funny.
ain't it, koo koo?
go ahead. Sign it!
Betty, don't do this.
sign it!
sign it!
Betty, it's me.
it's Ree. I'm your friend.
things can change for you.
I started right where you did.
that's what hurts the most.
you okay? - I'm fine, mate. Don't worry about it.
you all right?
enjoy L. A.
he did it.
Everthing's always about you. - It's not.
that gearhead was being sarcastic and you know it.
I just didn't see it that way. - Bullshit.
what about the dig about the makeover?
what do you want me to do? I work with him, for chrissake.
you're capable of taking care of your own shit.
you know something? Last time I checked, you were sleeping with me.
so unless you want to start fucking him, I suggest...
Hey, pal. Where can I catch a shuttle to the airport around here?
right there. - Thanks.
it was him in that gold Lexus with the cell phone.
are they still asking for a change of venue?
he's enhanceable because of priors in the early '80s.
where to? - Downtown. 31 2 North Spring Street.
downtown.
look, the transcriptions need to be done by 7 a. m. period, okay?
hold on. Take Sepulveda to Slauson to La Brea.
take La Brea north to 6th, into downtown.
so what? You'll be up late.
I'm pulling an all-nighter too, so save the tears.
I'll take 105 east to the 110. It's faster. - What?
the 105 to the 110 will get you there quicker.
the 110 turns into a parking lot around USC.
but once you get to La Brea north of Santa Monica, it's jammed.
the 110 north of the 10, you get people driving to Pasadena and they drive slow.
Yeah, they do, but what I do is I get off on Grand and then l...
surface roads is what you want, that's what we'll do.
are we taking bets?
are we? - And what if you're wrong?
I don't think I'll be wrong, but if I am...
...your ride's free.
okay, you got yourself a deal.
go ahead, say it. - Say what?
go ahead. - I got lucky with the lights.
you weren't lucky. What you were was right.
I was wrong...
...Max.
you mind turning that up?
you like the classics.
I do. I used to play in high school. - Let me guess. Woodwinds.
no. Strings. Never had the lungs for wind instruments.
could've fooled me the way you were unloading on that cell phone.
different instrument.
if you had just listened to me, we'd be all bogged down in traffic right now, and you would've made an extra five bucks.
Yeah, well, you keep that 5 bucks. Buy you something special. Go wild.
really, it's not a big deal. Nothing big here.
how many cabbies do you know get you into an argument to save you money?
there were two of us. I had to kill the other one.
I don't like competition.
take pride in being good at what you do?
what, this? No, this is part-time.
this is a fill-in job. Pay the bills.
but I will be the best at what I do. But that's something else.
what else? - Just shaping up some things.
like...?
tell me.
limo company I'm putting together. Island Limos.
it'll be like a island on wheels. A cool groove, like a club experience.
when you get to the airport, you won't want to get out of my limo.
so I do this part-time to get my Benz off leases...
staff up, get the right client list. You know, things like that.
how do you like being a lawyer?
what are you, psychic? - Little bit.
there's the dark pinstripe suit.
elegant, not too flashy. That rules out advertising.
plus a top-drawer briefcase that you live out of.
and the purse. A Bottega.
anyway, a man gets in my cab with a sword, I figure he's a sushi chef.
you?
Clarence Darrow.
well, no, not quite. He worked defense. I'm a prosecutor.
big case? - Yeah.
got us here fast. - Of course.
but you didn't answer my question.
you like what you do?
Yeah.
but not today.
no, I do. Like, I can't wait.
I love standing in that courtroom.
at the same time, I get this clenched up thing the night before the first days.
clenched up? How?
I think I'm going to lose.
I think the case sucks, my exhibits aren't in order,
I'm not prepared enough, people will find out I don't know what I'm doing and I've been running a charade all these years.
I represent the Department of Justice, and my opening statement will fall flat at the most important point and the jury will laugh at me.
and then I cry. I don't throw up.
a lot of people throw up. I have a strong stomach.
and then I pull myself together, I rewrite my opening statement...
work my exhibits and that's what I do for the rest of the night.
that's my routine.
in the morning it starts and I'm fine.
you need a vacation.
I just had a vacation on the Harbor Freeway.
not in a cab. You need to get your head straight.
get your unified self up. Get harmonic, you know...
when did you last take a break? - I go on vacation all the time.
how often? - A dozen times a day.
my favorite spot:
maldives lslands.
it's my own private getaway.
things get heavy for me, I take five minutes out and I just go there.
and I just concentrate on absolutely nothing.
here. Take it. - I couldn't do that.
take it because you need it a lot more than I do.
and it'll help you. I guarantee it.
Thanks, Max.
go get 'em.
Hey.
I don't know...
in case you ever want to investigate a Fortune 500 company, or argue cab routes.
Hey.
come on, man, I'm sorry.
I didn't hear you, man. Come on.
I'll take you.
where to? - 1039 South Union Street.
gotcha.
how long you think this'll take? - Seven minutes.
seven. Not eight? Not six?
two minutes from the 110 to Normandie. Normandie to Venice, three minutes.
over to Union is one, plus one for "shit happens.
okay if I time you? - Knock yourself out.
what do I get if you're wrong? A free ride?
an apology. Already offered my free ride today.
to who? - Some girl.
did you get a date with her?
first time in L. A?
no. Tell you the truth, whenever I'm here I can't wait to leave.
it's too sprawled out, disconnected. You know? That's me.
you like it? - It's my home.
17 million people.
it's the fifth biggest economy in the world and nobody knows each other.
I read about this guy gets on the MTA here, dies.
Oh.
six hours he rides the subway before anyone notices his corpse doing laps around L. A. people on and off sitting next to him.
nobody notices.
this is the cleanest cab I've ever been in.
regular ride?
Yeah, I share it with the day shift guy.
you prefer nights?
people are more relaxed. Less stress, less traffic, better tips.
how are the benefits? - It's not that kind of job.
I'm not in this for the long haul. Just filling in.
temporary while I get some things shaped up.
this is just temporary.
how long you been driving? - 12 years.
Really?
what other things you putting together?
um...
you know, I don't want to talk about it. Just a little business plan.
no offense. I just... - None taken.
you're one of these guys that do instead of talk.
that's cool.
seven minutes. Man, you're good.
I got lucky with the lights. - Yeah, sure.
you probably know the light schedules too.
listen, I'm in town on a real estate deal, close in one night.
I got five stops to make.
collect signatures, see some friends, and then I got a 6 a. m. out of LAX.
why don't you hang with me? - The car's not for hire. Against regs.
regulations?
they don't pay you sick leave. How much you pull down a shift?
how much? - 350, 400.
well, let me tell you what, I'll make it 600.
man, I don't know.
an extra 1 00 you get me to LAX and I don't run for the plane.
I don't know about this. - Yeah, you do.
I don't know, man. - Yeah, you do.
600... - Cool. We got a deal.
now, here's 300 down. What's your name?
Max. - Max, I'm Vincent.
all right.
I can't stay double-parked here.
I'll meet you in the alley behind the building.
definitely not from around here.
there you go.
Oh, no! Shit!
what the hell?!
damn it!
my man, you all right?
Oh, shit. Fuck.
he fell on the cab.
he fell from up there on the motheefucking cab.
shit. I think he's dead.
good guess.
you killed him?
no, I shot him. Bullets and the fall killed him.
fuck this, man.
red light, Max. - Hold on.
put your hands down.
put your hands down. - OK.
help me out. Pop the trunk. - What?
pop the trunk.
come on, man. - Move.
come on. What you doing?
we're going to roll him off the roof.
can't leave him here, so unless you want him up front with you, - but given the hygiene. - Oh, shit.
it's only a dead guy.
grab his hands.
I can't do this. - Grab his wrists.
you got it? - He's twitching and shit.
okay. That's good enough.
let's go.
why don't you just take the cab?
take the cab? - You take it.
I'll chill. I'll just chill.
they don't know who drives these half the time.
they never check. Okay, so just take it.
you, me...
you promise not to tell anybody, right? - Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
promise.
get in the fucking car.
get in the car.
Ramone?
Ramone?
fuck.
rampart Watch Commander, - This is Detective Fanning, Narcotics.

Roger, 1039 South Union, - What are you doing? - I got to clean up. This is a mess.
lady Macbeth, we're sitting here and the light's green. Leave the seats.
asshole!
you no longer have the cleanest cab in La-La Land.
you got to live with that. You focus on the job. Drive.
7565 Fountain. You know it?
west Hollywood. - How long you figure?
I don't know, 1 7 minutes.
Why?
Oh, no. Hold on, man.
I told you we had other stops tonight. - You said you had to visit friends.
they're somebody's friends.
you drive a cab, I make my rounds.
you might make it through the night, come out 700 bucks ahead.
I'm not trying to piss you off, but I can't drive you around while you kill people. It ain't my job.
tonight it is.
look, you don't get it.
I mean it.
l... I'm not up for this.
you're stressed. - Yes, I am.
you're stressed. I understand that.
now, you just keep breathing and stay calm.
are you breathing? - Shit.
are you breathing? Okay, good. - Yes.
here's the deal.
you were going to drive me tonight and never be the wiser, but el gordo got in front of a window, did his high dive...
we're into plan B. You still breathing?
we gotta make the best of it. Improvise. Adapt to the environment.
Darwin. Shit happens. I Ching.
whatever. We got to roll with it.
l Ching"? You threw a man out of a window.
I didn't throw him. He fell.
well, what did he do to you? - What?
what did he do to you? - Nothing. I only met him tonight.
you just met him once and you kill him?
I should only kill people after I get to know them?
no, man. - Six billion people on the planet, and you're bent out of shape because of one fat guy.
who was he? - What do you care?
have you ever heard of Rwanda? - Yes, I know Rwanda.
tens of thousands killed before sundown.
nobody's killed people that fast since Nagasaki and Hiroshima.
did you bat an eye, Max? - What?
did you join Amnesty lnternational or Oxfam?
save the Whale, Greenpeace or something? No.
I off one fat Angeleno and you throw a hissy fit.
I don't know any Rwandans.
you don't know the guy in that trunk either.
man.
if it makes you feel better, he was a criminal involved in a continuing criminal enterprise.
what, you just taking out the garbage?
something like that.
pull over to the right, - Shit.
get rid of them. - How?
you're a cabby. Talk yourself out of a ticket.
please, don't do anything. - Then don't let me get cornered.
you don't have trunk space. - I can't believe this.
believe it. - Don't. I'll talk to them.
a domestic disturbance, No additional units needed,

I'll take care of it. I got it.

Yeah, over on...
I was on Slauson. - A South Central deer?
they out there. It ran right in front of the car and I couldn't avoid it.
why you still carrying a passenger?
I'm on my way to the depot and I could just drop him. His drop is on my way.
your cab's unsafe to drive and we have to impound it.
we got to do a vehicle inventory.
pop the trunk and step out the vehicle. Sir, you'll have to call another cab.
is that necessary? I'm half a mile from here.
I'm afraid it is. Step out the vehicle. You too. Come on.
if you open that trunk, they go inside. - You know what, it's been a long night.
Plus, the barn is right up there. Just give me a break.
this is my first fare.
get out the cab. Open the trunk.
step out. You too, sir. Please.

how do I not get excited, listening to you try to extort a working man?

I was just, - Tell it to him.

and next time you pull any shit...
I'll have to stick this yellow cab up your fat ass.
crazy.
shit!
when a man wants his wife back or a boyfriend-girlfriend thing,
we hear, "Get your protective order,
a protective order's a tool we use, but often times it's just a piece of paper to the stalker, - Mr, Clarke, there 's a notary here, - Did he identify himself as a notary?
Yes, he did,
all right, sure, send him up.
or shoots them? That happens too often,
but we use it as a tool,
I say a lot of times, in this situation strangers may write or call,
but how often, in fact, are stalkers people that the recipient of those affections knows?
Hey, I'm in the cab!
Hey!
shit. Down here in the alley!
shit.
Hey, hold up.
Oh, man, yeah.
Yeah, right there. I'm in the cab, man, I'm stuck.
thank you. Thank you.
Hey, look, I got to get out of here.
what's up? What's going on?
this guy tied me up, but he's in this building, doing wild shit.
I need to get out of here. - You all tied up in there, huh?
get me out so we can call the cops. - Give me your wallet.
are you kidding me? - Do I look like I'm kidding you?
listen, don't you see that my hands are tied to the steering wheel?
I don't care what they're tied to. I'll fuck you up.
don't shoot, man. - Then get your ass up.
fuck.
what the fuck else you got in here? Jackpot.
Thanks, for real. Bop!
yo, homey.
that my briefcase? - This yours?
Yeah, it is. Why, you want it back?
how about your wallet?
what else you got for me, huh?
fuck!
Where's the button? Under the dash?
mind getting it?
you attract attention, you're going to get people killed who didn't need to be.
you understand?
Yeah. - Yeah?
but, hey, new news...
we're ahead of schedule.
like jazz? - Sorry. What?
jazz. You like jazz?
not that much.
guy told me about this place off Crenshaw.
Leimert Park. All the West Coast greats played there.
Dexter Gordon, Charlie Mingus, Chet Baker. Like that.
come on, finish up. I'll buy you a drink.
what's your informant's name? Ramone?
Ramone Ayala. Supposed to meet him in Bellflower last night.
he doesn't show up, I roll here, find this.
how long you been working this guy? - Four months. He's a low-level player.
part of a distribution network that hooks up to Felix.
Felix Reyes-Torrena?
feds are all over him, don't want us anywhere near it.
since when's LAPD working for the Feeb?
they'll just take our stuff, build their case, take the credit.
what's the point? - The point is my guy flew out a window.
so if my Cl flies out a window, he's got Felix's handprints on his ass.
that makes it mine.
is there a crime here? A homicide? You got a body?
just a bunch of broken glass. - And blood.
down here, in the glass. Here's some more.
and there's some spatter patterns over there and over here.
Richard? - Yeah, it's me.
Ramone went through that window... splat.
glass here, then tires rolled over it.
maybe he jumped.
sure. He's depressed so he jumps four stories out of a window onto his head.
that feels better" Picks himself up."
now I think I'll go on with the rest of my day
come on, man. - Hey, Ray!
catch.
recent? - You can still smell the cordite.
old guy across the alley watching TV says he saw a cab earlier tonight - with two guys walking around the hood. - Description? He see anything?
kind of saw. Guy's got glasses like Coke bottles.
there are 4, 000 taxicabs in L. A. County. You got anything else?
that's it.
okay. Keep knocking. Let's keep knocking.
remember that Bay Area deal? Oakland?
cabby drove around all night, killed three people, - then put the gun to his head. - He flipped out. So what?
so that Oakland detective never bought it.
cabby had no criminal record or history of mental illness.
pops three people, then himself?
anyway, that detective always thought there was someone else in that cab.
I never learned to listen to jazz.
it's off melody. Behind the notes. Not what's expected.
lmprovising, like tonight. - Like tonight?
most people, ten years from now, same job, place, routine. Everthhing the same.
just keeping it safe over and over. Ten years from now.
man, you don't know where you'll be ten minutes from now.
do you?
who is that on the trumpet?
that's Daniel, baby, he's the owner.
he's terrific. Would you be so kind as to invite him over after his set?
I got to buy him a drink. - Sure thing, darling.
now see, I was about 1 9, bussing tables right here.
the money wasn't shit, but that wasn't the point.
it was about being around the music. And I was.
take this one night. July 22nd, 1 964. Who you think walks through that door?
Bye, baby.
miles Davis. That's right. - In the flesh?
I'm talking about through those doors, the coolest man on the planet.
Jesus.
anyway, he had been recording a session up at Columbia, up on Vine.
so Miles comes through that door.
before you know it, he's up on the bandstand, jamming with the band.
I mean, it had to be...
Oh, it was scary. I mean, the dude was so focused, man.
Plus, he was kind of a scary cat anyway.
everybody and their mama knew you don't just come up and talk to Miles Davis.
I mean, he may have looked like he was chilling, but he was absorbed.
this one young, hip couple, one of them tried to shake his hand one day.
and the guy says, "Hi, my name is.
miles said, "Get out of my face, you jive motheefucker.
take your silly bitch with you
you know? That was Miles, man.
that's the way he was when he was in his musical headspace. Fierce.
but did you get to talk to him? - Better than that.
I played for about 20 minutes.
unbelievable.
how'd you do? - How'd I do?
you really ain't shit playing next to Miles Davis.
but he carried my ass.
What'd he say?
he said one word: Cool.
cool?
that's it? - Yeah.
that meant, "Good, but not ready
it meant, "Look me up when you are
did you?
no. I got drafted and got into some other things.
and by the time I got back to music, season had passed.
you know, I was born in 1 945, but that night was the moment of my conception.
right here in this room. - Crowd's not here now.
well, jazz ain't the draw that it used to be.
what a great story.
I got to tell the people in Culiacan and Cartagena that story.
you know the folks in Culiacan and Cartagena?
afraid so.
just when I thought you were a cool guy.
I am a cool guy with a job I contracted to do.
come on, give the dude a pass. - I'm working here.
you're the one talking about improvisation.
you like the guy, how he plays. Let's just play a little jazz.
Improvi... That's funny coming from you.
how's this?
I'll ask a question. - What question?
a jazz question.
now, you get it right, we roll.
you disappear tonight.
if I walk out of here tonight,
I will go so far away, it'll be just like I was dead.
and one more thing: These people and their rep here, Felix...
well, you tell them I'm sorry.
you tell them I had to. They laid a grant of immunity on me.
it was either play ball or go back inside.
and I'm not going back inside.
Yeah.
lay it on me.
where did Miles learn music?
I know everthhing about Miles. - Then let's have it.
music school. He got into music school, right?
his father was a dentist, east St. Louis.
invested in agriculture, made plenty of money.
he sent Miles to Juilliard School of Music, New York, 1 945.
man.
dropped out in less than a year, tracked down Charlie Parker on 52nd Street who mentored him for the next three years.
Hey.
no, I'm done. Find you another cab. - Max.
leave me alone. I'm collateral, anyway.
I am not playing.
you played him, man.
he got the answer right...
...would you have let him go?
102, Max,
what is it with this guy?
you hassling my driver again? - Who are you?
the same guy you talked to last time.
Max's mother's driving me crazy, put him on the line, please,
hang on.
carefully.
yeah?
your mother's calling, "Why didn't you show?
are you all right? Where are you? - Show for what?
tell her I can't make it tonight.
I'm not related to you, Tell her yourself,
show up for what?
she's in the hospital.
you visit every night? - Yeah. What's the difference?
you don't show up, it breaks routine. - So?
so people start looking for you, this cab. That's not good.
I'm not taking you to see my mother.
since when was any of this negotiable.
two paces ahead, one to the left.
flowers?
it's a waste of money. Won't mean a thing to her.
she carried you in her womb for nine months.
people buy flowers. Buy flowers.
excuse me.
keep the change.
hold that elevator, please.
floor? - Five. Thanks.
having a good night? - Mezzo mezzo,
you?
excuse me.
Hey, Ma.
I've been calling and calling.
I got caught up at work. - Why couldn't you call me?
I'm lying here wondering if something terrible happened to you.
I brought you flowers. - What am I gonna do with flowers?
cheer up. - How?
by worrying that you spend money on stuff that's just going to wilt and die?
see what I mean?
I didn't buy you the flowers. He did.
who?
why didn't you tell me we had company?
what's your name? Sorry my son is rude.
no harm done, ma'am.
you paid for my flowers?
they're beautiful.
well, Max?
mother, this is Vincent. Vincent, this is my mother, lda.
I am very happy to meet you, Mrs. Durocher.
Oh, just call me lda.
Ida. I was with Max when he got the call.
you came here to see me? - It's nothing, ma'am.
tell my son.
you have to hold a gun to his head to make him do anything.
you must be one of Max's important clients.
client? You know, I like to think of myself as his friend.
Max never had many friends.
always talking to himself in the mirror. It's unhealthy.
how many times I got to ask don't do that?
do what?
don't talk about me like I'm not right here in the room here.
what's he saying?
he says he's standing right here in the room here.
Yes, you are. He's sensitive.
I know. But I'm sure you're very proud of him.
of course I'm proud. He started with nothing, you know?
look at him today. Here, Vegas...
mom, he is not interested in hearing about all that, okay?
I came to see you, I saw you, you look good, let's go.
I am very interested, lda. Please.
limousine companies. - Is that right?
he drives famous people around.
famous people. Limousine companies.
now, that's quite an achievement.
what did you say your name was? - My name's Vincent, ma'am.
visit again?
no, I'm just in town tonight.
when you come back. - Sure.
Max!
don't!
all my prep was in there. You are screwing with my work.
let's see what else you can do.
well, I've had four come in tonight. Maybe one's your guy.
no, not Ramone. Let's see this one.
no, next.
there's something funny about this, though.
these three all came in within half an hour of each other, right?
the kid and that last guy, both done by the same shooter, I think.
why do you say that?
wound pattern.
two in the sternum, one in the head.
this guy is shooting tight groups too, all right? Check this out.
double taps are a couple millimeters apart.
let's see this one.
see what I mean?
holy shit.
can I use your phone?
come on, come on, wake up.
hello.
it's Fanning. I'm still down here at the morgue at Sisters of Charity.
John Does didn't pan out, but you'll never guess who's in the meat locker.
who?
Sylvester Clarke, criminal attorney turned lawyer criminal.
including Ramone, who he represented, who's still missing,
both are in the exotic substances business together.
there's something going on, and I don't think the feds know about it.
stay on your cell phone. I got the ASAC's phone.
I'll hook up with you in 30 minutes.
good.
going to a place called El Rodeo. It's on Washington Boulevard, Pico Rivera.
where at on Washington? - Look it up.
limos, huh?
don't start.
I'm not the one lying to my mother.
she hears what she wants to hear. I don't disillusion her.
right. Maybe she hears what you tell her.
whatever I tell her's never good enough. It's always been that way.
so, what's at El Rodeo?
just drive.
they project onto you their flaws.
what they don't like about themselves, their lives, whatever.
they rank on you instead.
how do you know?
I had a father like that.
mothers are worse. - Wouldn't know.
my mother died before I remember her.
what happened to your father?
hated everthhing I did.
got drunk, beat me up, foster homes. Went back with him. Like that.
then what?
I killed him.
I was 1 2.
I'm kidding.
he died of liver disease.
well, I'm sorry.
no, you're not.
so, what is this "driving a cab temporarily" It's all bullshit?
it is not bullshit.
1 2 years isn't temporary.
got to get the cash together. Insurance, bonds, maintenance, tires.
got to staff up, get the right client list.
it's not just get the car and put asses in the seats.
why not?
because lsland Limos is more than just a ride.
it's like a club experience. Cool groove.
don't want it to end.
it's got to be perfect.
Peefect.
it's up here. Turn right.
give me your wallet. Come on.
give me your wallet. Come on.
give you my wallet. For what?
I'll hold it for you in case the people inside search you.
who's searching? - The people inside.
go in, ask for Felix. He's expecting you.
Felix. What does he look like? - I don't know, I never met him.
who is he?
he's connected to the guys who hired me.
I don't get it.
you destroyed my work-ups. Number four is due.
What'd you think, night's over? Called on account of rain?
go in there, say you're me. Score the backups.
they'll be on flash drive or CD. - How come you don't...
I don't meet people. Anonymity. I protect mine.
you're not going to screw that up. Contract's with their bosses.
these guys don't meet me, or know what I look like.
if I don't pull it off, then...
they will kill you. You got 1 0 minutes.
at 1 0: 01, I execute your mother on my way out of town.
don't pretend indifference. - I can't do this.
I can't. - Sure you can. Come on. Hey, hey.
if I do this, I'm just going to end up getting people killed.
out of options. Take comfort in knowing you never had a choice.
how long you been doing this? - Why?
just in case they ask me.
private sector? Six years. - Okay. All right. Six years.
you get benefits? Or, you know, insurance? Pension?
no. No paid sick leave. Quit stalling, get out of the cab.
hold on, man.
who's this?
mark the time.
all right, he's clean.
what's up, Holmes?
I'm here to see Felix. He has something for me.
don't know no Felix.
tell him...
say it's Vincent.
I'm Vincent.
copy.
let him in. Let him in right now.
detective Richard Weidner, LAPD, Major Narcotics Division.
detective Ray Fanning... - OK, how are you? Agent Frank Pedrosa.
thanks for seeing us. - How can I help?
why do you want to know about our case?
any unusual activity tonight? - Like what?
that relates to a series of murders in Wilshire Central or West Hollywood?
all quiet on the western front.
various people are asleep. Various people are not.
they come and go in cars, pickups, taxis.
other than that, we watch air move.
your interest in our case? - We got a situation. Two bodies.
could be a coincidence, could not be a coincidence.
it doesn't look like one. We got an attorney and his client...
roof's all beat to shit.
roof's all beat to shit.
can you zoom in on this? - On what?
on that.
look at that right there. - What is it?
Yeah.
I thought you'd be taller.
so, Vincent...
what are the two names? - Ramone Ayala and Clarke.
Ramone Ayala and Clarke were murdered tonight? Both killed?
clarke for sure. Ramone, I don't know. - I got another D.O.A.
Daniel Baker out of South Central, Leimert Park.
that's three.
three what? - Witnesses.
Vincent meets their people in Culiacan or Cartagena.
but he don't meet you. OK.
now you're here.
Why?
I lost my stuff.
the list.
I want you to listen to me real well.
special groups put together the list of dedos.
dedos. - Fingers. Informants.
signal interceptions with voice-recognition software, surveillance.
a very expensive counterintelligence worked up that list.
an important list. Wouldn't you say?
and you lost it?
Yeah. I'm sorry.
sorry.
sorry? "Sorry" does not put Humpty Dumpty back together again.
do you believe in Humpty Dumpty? - No.
do you believe in Santa Claus? - No.
nor do l.
nor do l, but my children do. They are still small.
but do you know who they like even better than Santa Claus? His helper.
black Peter.
there's an old Mexican tale that tells of how Santa Claus got so busy looking out for the good children, that he had to hire some help to look out for the bad children.
so he hired Pedro.
and Santa Claus gave him a list with all the names of all the bad children.
and Pedro would come every night to check them out.
and the people, the little kids that were misbehaving, that were not saying their prayers,
Pedro would leave a little toy donkey on their windows.
a little burro, and he would come back.
if they were still misbehaving, Pedro would take them away and nobody would ever see them again.
now, if I am being Santa Claus, and you are Pedro, how do you think jolly old Santa Claus would feel if one day Pedro came into his office and said, "l lost the list"?
how fucking furious do you think he will get?
tell me, Vincent.
tell me what you think.
what?
I think...
I think you should tell the guy...behind me...
...to put that gun down.
what did you say?
I said you should tell the guy behind me to put his gun away before I take it and beat his bitch ass to death with it.
I picked up a tail.
federal? - I don't know, you tell me.
that's why I tossed the list.
the work-ups, all of that shit.
to protect, in part...
your Hermes Faconnable ass.
you think I like coming in here?
but, hey...
...shit happens.
got to roll with it. Adapt.
Darwin. I Ching.
the fat man, the penthouse guy, the jazz man.
that leaves two.
can you finish?
in six years...
...when have I not?
say it's Vincent.
I'm Vincent.
say it's Vincent.
I'm Vincent.
say it's Vincent.
I'm Vincent.
Vincent? - That's what I'm hearing.
I'm Vincent.
your last two.
and by the way, as a token of my appreciation
I would like to offer you a discount.
for all my services, 25 percent.
very generous.
hell, make it 35.
and by the way...
Daniel said he was sorry.
interesting.
e-mail me his license.
to my cell phone.
no, no, I'll wait.
is there anybody else in that cab?
Vegas odds would've been against you walking out of there.
Yeah, I'm very impressive.
sixth Street by Alexandria, a club called Fever. You know it?
locate our witness, Peter Lim. Get him evacuated and safe.
l. A. 1 01 to chase units.
african American, medium build.
the assault team will do the takedown. Do not spook him before.
I want air support to maintain at 1 500 feet.
thank you.
how long? - 1 2 minutes.
according to the cab's dispatch unit, he's been driving that cab for 1 2 years.
so what?
you're telling me the guy walks into a phone booth and changes into a meat-eater super assassin?
what's he do, squeeze them in between fares?
the real driver is floating down a storm drain.
the guy who walked out looks like this.
he picked a driver who looks like him. - I don't know.
I do. Zee?
we see private-sector security companies hiring out to cartels in Colombia, Russia, Mexico, hiring ex-Special Forces, Stasi, ex-KGB, like that, all the time.
guys with trigger time, skill sets, tradecraft, look like a cab driver.
what are you going to do?
take his ass down. Save our witness.
what if they're wrong?
the guy's admitting his name is Vincent. He's in there talking to the bad guys.
there is something else going on. - There's nothing.
I thought there was, there isn't. It's their ball, their game.
there's nothing in it for us. - Nothing for you.
it's late, I'm going home. You know what time it is?
they locate Peter Lim?
the wife thinks he's at Fever. - Sixth and Alexandria. Move it.
l. A. 1 01 to L. A. 1 03, L. A. 1 05, L. A. 1 08.
witness is at Fever, Sixth and Alexandria.
that's where Vincent is going.
assault team and remaining unit, take Vincent.
first unit on the scene will get the witness out.
l. A. 1 05 to L. A. 1 01. We copy that.
you going to call her? - Who?
your lady friend. The one who gave you her business card.
I don't know. Maybe, maybe not.
what?
pick up the phone.
life's short. One day it's gone.
you and I make it out of this alive, you should call her.
that's what I think.
anyway...
there he is. Hit it.
let's do it.
the table towards the back is where he hangs.
Wilke, take the right. Brian, hold the door.
clean shots. Watch your backgrounds.
move 1 5 feet ahead, three feet left.
wander, innocent bystanders get the first rounds. Clear?
there's Lim. Second booth from the left. Get him out.
middle of the dance floor. Freeze, Vincent!
FBl! FBl! Get your hands in the air! Get your hands in the air, Vincent!
this is the FBI! Hands in the air!
FBI. Where's Peter Lim?
drop it!
Freeze!
I'm not Vincent. - FBl!
yo, put the gun down! You got the wrong...
Pedrosa's been shot. Get an RA unit.
wait, wait!
hold on. I'm Detective Fanning.
I'm Max! I'm a goddamn cab driver, man! I'm a goddamn cab driver.
I know. I'm getting you out of here. I'm LAPD. Come on.
how'd you find me? - You're okay. Just move it.
keep moving.
you're OK, you're OK.
you're OK. You're all right.
let's go!
let's go.
go! Drive! Drive!
only thing didn't show up was the Polish cavalry.
you're alive. I saved you.
do I get any thanks? No. All you can do is clam up.
you want to talk? Tell me to fuck off?
fuck off.
you had to kill Fanning?
who the fuck is Fanning? - Fanning, the cop.
why'd you have to kill him?
he's probably got a family. Kids will grow up without him.
he believed me.
I should've saved him because he believed you.
not that. - Yeah. That.
what's wrong with that?
it's what I do for a living. - Some living.
head downtown. - What's downtown?
how are you at math? I was hired for five hits. I did four.
why didn't you just kill me and get another cab driver?
you're good. We're in this together. Fates intertwined. Cosmic coincidence.
you full of shit. - I'm full of shit?
you even bullshitted yourself, if all I am is taking out garbage, killing bad people.
that's what you said. - You believe me?
then what'd they do? - How do I know?
they all got that "witness for the prosecution" look to me.
probably some major federal indictment of somebody who majorly does not want to get indicted.
so that's the reason?
that's the "why." There's no reason.
there's no good or bad reason to live or to die.
then what are you?
indifferent.
get with it.
millions of galaxies of hundreds of millions of stars and a speck on one in a blink.
that's us. Lost in space.
the cop, you, me...
who notices?
what's with you?
as in?
as in if somebody had a gun to your head and said:
you got to tell me what's going on with this person over here or I'll kill you.
what is driving him? What was he thinking?
you know, you couldn't do it, could you, because they'd have to kill your ass because you don't know what anyone else is thinking.
I think you're low, my brother. Way low.
like, what were you? One of those institutionalized raised guys?
anybody home?
the standard parts that are supposed to be there in people, in you aren't.
and why haven't you killed me yet?
of all the cabbies in L. A. I get Max.
sigmund Freud meets Dr. Ruth.
answer the question.
look in the mirror.
paper towels, clean cab, limo company someday.
how much you got saved? - That ain't none of your business.
someday? Someday my dream will come?
one night you'll wake up and you'll discover it never happened.
it's all turned around on you.
it never will.
suddenly you are old.
didn't happen. And it never will because you were never going to do it anyway.
you'll push it into memory, then zone out in your Barcalounger, being hypnotized by daytime TV for the rest of your life.
don't you talk to me about murder.
all it ever took was a down payment on a Lincoln Town Car.
or that girl. You can't even call that girl.
what the fuck are you still doing driving a cab?
because I never straightened up and looked at it, you know?
myself. I should have.
I tried to gamble my way out from under, but that was just a born-to-lose deal.
slow down. - It's got to be perfect.
it's got to be perfect to go. Risk all torqued down.
I could've done it anytime I wanted to.
red light.
but you know what? New news.
it doesn't matter anyway. What does it matter anyway?
we're all insignificant out here in this big-ass nowhere.
twilight Zone shit.
says the badass sociopath in my back seat.
but you know what? That's the one thing I got to thank you for, bro.
because until now, I never looked at it that way.
what does it matter? It don't, so fuck it. Fix it.
what do we got to lose anyway, right?
slow down.
Why? You going to pull the trigger and kill us?
go ahead, shoot my ass. - Slow the hell down.
you going to shoot me now? You going to kill us?
well, shoot my ass then. Shoot me.
slow down! - You're right.
you know what, Vincent?
go fuck yourself!
well, that was brilliant.
didn't have your seat belt on?
1 L-20, show me code six at Olympic and Figueroa on a TC with injuries.
copy your location.
are you okay? What happened?
sir, you were involved in an accident.
an ambulance is on its way to help you. You understand what I'm saying?
sit down and relax, okay?
okay. Don't worry about the cab. They'll get you a new one.
relax and breathe.
put your hands up!
put your hands up. Face the cab. Get down on your knees!
arrest me. - Hands on your head.
take me to jail. L. A. County's great.
don't move! Put your hands behind your head.
1 L-20, I need a backup on a 1 87 suspect.
Ah!
put the gun down!
put your hands down! Look, I got to go.
stop moving! Stop moving!
when did this become a negotiation?
cuff your hands together. Hold your hands together.
listen, somebody's going to get killed if I don't go right now.
now, cuff yourself.
I'm going to Sixth and Fig. Call the cops.
give me that.
Hey, hey! Whoa! Fuck.
shit!
come on!
come on. Go through.
come on. Come on. Pick up.
pick up.
come on, girl.
come on, pick up.
u. S. Attorney's Office. - Annie! It's Max.
Max, the cab driver.
listen to me, all right? A guy named Vincent...
listen to me, Annie.
it's kind of a strange time to be calling.
listen. There's a man named Vincent. He's coming to kill you.
he's what? - Kill you! He's coming to kill you!
he was scoping out the building when I dropped you off...
if this is supposed to be some type of joke, it's not funny.
it's not a joke. Listen to me, please.
Felix hired him. Okay? Or people that Felix worked for.
Felix Reyes-Torrena. How do you know about my case?
I don't understand.
all I know is he's already killed witnesses. He's coming to kill you.
when I dropped you off, I don't know how, but he ended up in my cab.
Annie...
Annie, listen. All I want you to do...
I don't understand. - Listen. Please listen.
get out of the building. Annie.
I'm leaving the building now. - No, wait.
Max. - Wait, wait.
Max. - Where are you? What floor?
I'm on the 1 6th floor. I'm in the Law Library and Files.
he's two floors below you, corner office.
in my office?
he does not know you're there. Stay there and call 91 1.
are you sure he's on the 1 4th floor?
just stay there and just call the police.
Max.
shit.
Max.

Max. - He knows you're up there.
I can't hear you. Hello?
Annie. Annie, listen to me.

Hello?

Max?
Why? What are you going to do about it?
come on.
Max!
God. Felix Reyes-Torrena?
Yeah. I met him.
what do you mean, you met him? How?
I don't know. Look, when I dropped you off, there was a fare.
he said his name is Vincent.
wait, wait, wait. - This is the street.
this way. Come on.
stay up. Stay up. Stay up.
what we going to do? - Wait, wait.
wait, wait. Wait.
stay down.
shit!
there's a station.
Max!
I do this for a living!
we're almost at the next stop.
Hey, Max...
a guy gets on the MTA here in L. A. and dies.
think anybody will notice?
Mr. Seifert! Talk to me! When did you swallow it?
Mr. Seifert! Won't you tell me?
open your eyes!
you have to cooperate. Can you hear me?
bend your head forward.
open your eyes now!
bend your head forward. Now open wide for me please.
you have to swallow this now.
swallow! Don't fight it. Swallow please. Come on.
open your mouth wider please.
swallow. That's good. Well done.
don't fight it. Swallow it.
don't fight it. Swallow.

that's okay. We can drain the rest.

what made you do that?
what made you do it?
won't you tell me?
lt's because...
what?
l'm queer.
a homosexual.
Mathias, don't cry. That's nothing to cry about.
my name is Philipp Klahrmann.
l'm your new homeroom teacher.
shit.
sorry.
we need some water.
l hope it's not broken.
can you wet this for me? -Sure.
that's too wet. -Sorry.
l'm so embarrassed.
l'll be okay.
okay. Let's get a drink now. -No.
lt's crazy. -What?
glad l bumped into you. l didn't mean it like that.
let's go. l look awful. -You look fine.
two " fool's proof " .
like it? -Great.
we'll take 2 more.
what's it called? - " Fool's proof " .
l never go out.
hang on.
of course he's from the opticians where we met for the first time.
you stepped on my contact lens.
l think that he has the appearance of an Asian trader somehow.
stick to mineral water my love if you can't take the hard stuff.
l think the glasses suit you better.
they make you so manly and imposing.
Really? -Yes.
now it's party time.
l got rid of it all.
thank God for that.
l'd better be going. -No, stay a while.
how about tea? -Fine.
take off your coat.
Thanks.
l was going to make tea. l enjoyed the evening.
sorry l got a bit... you know...
we never socialized. -That's not true.
when? -A college dance in 1982.
we even danced together.
what? -l was a year above you.
you danced with Britta all the time. -l don't remember that.
don't remember! We all knew that you both...
what? -You had a thing going.
l did not. l hardly knew her.
all of us liked you.
did you paint those?
they're real good. -Thanks.
you're really talented.
you could turn professional. l'm sure.
what about the tea? -l still like you a lot.
ln films they throw them away.
romy Schneider, for example. l think that's great.
you ruined me.
l don't know what you did to me.
why did you go out with me?
no-one asks me out.
would you want me?
l mean...
as your husband?
l won't be offended if...
but l thought...
my God!
my God.
essay subject.
what moves me when l read this poem?
what do l move after reading it?
which suggestions do l make?
I need no gravestone.
if you need one for me
I want the following inscription:
he made suggestions.
we accepted them.
we are all honored by that inscription.
fucking nigger!
stop it you bastards!
bastards. Leave him alone!
bastards! Get away from him!
l'm disappointed.
really disappointed.
you're usually a bright bunch.
all l get from you is this boring, tired, innocuous junk.
l was expecting a lot more.
l thought we could get to know a lot more about each other.
what you really think.
get to know your goals in life. Hear about your desires, joys, doubts.
and your fears.
l don't want the right answers.
what you think l want to hear.
because the teacher decides what's said or thought.
no anger in you?
no need to make an effort?
how are you going to improve things in the future?
fight stupidity if you don't see it?
want to visit my mom? -No, Redford's coming.
l'll go. Won't take long.
who's coming? -Redford.
to look you over.
see if l'm good enough?
he was my neighbor. A good looker.
so his name's Redford? -Right.
jealous? -You bet l am.
l'll hurry. Behave yourself.
you wanted to see your mom.
about time you came.
l brought flowers.
no chrysanthemums, l hope. -No, l brought you gerberas.
you brought mums before. You know l'm allergic to them.
we have a hell of a lot of work.
you could help out a bit.
by washing clothes... shopping...
your sister must study.
she can't help out. Your father's away lecturing. And me?
l'm busy also. l have to work.
l don't know what to think.
you used to be different.
l was a kid. l lived here then.
just a bunch of excuses.
my life would have been different without you kids around.
so what?
who's that?
that's her. -Who?
my girlfriend. -You have a girlfriend?
since when?
a few weeks.
well, then...
bring her over.
l'm speechless.
going to marry her?
we must talk about it sometime then.
can you wash the dishes?
do the laundry...
well l never.
Yes, Mom.
you know each other?
yes... we once...
as class mates.
great to see you. We must meet more often.
visit me. Tanja knows my address.
maybe.
l guess you didn't get my letters? lt must be 2 or 3 years now.
never mind. So long.
what's wrong?
you were so rude.
almost winter again.
sometimes it helps to look at the sky.
the job's not easy.
not for anyone.
not only the kids make life hard.
lt's the gossipy colleagues too.
get too chummy.
you need more backbone.
lt's important.
you'll make out. l'm sure of that.
l'm there if you need me. -Thank you.
let us greet a new guest.
two minutes past midnight.
don't be shy.
come closer, young man. l don't bite. Larry dear...
find our new guest a seat, will you.
wait.
there's a seat at the bar honey.
l just came in for cigarettes.
don't be scared.
everyone is at first.
be brave.
would you like a drink?
you're too late. Larry's treating him.
don't be shy. Larry's okay.
my teeth are killing me.
l work all day on the new house.
hartmut doesn't help, the lazy cow. And the concrete. lt ruins my hands.
l wore my first evening gown when l was 15 years old.
l found it in a trunk in my great aunt's attic.
l put it on and went into the parlor. l admired myself in the mirror.
my aunt came in. She was a farmer.
she wore men's clothes. l didn't know she was a lesbian.
she entered and asked what l was wearing.
l replied: An evening gown.
she came to me and said: Nature's been fooling around with us.
you should be a girl. l should be a man.
there are no women any more.
the women say there are no men any more.
but l tell you one thing for sure. There are no women any more.
those 2 guys over there are teachers.
gorgeous boys.
a child psychologist and a crane operator.
don't drink so much, honey.
what do you all want from me? l have nothing to do with...
he meant l have nothing to do with you!
the heck there aren't any women. There aren't any women any more.
there you are!
you know...
l was so worried.
l was going crazy.
where were you?
see you later.
good evening. ls Mr. Schrader in?
Jakob, a visitor.
well! What a surprise!
Hi! -Come on in.
we just made some grog. Have a glass with us.
l just wanted... -Give me your coat.
have a seat. -Thanks.
ls Tanja okay? -Yeah, she's fine.
she doesn't know l'm here. l looked for you in the phone book.
we went to school together.
he lives with Tanja.
did you tell Tanja anything? -About what?
about the past.
did you tell her about us?
you know what l mean. -So that's why you came.
you haven't changed at all. A pity.
you're still as ashamed.
no, Jakob. l just...
that's just it. Since l saw you again...
everything's different.
lt's not real. -Not real? Not real?
stay here. We have no secrets. We live together.
we're proud of it. Understand?
please... -You don't mean it?
you never meant it, right? You didn't abandon me?
you didn't change schools because you hated the sight of me?
you didn't send your parents and accuse me of seducing you?
now you're telling me you didn't know?
your parents bought me a bicycle and gave me a compass.
to make up for having to do without you.
we were a large family.
and had little money.
Hey, fag!
look at him! Hi, sweetie!
let's get out of here.
a song from the ghetto.
my mother does not caII me by my name.
my mother is dead.
my father does not caII me by my name.
my father is far away.
God does not call me by my name.
l had a totally wrong impression of Lutz.
shyer and less mature.
he's great.
this is my stop. -You're braving awful weather.
just for me. -No, for us.
lt was your only birthday wish.
l have another wish. -What?
that you tell me when something's bothering you.
l mean if you have problems because of me.
l was so afraid.
l flipped my lid. l went completely nuts.
Why?
l don't know either.
excuse me?
when did the line start? -Yesterday morning.
l got here late too.
fancy meeting you here. Funny.
are you sure you know me? Aren't you mistaken?
you're Philipp.
Oh... Now l remember.
my God!
l came to around noon. l don't remember much.
this is the concert service.
pIease get in line.
the numbers wiII now be distributed.
they can be exchanged for tickets starting at 9 o'clock.
barenboim and Celibidache impressed me.
abbado was also quite good.
l couldn't get tickets for Bernstein.
back in 1984 l saw him at the gala premiere.
lt was simply out of this world.
let's go.
what a goddamn mess. Everything's dirty.
these sluts! lt's the same pigpen every morning.
really! lt's enough to drive you crazy.
just look at the state it's in. lt's absolutely filthy.
l'll kill those bitches. What a dump.
we're glad the dump is open. -Sit at the counter.
l can't be running a marathon on Saturday before breakfast.
he's a good looker, isn't he?
he loved going to rock concerts.
l don't understand you kids liking religious stuff.
lt's been 12, no 13 years now since he crashed his bike into a truck.
he was my only son.
that's life.
he was only 19. How old are you? -l'm 20. Almost.
so?
what now?
l have to go.
lt's a pity.
Thanks. For everything.
tough luck.
what did you think of me? -Why?
l was so drunk.
l was thinking of myself.
lt's like that when you find out what you are.
you hang out in bars and drink just to drown all your problems.
l'm giving a birthday party tonight in that bar.
try to come. -That's why we drank champagne.
l can't come.
lt's impossible. Sorry.
come later if you like.
no... l can't possibly come.
you'll come. l know you will.
shall we take in a late movie?
not tonight.
l have a hard day ahead of me. Are you disappointed?
no.
you're so jumpy.
l just felt like it somehow.
let's drink some grog and go to bed.
you can read to me. How about it?
okay. Let's do that.
I cIicked my heeIs together sharply. It brought the tears to my eyes.
pIease don't be sad. I need to be alone for a whiIe.
don't worry about me or try to contact me. Philipp.
that's him! Philipp!
this is my mom and dad.
my sister Sonja. Her friend Carsten.
my cousin Ulrike. Holger, Sebastian, Alex and Erika.
you met Walter already.
you all waited for me?
lncredible.
l always wanted to live so high up.
don't your folks mind the fact that you came back to my place?
why should they? lt's perfectly okay.
look, a train.
like a toy.
what's with you?
you're so quiet all of a sudden.
you are Mathias.
l believe l've waited for you.
at least for the past 2 years.
how do you know?
do you have a lover? -No.
honest? -Sure.
maybe you do now.
me.
maybe it isn't such a good idea. -You have a lover after all?
rubbish.
don't you want a family? To have kids some day?
no. l don't want any of that.
l know l can't have it anyway.
did you know my grandma wrote poems?
they were very erotic poems.
swallows fIew around the loving couple.
she sighed: Come to me, BeIoved.
TousIe my hair.
rip off my panties and be my ruination.
do you know the feeling when you're going to bed?
the feeling that maybe someone might ring your bell.
but nobody comes?
l'm talking nonsense.
but yesterday.
out in the cold. For the first time in my life.
l noticed l'd found someone.
someone's hand to hold and make me warm inside.
then you're not alone.
maybe.
maybe it's possible.
l think you're incredible.
l never slept with another man before.
can l come again?
you look awful.
go see a doctor. -There are enough people off sick.
problems? -Nope.
Tanja shows it more.
you might think she's pregnant.
what?
one might think so. That's all.
you wouldn't be overjoyed, l guess.
has Tanja said anything to you? -Not exactly, but...
when a woman gets dizzy spells.
and gets morning sickness.
you say it's all okay.
l hope it's true.
l have no choice. You can leave.
l won't leave you. Never.
maybe it's my fault you wanted a new girlfriend.
l want you. lt won't happen again...
man. l love you.
hell and Damnation. l'm just being a stupid cow. Shit.
so sorry.
at long last.
why are you never home?
l thought something happened.
how are you doing?
your drink.
this was my last hope.
l looked all over for you.
l knew you'd be here tonight.
l have so much to tell you.
the champagne.
Yes, l... -What?
this is Mathias.
this is my wife, Tanja.
Yes, this is Tanja. My wife.
Oh, l see.
l see.
l wasn't hiding it from you.
not on purpose.
so that's what's up.
l didn't even notice.
let me explain.
lt's idiotic.
l know you...
go on!
know my next birthday wish?
for you to get out of here. Don't touch me!
do you know the time? lt is 9. 40 now.
your class started at 7. 50. Come and see me after school.
mignon.
stop talking at once!
lt's unfair to him.
time to go home, darlings.
time is up. The hardship cases must go too.
l'll go now. -Finish your beer first.
l'm not a civil servant.
have you seen Mathias around? The guy l was in here with...
do you know his address? -Know how many Mathias come here?
ask me another one.
sorry. -Mathias?
Mathias? The charming dentist? He's very generous.
l think he lives in Grunau. -No, he moved last August.
l didn't mean him.
you mean the young guy who celebrated his birthday.
he's never been back.
someone must know his name and where he lives.
nobody knows anybody's name or his address here.
everyone is alone here.
everyone is afraid.
Hi, Philipp. -Mom?
lf you won't come，l can't sleep at night.
don't look at me like that.
Why?
why must it be? -What?
l mean...
the way you are. -There's no other way.
why do l have to justify myself?
Why?
ls it better to pretend?
lie to oneself? Aim for a goal one can never reach?
make others unhappy for lack of an alternative?
because nature made me this way?
who am l harming?
my so-called reputation?
don't we all have a right to live as nature intended?
no, please. -Tell me how can l help you?
by not crying.
as a child l often cried for you.
when you and dad fought.
that did no good at all.
l just wanted you to be happy.
unhappy?
l'm unhappy because of you.
that's the only reason.
feel like it?
here? Or your place? -Not here.
that was fun.
see you.
ls everything okay?
okay?
ls your wife out of town? Taking a night off?
come on, Lutz.
Philipp, meet Lutz.
come on in. Welcome!
join the fun! The more the merrier!
it's your birthday today.
so I toId myself
I'd dedicate this song to you...
get your hands off me dirty old man!
that's not the way we behave around here.
lt was a misunderstanding.
didn't you hear me? A misunderstanding.
sit down over here.
l don't allow aggression in here. -l know.
bring us a drink. Two brandies.
l'm not serving him. Just one.
bring two. l'll drink both.
right. Two large brandies coming up.
you think we always make a pass at every man we approach?
just because we're gay?
can't we just be trying to help?
and be kind like other people?
two large brandies for you. -The same again.
l'm not saying anything.
better bring a whole tray.
stop crying.
leave me alone. Just leave me alone, will you?
l'm afraid.
l'm terrified.
l'm a high school teacher.
know what that means? A queer high school teacher.
lt could be worse.
l'm not saying another word.
we can turn people away who get drunk.
lt could happen to you. So be careful.
l don't mind you insulting me.
but l can't take brutality.
l've taken too much.
l already paid my price to be able to sit here and wait.
wait like everyone else here.
for a man to smile.
honest, tender and loving.
lt is so easy nowadays in this society.
once...
once l met the love of my life.
fifty years back.
his name was Karl.
l was twenty. He was twenty-eight.
we had worked out a good way to conceal it.
one night...
l don't know who reported us.
we were dragged out of our tent, disciplined and taken away.
they took us to Gestapo HQ in Berlin.
we were imprisoned.
Karl and l.
ln isolation cells. Solitary confinement.
they sent me to a concentration camp.
Sachsenhausen.
l wore a pink triangle. l was dirt to them.
then l became a member of the Communist Party.
the comrades saved me.
l was an activist from the first hour after the war.
we worked like crazy.
now it does not matter if the person you work with is a Jew or whatever.
except gays.
they were forgotten somehow.
l am so sorry, Mr. Klahrman.
certain events which we must discuss later on force us to carry out an inspection of your work.
we shall begin now.
go ahead.
please sit elsewhere.
Yes.
Mr. Seifert! Talk to me! When did you swallow it?
Mr. Seifert! Won't you tell me?
open your eyes!
you have to cooperate. Can you hear me?
bend your head forward.
open your eyes now!
bend your head forward. Now open wide for me please.
you have to swallow this now.
swallow! Don't fight it. Swallow please. Come on.
open your mouth wider please.
swallow. That's good. Well done.
don't fight it. Swallow it.
don't fight it. Swallow.
don't forget to breathe.
now it will be a little unpleasant.
your head to one side.
don't forget to breathe. That's right.
breathe in. You're doing fine. Don't spit it out.
swallow it.
turn your head to one side.
that's okay. We can drain the rest.
don't fall asleep.
lt'll soon be over.
almost finished.
this will be unpleasant.
keep calm.
what made you do that?
what made you do it?
won't you tell me?
lt's because...
what?
l'm queer.
a homosexual.
Mathias, don't cry. That's nothing to cry about.
my name is Philipp Klahrmann.
l'm your new homeroom teacher.
shit.

we need some water.
l hope it's not broken.

you didn't change schools because you hated the sight of me?
you didn't send your parents and accuse me of seducing you?
now you're telling me you didn't know?
your parents bought me a bicycle and gave me a compass.
to make up for having to do without you.
we were a large family.
and had little money.
Hey, fag!
look at him! Hi, sweetie!
let's get out of here.
a song from the ghetto.
my mother does not caII me by my name.
my mother is dead.
my father does not caII me by my name.
my father is far away.
God does not call me by my name.
l had a totally wrong impression of Lutz.
shyer and less mature.
he's great.
this is my stop. -You're braving awful weather.
just for me. -No, for us.
lt was your only birthday wish.
l have another wish. -What?
that you tell me when something's bothering you.
l mean if you have problems because of me.
l was so afraid.
l flipped my lid. l went completely nuts.
Why?
l don't know either.
excuse me?
when did the line start? -Yesterday morning.
l got here late too.
fancy meeting you here. Funny.
are you sure you know me? Aren't you mistaken?
you're Philipp.
Oh... Now l remember.
my God!
l came to around noon. l don't remember much.
this is the concert service.
pIease get in line.
the numbers wiII now be distributed.
they can be exchanged for tickets starting at 9 o'clock.
barenboim and Celibidache impressed me.
abbado was also quite good.
l couldn't get tickets for Bernstein.
back in 1984 l saw him at the gala premiere.
lt was simply out of this world.
let's go.
what a goddamn mess. Everything's dirty.
these sluts! lt's the same pigpen every morning.
really! lt's enough to drive you crazy.
just look at the state it's in. lt's absolutely filthy.
l'll kill those bitches. What a dump.
we're glad the dump is open. -Sit at the counter.
l can't be running a marathon on Saturday before breakfast.
he's a good looker, isn't he?
he loved going to rock concerts.
l don't understand you kids liking religious stuff.
lt's been 12, no 13 years now since he crashed his bike into a truck.
he was my only son.
that's life.
he was only 19. How old are you? -l'm 20. Almost.
so?
what now?
l have to go.
lt's a pity.
Thanks. For everything.
tough luck.
what did you think of me? -Why?
l was so drunk.
l was thinking of myself.
lt's like that when you find out what you are.
you hang out in bars and drink just to drown all your problems.
l'm giving a birthday party tonight in that bar.
try to come. -That's why we drank champagne.
l can't come.
lt's impossible. Sorry.
come later if you like.
no... l can't possibly come.
you'll come. l know you will.
shall we take in a late movie?
not tonight.
l have a hard day ahead of me. Are you disappointed?
no.
you're so jumpy.
l just felt like it somehow.
let's drink some grog and go to bed.
you can read to me. How about it?
okay. Let's do that.
I cIicked my heeIs together sharply. It brought the tears to my eyes.
pIease don't be sad. I need to be alone for a whiIe.
don't worry about me or try to contact me. Philipp.
that's him! Philipp!
this is my mom and dad.
my sister Sonja. Her friend Carsten.
my cousin Ulrike. Holger, Sebastian, Alex and Erika.
you met Walter already.
you all waited for me?
lncredible.
l always wanted to live so high up.
don't your folks mind the fact that you came back to my place?
why should they? lt's perfectly okay.
look, a train.
like a toy.
what's with you?
you're so quiet all of a sudden.
you are Mathias.
l believe l've waited for you.
at least for the past 2 years.
how do you know?
do you have a lover? -No.
honest? -Sure.
maybe you do now.
me.
maybe it isn't such a good idea. -You have a lover after all?
rubbish.
don't you want a family? To have kids some day?
no. l don't want any of that.
l know l can't have it anyway.
did you know my grandma wrote poems?
they were very erotic poems.
swallows fIew around the loving couple.
she sighed: Come to me, BeIoved.
TousIe my hair.
rip off my panties and be my ruination.
do you know the feeling when you're going to bed?
the feeling that maybe someone might ring your bell.
but nobody comes?
l'm talking nonsense.
but yesterday.
out in the cold. For the first time in my life.
l noticed l'd found someone.
someone's hand to hold and make me warm inside.
then you're not alone.
maybe.
maybe it's possible.
l think you're incredible.
l never slept with another man before.
can l come again?
you look awful.
go see a doctor. -There are enough people off sick.
problems? -Nope.
Tanja shows it more.
you might think she's pregnant.
what?
one might think so. That's all.
you wouldn't be overjoyed, l guess.
has Tanja said anything to you? -Not exactly, but...
when a woman gets dizzy spells.
and gets morning sickness.
you say it's all okay.
l hope it's true.
l have no choice. You can leave.
l won't leave you. Never.
maybe it's my fault you wanted a new girlfriend.
l want you. lt won't happen again...
man. l love you.
hell and Damnation. l'm just being a stupid cow. Shit.
so sorry.
at long last.
why are you never home?
l thought something happened.
how are you doing?
your drink.
this was my last hope.
l looked all over for you.
l knew you'd be here tonight.
l have so much to tell you.
the champagne.
Yes, l... -What?
this is Mathias.
this is my wife, Tanja.
Yes, this is Tanja. My wife.
Oh, l see.
l see.
l wasn't hiding it from you.
not on purpose.
so that's what's up.
l didn't even notice.
let me explain.
lt's idiotic.
l know you...
go on!
know my next birthday wish?
for you to get out of here. Don't touch me!
do you know the time? lt is 9. 40 now.
your class started at 7. 50. Come and see me after school.
mignon.
stop talking at once!
lt's unfair to him.
time to go home, darlings.
time is up. The hardship cases must go too.
l'll go now. -Finish your beer first.
l'm not a civil servant.
have you seen Mathias around? The guy l was in here with...
do you know his address? -Know how many Mathias come here?
ask me another one.
sorry. -Mathias?
Mathias? The charming dentist? He's very generous.
l think he lives in Grunau. -No, he moved last August.
l didn't mean him.
you mean the young guy who celebrated his birthday.
he's never been back.
someone must know his name and where he lives.
nobody knows anybody's name or his address here.
everyone is alone here.
everyone is afraid.
Hi, Philipp. -Mom?
lf you won't come，l can't sleep at night.
don't look at me like that.
Why?
why must it be? -What?
l mean...
the way you are. -There's no other way.
why do l have to justify myself?
Why?
ls it better to pretend?
lie to oneself? Aim for a goal one can never reach?
make others unhappy for lack of an alternative?
because nature made me this way?
who am l harming?
my so-called reputation?
don't we all have a right to live as nature intended?
no, please. -Tell me how can l help you?
by not crying.
as a child l often cried for you.
when you and Dad fought.
that did no good at all.
l just wanted you to be happy.
unhappy?
l'm unhappy because of you.
that's the only reason.
feel like it?
here? Or your place? -Not here.
that was fun.
see you.
ls everything okay?
okay?
ls your wife out of town? Taking a night off?
come on, Lutz.
Philipp, meet Lutz.
come on in. Welcome!
join the fun! The more the merrier!
it's your birthday today.
so I toId myself
I'd dedicate this song to you...
get your hands off me dirty old man!
that's not the way we behave around here.
lt was a misunderstanding.
didn't you hear me? A misunderstanding.
sit down over here.
l don't allow aggression in here. -l know.
bring us a drink. Two brandies.
l'm not serving him. Just one.
bring two. l'll drink both.
right. Two large brandies coming up.
you think we always make a pass at every man we approach?
just because we're gay?
can't we just be trying to help?
and be kind like other people?
two large brandies for you. -The same again.
l'm not saying anything.
better bring a whole tray.
stop crying.
leave me alone. Just leave me alone, will you?
l'm afraid.
l'm terrified.
l'm a high school teacher.
know what that means? A queer high school teacher.
lt could be worse.
l'm not saying another word.
we can turn people away who get drunk.
lt could happen to you. So be careful.
l don't mind you insulting me.
but l can't take brutality.
l've taken too much.
l already paid my price to be able to sit here and wait.
wait like everyone else here.
for a man to smile.
honest, tender and loving.
lt is so easy nowadays in this society.
once...
once l met the love of my life.
fifty years back.
his name was Karl.
l was twenty. He was twenty-eight.
we had worked out a good way to conceal it.
one night...
l don't know who reported us.
we were dragged out of our tent, disciplined and taken away.
they took us to Gestapo HQ in Berlin.
we were imprisoned.
Karl and l.
ln isolation cells. Solitary confinement.
they sent me to a concentration camp.
Sachsenhausen.
l wore a pink triangle. l was dirt to them.
then l became a member of the Communist Party.
the comrades saved me.
l was an activist from the first hour after the war.
we worked like crazy.
now it does not matter if the person you work with is a Jew or whatever.
except gays.
they were forgotten somehow.
l am so sorry, Mr. Klahrmann.
certain events which we must discuss later on force us to carry out an inspection of your work.
we shall begin now.
go ahead.
please sit elsewhere.
Yes.
the president has had a stroke.
what happens now? Do I take the oath?
madam vice President, we need you to resign.
if you can't deliver then maybe you should step aside.
this is what we do. We do the right thing.
do you want to be president because you want the power?
that's not me.
well, that's the problem.
I'm going to go out there and I'm going to take the oath of office.
the president, of the united states
I want you to be my chief of staff.
they don't see me as a spouse. They see me as an adviser.
do yourself a favor, Rod Stay in your lane.
templeton is not choosing my vice president.
Mackenzie Allen needs to show a little respect.
she's picked somebody already.
warren Keaton, he won't be confirmed.
sync: YTET - cheshirecat - ==www. ydy. com/bbs ==
good morning, Ma'am.
good workout?
the best.
you have a meeting with the chair of AIPAC in 45 mins.
what should I know?
he's a hugger.
anything in the N.S.C. Brief about San Pasquale?
it's been a couple of days now.
well, that's above my security clearance, Ma'am -Morning, Madam President -Joan, tell me everything.
command post in place, surveillance installed prelim background checks, on all the faculty and student body completed.
big change from the last couple of years.
maybe I should take them myself - meet with the principal... all due respect, ma'am, there's no time on the schedule it's really not necessary, and frankly, it's not as simple as you just wanting to take them.
I'm trusting you with my kids here
we know -Hey, boss -Hey.
Hey, Willy.
now that is a magnificent beast.
the congressman flew in from Missouri to meet.
I thought a face-to-face.
it's about Warren Keaton.
I hope you're with me on this, Nate.
I think Keaton's dangerous that seeing the horror of the battlefield actually softened him.
it makes him weak on security. He shouldn't be vice president.
if you're trying to get on the confirmation committee, that's a matter of seniority.
I can't help you there.
that -- that's not why I'm here, Nate
the congressman served with General Keaton in the gulf.
he was in a unique position to hear things.
well, more than hear.
we became friends.
he confided in me.
so you want to be a patriot make sure the committee is fully informed on who Keaton really is.
stevenson's not running for reelection.
you want in on appropriations?
well, patriots should be rewarded.
congressman, it's not that simple.
there have been deals in place for a while.
he was your friend.
he stumped for you.
he promised me he'd enter politics as a republican.
I vouched for him.
I promised the party, and he turncoated.
he made an ass out of me.
he won't be confirmed, not with what I know.
revenge, Jayne.
it's the only motivator I have any real faith in.
I can't talk deals with you, Willy.
not personally.
thank you for coming by, oh, really?
Oh, I missed that part.
Yeah, I fell asleep.
I know.
Oh, yeah. Okay.
let me ask my mom.
all right, great - Stacy - um...
can I call you back?
Bye, Stacy.
are you hungry?
um... mom, could I, uh.
spend the night at Stacy's tonight?
Oh, I thought it was a school night.
I--well, yeah, it's just I haven't seen her since we moved here.
and we're in different schools, mom - Maybe on the weekend - Mom...
okay, I found her - hey - hey, dad.
morning, sunshine - Ready for your first day back at school? - Mnh-mnh.
dibs on driving.
not gonna happen.
from now on the secret service takes you wherever you need to go.
wait, so.
we're never gonna be able to drive again?
maybe at camp, David.
Amy, what are you eating?
chocolate chip pancakes.
uh - huh.
there you go.
listen, guys.
I just want you all to be prepared for today.
there's gonna be a larger secret service detail covering you.
you'll probably be paid more attention by onlookers, the other kids.
mom, we've been going to the same stupid school for two years now.
Yeah, no one's gonna care that was before your mom became president.
there's a difference.
the country has a fascination with the presidency.
you guys are gonna have to understand...
madam President - Jim.
sorry to interrupt.
morning, Jim.
Hi, Mr. Gardner.
good morning, sweetie -We're needed in the situation room - Mm-hmm.
because of that, we're going to have to push our prep sessions for General Keaton's confirmation hearings.
right. Sure.
I can start those up for you.
I've vetted a fair number of candidates in my time.
would that be helpful, Jim?
sure.
come on, we're in the same class...
okay, guys, I'll see you later - Later, mom - See you, mom.
this about the agents in San Pasquale?
Yes, Ma'am.
okay.
room, attention.
madam president.
what do you have for me?
I'm afraid, ma'am we've had some bad news.
our nine agents were found along the San Pasquale border, dead.
shot in the back of the head, execution style.
we have several covert agents on the ground with eavesdrop capabilities.
they're working the case.
I'm sorry, everyone. Please sit down -Are these the agents? -Yes, Ma'am.
does anyone know their names?
Ma'am...that's Raymond Carvelli.
that's Raymond Carvelli.
and where is he from?
Carvelli's from Omaha.
Jeff Reich from Austin.
martin Hemstead from Naples, Florida.
samuel Mitroka from Pridgeport, Connecticut...
these guys, the agents they managed to shut down the Martinez Cartel and they were just beginning to make headway into the bevaro organization - How much are we talking? - $2 billion a year easily but the big drug money's elsewhere.
the government of San Pasquale
drug trade doesn't flourish like this in a vacuum.
but we have no proof and no diplomatic relations.
not since General Sanchez initiated a coup a year ago, there's been almost 200 juntas since San Pasquale was founded.
it borders on a national pastime.
Sanchez toppled Juan Duran the first democratically elected president in years.
I want to talk to General Sanchez.
call him directly?
ma'am, the leader of the free world does not give audience to the unelected head of a thugocracy.
he needs to hear this from me directly.
I want him to turn over the person or people who killed our men to us.
he needs to hear that from the president of the United States.
his ego's not gonna let him do it otherwise.
make the call happen.
Yes, Ma'am.
so basically, you're taking over the faculty parking lot?
Yeah, a portion of it, its proximity to our campus command post.
look, I know you guys have a job to do - but so do we -Sir, our responsibility here is to protect the first family of the United States.
I understand that, but it's hard enough for my teachers.
some of whom were found to have police records.
in any event, we've slated those faculty members for a more exhaustive background check. Thanks.
is that -- is that always gonna be here?
we anticipate some level of media exposure today.
ma'am, I must repeat my concerns about this call.
you have. Thank you.
general Sanchez, this is the president of the United States.
my English is quite good, thank you.
general, I'm sure you're aware that nine American citizens were found assassinated on your country's border.
Yes, a tragedy.
and although we cannot confirm the murders took place in San Pasquale
I assure you, we will investigate this crime.
tell me, madam. these Americans, they were tourists?
general Sanchez, this is Jim Gardner chief of staff.
they were...
independent contractors working on the pipeline efforts there.
I'm relieved. For if these men were spies well, that would complicate matters.
but if the president of the United States assures me otherwise.
general Sanchez we are very grateful for your willingness to investigate this matter.
we would like to send a team there to assist you.
I am confident in my own men.
thank you. Thank you, General.
and you, Madam President.
I need two boxes from storage both labeled "vetting books."
I'll send Louis.
and we start the prep at 1: 30.
Oh, I also need the video of the vice-presidential debate.
but the F.A.P.E. Event is at 2.
friends of Art and Preservation.
Oh, the embassies, right okay, well we need to reschedule that.
that's been on the boo for months. Well.
the Keaton hearing that's gonna start as soon as two weeks.
that's our priority.
sir, I just don't think that falls within the purview of what we do.
it does now.
you said it yourself.
I am the first gentlemen, so it's a whole new ballgame.
we get to make up the rules - Yes, Sir - hey, guys -Oh, Mrs. Bridges - Hi, Nora. Rod - Hi, Grace - How are things going?
well, I'm being run around by Nora, here.
well, we accomplished a lot together, didn't we, Nora?
that we did, Ma'am.
hmm. I'm just going to go grab a little breakfast. - Okay. - Okay.
let me know if you need anything.
okay. Thanks, Grace.
I feel so sorry for her.
she was so happy being the First Lady.
uh, Grace.
I could use your help on something, actually.
what can I do for you?
what are you thinking?
Sanchez did it.
I feel it in my gut he had our guys killed.
where is president Duran living now?
in the states, right?
he fled to D.C. Uh, to Georgetown in fact, right after the coup.
good.
Jim, I want to meet with Duran, face-to-face.
what would the agenda be?
I need his advice.
the people elected him He knows the people.
and he knows Sanchez.
done special agent Dulcer.
Yes, Ma'am.
it's the president.
Hi, mom.
Oh, hey. How's it going?
good. We're almost there.
how's your sister?
stuck up
same as always.
be nice. Pass me over, will you?
she wants to talk to you.
Hi!
Hi!
I just wanted to tell you to have a really great day.
Thanks. You too.
listen, uh.
you know, I was thinking that maybe later we...
we've got intercepts from San Pasquale.
um, hey, mom, we gotta go.
okay, bye.bye, honey.
I'm so not doing this.
it'll be fine.
okay, we have a landing.
Rebecca, let's go.
come on. Come on. How does it feel, going to public school?
Horace, what's it like in the white house?
come on, Becca.
I don't wanna go.
it's all right. I'm right here.
I got you.
Rebecca, over here!
Sanchez implicates himself all over these transcripts "They keep sending them, they'll keep dying.
quote, unquote.
this is too easy. He knows we're listening.
he's taunting us.
he's sending a message. He's saying, "you work your end of the street and I'll work mine"; " Get your agents out of my country."
all right, so if we know he's responsible for the murders what are my options? Sanctions, embargoes.
no, that takes too long I don't want to hear about sanctions.
those are public options. Nonpublic, that's different
we've used private contractors before.
mercenaries.
won't work.
one thing Sanchez knows how to do is protect himself.
so... citizens of our country were brutally murdered and you're telling me there's nothing I can do about it.
right?
I want a plan to arrest Sanchez to get him into an American court and I want it within the hour.
Yes, Ma'am.
good morning!
good morning!
morning, General!
morning!
you moving in?
just set it right there, thanks.
our research on you from the campaign
you can only imagine what templeton and his committee will have given that they've got 300 F.B.I. Agents out there researching you,too
doesn't bother me.
I've taken a lot of hills on the battlefield.
well, these hearings may last maybe four days, and for that we're going to need four weeks to prepare you.
forget it.
I'm not sitting on my ass for a month practicing what I already know I'm going to say.
and what's that?
the truth, just like in the campaign.
which you lost and speaking of the truth, we'll need to discuss exactly how to deal with the specific verbal assaults that you made on the president during the campaign.
is that what this going to be about getting even with me over what I said about your wife?
thank you, guys.
you can close the door.
general Keaton, you wouldn't have been my choice for vice-president but the president selected you and I have been tasked with getting you confirmed and I swear to you, that is what I am going to do whether you like it or not.
you may know how to take a hill but you don't know how to take capitol hill.
you have to understand, Madam President.
washington is a sensitive place populated by sensitive people vain people.
people who are easily insulted.
you're saying I should have been more inclusive in my vice-presidential search.
some feathers have been ruffled.
yours?
me? No.
not me, no.
I gave Jim five names and I'm sure you gave them a thorough going-over, but some of my colleagues several of them, in fact they... they may want to make a show of things.
Ah.
a little bit of "next time, she'll remember which side her bread is buttered on that sort of thing," you know what I mean.
not really.
you don't even look tired.
that's great.
you look great.
Keaton has problems.
more personal than political, but ...problems, nonetheless.
like what?
no. No, I can't. I mean that would mean breaking a confidence, but...
I just wanted to advise you.
then I am so advised.
good. - Thank you. - Thank you.
Oh, I am correct, Madam President. Am I not in presuming that you will meet with the gang of eight over San Pasquale?
Mr. Speaker, what are you talking about?
Oh, bloody hell, Jim.
Mr. I-can-neither-confirm nor-deny.
I'm aware of my obligations.
good, because everybody's still a little edgy after the Nigerian action.
see you all. Thank you, air force one.
Yes, president?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Nate, come on in, thank you.
Oh, boy, oh, boy, was that something I'm telling you.
I swear, we're going to pick up three additional seats in Southern California.
Uh-huh. It's a hell of a lot more fun campaigning when you're not doing it for yourself.
you were great out there, Mr. President, brilliant.
you wanted to see me, sir?
ahh, Nate...
I got to get rid of her.
she's taking meetings on capitol hill, she's taking meetings with congressmen and cabinet members and governors.
she's spouting her own agenda.
well, that was inevitable.
Stevie wonder could see that coming.
she's not a lap dog.
she's a Doberman pinscher and she doesn't like the leash you got on her.
the stuff you've given her to do would make Walter Mondale's vice presidency look activist.
you need to give her something that she can get her teeth into without making you bleed.
you've got to recognize something useful in her.
she's a woman.
it's so easy to deal with women if you just remember they're not men.
well, I've already made up my mind.
I want her out and I want you in.
she got you elected.
I mean, she's bizarrely popular.
you can't fire her.
it'd be a shock to the system.
I'm not going to be the fall guy on that.
it's not going to happen, not with my plan.
Oh, you son of A...
you want her to fill the Talmadge's vacancy.
it's what she wanted in the first place, anyway.
are you sleeping with her?
because that's what it's going to look like.
I mean, why else would you put her in the supreme court?
it's 4 to 4, she'd be the swing vote.
you can't do that.
she's a loose cannon.
it's the only way to replace her.
I can't be a part of that plan.
no, I'm sorry.
come on, Nate.
it's the vice presidency.
it's a demotion.
not with you in it.
just... just tell me you'll think about it.
sure, I'll think about it. You're my friend, you're my president.
Mr. Speaker, may I help you in some way?
no, I'm fine, thank you.
excuse me.
so what, are we supposed to ask for your autograph now?
no, but feel free to buy me lunch - Yeah, right. You're the one with all the cash - Not.
so what's it like?
what?
living there, being you.
not that different, really.
Oh, bull...
I mean, you know, other than the help like, how many butlers and stuff do you have?
six, plus maids, cooks.
what about a masseuse?
you got some kind of presidential masseuse?
it's not Vegas. Relax.
so when do we get to come over?
uh, I got to go, guys.
Hey, Bec want some company?
not really they can't do this.
ma'am, do you want me to see if I could maybe...
well, who's on the desk?
let me talk to him.
jeez, I've got to go.
Hey, heads up boys and girls.
gather around, folks.
madam president.
we're O.T.R. Okay?
ma'am, if I may, we're hearing some reports about some drug enforcement agents who may be missing in San Pasquale.
okay, guys, this is not a press conference.
look, I get the appeal of covering the children of the president.
it's fun, it's endearing, it's marketable.
the one thing it's not news.
ma'am, don't you think the press should determine what is and isn't news?
Yes, I do.
still, some of you are parents and I assume you have the same rule number one that I do and... By the way, this is not Mac the president talking.
this is Mac the mother.
don't mess with my kids okay, ma'am? We should...
thank you, everyone.
thank you, ma'am.
look, I can't be in the press room and suddenly be hit with kidnapped drug enforcement agents, for god's sake and I have to stand up there and have no idea what's going on and these people think I'm hopelessly out of the loop.
San Pasquale, it's classified.
it's obviously not that classified.
I'm sorry. I should have known there would be a leak.
I have to be able to do my job and part of that is knowing when to keep her away from the press ...the united states is represented most fully...
what's going on there?
I don't know.
she's definitely raised the bar on squatting - Look, I'll get into it with the president - Thank you.
Mr. Gardner...
what is Grace doing?
this is a friend of art and preservation in embassies event.
the first gentleman asked Mrs. Bridges to cover for him.
you have to help me. I don't know what to do with him - Hi, Tommy - Hi, Amy.
what's this room called?
the east room, they do all the fancy events here.
like what?
I don't know. Never got to go to any.
who's that?
that's my nanny. - Who's that? - My nanny.
my mom's kind of busy today, want to see something cool?
sure.
this's wrong, see? It says "united sates" not "united states."
my mom will fix that.
she's the president now.
you know, you're never gonna see her again.
huh?
you just won't...
but this is the only time Grace has done anything.
and the task may well have been given to her out of kindness but we can't un-ring a bell, and I'm afraid with her showing no signs of leaving...
I'll talk to her. - She's not the one that needs to be talked to. - I'll take care of it. - Thank you.
okay. - President Duran is here. - Good.
where is he? Thanks - He's in the residence. - Okay
ma'am. Mr. Gardner, N.S.C. and A.G. are in the oval -Thanks, Vince - My pleasure, sir - Let's see what staff has to say then we'll deal with Duran. - Okay.
we can find no remedy to justify the seizure and forced extradition of president Sanchez.
we have Sanchez bragging about the murders. What else do you need?
an indictment, which takes time that you don't have.
it took two years after the grand jury in Miami for us to be able to pick up Noriega.
and frankly, there is very little legal precedent for us to go after Sanchez or any other head of state for that matter.
qaddafi bombed pan am and we didn't try to arrest him.
and that makes you proud, Melanie?
I'm the Attorney General Jim, I'm being asked for my legal opinion.
we cannot go down there and arrest him.
end of story.
can we block his assets?
well, you certainly have the authority under I.E.E.P.A. to do that.
Sanchez has no assets to block.
under U.S. Jurisdiction, everything he has is in offshore trust funds and various front companies that only treasury can go after - Let's do that, then -well, that takes time, too and eventually, the O.F.A.C. is going to go to C.I.A.
and require open records on intelligence sources and methods including illegal wire taps and that is something we cannot and will not do
ma'am, we're going to end up dropping this case.
are you telling me, are you seriously telling me that all my options are exhausted?
there are more options.
give us a few hours.
I'd always hoped that my first visit with the American president would take place in the oval office.
we felt it best to meet privately.
we have reason to believe General Sanchez murdered American drug enforcement agents.
my sources tell me this as well.
my team is preparing options for me as to how to arrest him.
Mr. President, when this happens are you prepared to reassume the office to which you were democratically chosen?
madam president, are you planning on invading my country?
that is not my desire at all but somehow, Sanchez will be brought to justice, so again, do your countrymen have a leader?
that depends on your conditions.
Jim, would you give us a minute alone?
I'd like to speak to Mr. Duran privately, president to president.
I'm available if you need me.
there are no conditions, Mr. President.
this is your country, whose citizens were deprived of the leadership they chose.
I only ask that you turn over to the united states these killers.
they are enemies of San Pasquale as well.
this all may happen rather quickly. - I would stay in D. C. If I were you. - I understand war isn't pretty, and sometimes innocent civilians get caught in the middle.
and that's the sound bite that will lead the evening news.
you never served, did you, Calloway?
see, now that's perfect.
that's a great way to endear yourself to the committee. call them a bunch of cowards and desk jockeys.
okay, you told "The New York Times" that then candidate Mackenzie Allen "was dead wrong on her support of the wall on the west bank. That it was a form of repression.
are you about to explain how you're right and the president is wrong?
I'm about to show how I'm my own man.
and that's exactly what they want you to do.
show that you're not a part of the president's team.
finances.
since you've retired you have joined the board of two companies. - ...that do business with - that is it!
everything is an open game here but my integrity!
that is the limit!
well, the committee could care less about your limits and believe me, Nathan Templeton and his bulldogs are just salivating over the thought of you blowing your top on national TV which is why I'm going to let you take it all out on me right now so get it out of your system.
every penny I make from those boards goes directly to charity
I know.
but let's talk about your medals.
there are allegations that some of your citations may have been exaggerated.
Oh, come on.
sir, Mr. Calloway...
the president wants some interview time, sir
to be continued, I suppose.
let's push up the meetings with labor and transportation.
and the secretary General of N.A.T.O?
the only man I know who can beg in 19 languages.
do yourself a favor - cancel.
Laura, would you excuse us a minute?
of course. - Thank you, Laura.
much as I enjoy the sound of my own voice, ma'am.
I do appreciate the break.
Mmm. Confirmation prep ing that well?
your husband likes to kick anthills.
he's good. Been through it, myself.
so Templeton came to see me and he insists he has something on you when your confirmation comes up.
did he say what?
that would spoil the drama of it.
there's nothing in my background that would embarrass you, Ma'am.
good.
I'd like to kick his ass.
tell me, do you still have top secret code word clearance?
as a matter of fact, I do.
good, then I would like your help with something yeah!
Stacy, it wasn't fun.
it just really freaked me out.
Really? She transferred to Sidwell?
Oh. Okay.
all right, yeah, um, I got to go, too, actually.
I'll talk to you later, Stace. Bye. - Hey. - Hey. - So you ever play? - What? sports?
I was on the swim team in Richmond.
that was a few years ago.
you don't like it here, do you?
most of my friends go to private school.
it'd probably be a lot easier on you.
it's hard for us to control the press here.
we can't keep them off public property.
is that why there's so many of you guys now?
Yeah, that's why there's so many of us your brother doesn't seem to mind the attention.
he just gets along better.
maybe you should talk to her about it.
well, she's still your mom the door was open.
Hey, Jim. Boy, he's had a big life, our General Keaton has.
find any scandals yet?
no, but we haven't gotten through the medals yet.
that's where these guys usually take a hit.
right.
look, uh, things seem to be coming together in the situation room.
good, great.
so I'm just going to take this off your hands.
you can get back to your first gentleman duties.
what?
come on. I don't believe this.
you're firing me?
rod, this was just a temporary assignment. -Does the president know about this?
the president doesn't need to involve herself with this kind of minutia yeah? Yeah, he's here.
you're wanted in the situation room.
Hello, Pumpkin.
what brings you here?
I wanted to show Regal where my mommy works.
could I see her?
well, I don't know.
do you have an appointment?
no.
I'm sorry, honey, but your mommy's in a meeting.
you're not going to be able to see her now but I'll let her know you came by room, attention!
everyone, General Keaton will be joining us today.
do you have some options for me?
Yes, Ma'am.
ma'am, we'll run two sections of f-15es, eight aircraft in all out of Rosie roads, Puerto Rico with a big wing strategic tanker on route.
we'll go after the specific region of San Pasquale where the D.E.A. agents were held captive. - You'll turn out the lights. - Exactly.
we'll use all tactical capacity of the eighth air force directed by southcom and shut down every communication and power grid.
and how does this get me Sanchez?
it doesn't. It weakens him, his military weakens him? You think the military is his source of power?
you're aiming at the wrong munitions plant, al.
Warren, what was it you said on the campaign?
a war on drugs is a war on drugs.
is a war on drugs?
if I can't bring Sanchez in
I will make him irrelevant,
I will take away, what makes him powerful what makes the military support him.
talk to me about eradication.
massive coca crop eradication.
talk to me about destroying all of the drug agriculture, period.
we use several dozen dusters out of Putumayo...
hit the country in a massive, coordinated strike.
and we take out the hidden cocaine labs the ones the D.E.A. agents discovered.
it's bold, decisive.
you're going after the drugs, not the citizens.
I like it.
Jim, get me airtime at 9 P.M.
I'm going to address the nation.
the intelligence oversight act requires that you confer with the gang of eight on this.
then get Templeton and the rest of them in here.
let's get this done we're anticipating the strike will take about two hours.
and how certain are we of the location of these cocaine labs?
very. The D.E.A. team did their jobs.
are there air defenses?
minimal. Suppressive fires from the a-10s will protect us.
madam president, I have sat here and listened to five presidents say that the stakes were worth American blood.
is this?
american blood has already been shed.
some might say a new president; our first female president was sending a signal.
what I am sending, Alison is strike force alpha.
madam president, it sounds to me as if your staff has not made you aware that one, all of the farmers in San Pasquale are coca farmers; two, most of the country's coca crop production is used for legitimate purposes; and three if this attack goes forward you will trigger an economic depression in that country.
and we'll incur the world's condemnation for this unilateral action again.
all options have been considered.
I'll be sending all of you an advance copy of my address.
madam president.
I can ask for nothing more.
thank you.
Mr. Calloway.
Ah, General.
you've been gone for a while.
situation room.
Oh, is everything okay?
it's going to be, yeah.
I saw something in that situation room.
it's not often that I find somebody I'm willing to follow.
look, I know I blew it in the campaign.
I didn't listen to people who knew what they were doing.
I don't want to blow it again.
this is a team that I want to be a part of so I need you to tell me what I have to do to get confirmed and I'm going to listen.
uh, mr. Gardner's going to be finishing up your prep.
okay, as long as I still have your ear.
of course, you do.
I did serve, you know.
three years in the army.
air defense.
Yeah, I kind of smelled it on you. - I'll see you tomorrow. - Okay.
the two of them together are going to be amazing.
Yes, they will.
Hey, mom.
Hey, honey.
um, what's going on?
um, I'm getting ready to address the nation.
Oh.
Hey, uh, are you okay?
I heard it was kind of rough at school today.
um, yeah, it's kind of what I wanted to talk to you about.
Yeah, well, I've already talked to the press...
mom, they can't do anything about it. - Who? - Secret service. I mean, it's public property - Rebecca... - mom, you have no idea what it was like.
I mean, there were agents everywhere and people taking pictures and screaming.
I know, I know but it's not going to always be like that.
mom, I hate it there, okay?
I mean, I always have.
I just... I want to go to school with Stacy.
you know, people like us.
people like who?
well, senators' kids, congressmen's kids.
well, see, this is exactly why I can't let that happen.
Mom--mom, please.
Rebecca, I went to public school.
your father went to public school.
right, so I have to go to public school too, so you can make some kind of political statement?
I just...
I have no friends there.
what about jenny?
what about Mimi?
mom, don't you care what I'm going through?
of course I care.
look, it's hard to live under a microscope I get that and this is not what you signed up for.
I have to get ready for this speech, okay?
let's talk later but I promise you I will do everything I can to protect you and your privacy.
right cause you've done such a great job of that so far, right, mom?
Hi, Rebecca...everything okay?
Yeah, yes. Listen thank you so much for writing this so fast.
I suppose one of these days I'll have to hire a new speechwriter or press secretary.
Yeah, look, I know you have to be pissed.
I really have not let you do your job, and I'm sorry.
you are a senior staff member now and I need to respect you as such.
from now on you're going to be included on every meeting.
uh, okay， at some point tonight.
I'm going to go off text and I want to tell you why and what I'm thinking. so when the press freaks out later -you'll know what to say to them - Okay - Good evening, everyone - Madam president - Where's...where's... - furniture's in the hall we had to make room for the camera and the teleprompter - 30-second warning, Ma'am - Thank you.
the networks are all in, they're not pleased, sweeps and all
all right, let's give the president the room, please.
if you do not play a role...
ten seconds, Ma'am.
nine...
you good? Text okay? -Yeah. That's going to work?
we'll soon know.
three, two, you're on, ma'am.
good evening.
this morning I was informed that nine agents working for the drug enforcement administration were murdered in San Pasquale.
we have accumulated compelling evidence that San Pasquale's dictator.
general Joseph Sanchez personally ordered the executions.
using information provided by the D.E.A. agents.
I have ordered our armed forces in conjunction with the D.E.A.
to destroy coca fields in San Pasquale and all known cocaine labs in the country.
this will happen in the next few hours.
our fight is not with the people of San Pasquale.
it is not my desire to destroy an agriculture that has many positive purposes so we will destroy 25% of the fields...
looks like she listened to you ...For the time being.
we will not tolerate a government in our hemisphere that is complicit with drug lords...
that's not in there ...A government killing our agents and killing our children with their poisonous drug trafficking.
until there is a new government in San Pasquale which fights drug lords instead of conspiring with them, we will continue to act to protect our children.
in a week, we'll destroy another 25% of the coca and then another 25 and then another.
shortly, the democratically elected president of San Pasquale will be in the region.
I encourage the people of San Pasquale seize your right to be governed by the leader you have already chosen. My god.
she just called for a coup.
thank you. God bless the United States of America and the citizens of San Pasquale.
we're clear, Ma'am.
thank you, everyone.
let me know when the planes are in the air.
Yes, Ma'am.
okay, okay, obviously, the president went off text in tonight's speech, so we're passing out an addendum.
did the president call for an overthrow in San Pasquale?
this president is and will always be committed to protecting the sovereignty of democratically elected governments.
however, the country of San Pasquale is run by a dictator who ordered the execution who ordered the execution of American citizens and that will not stand.
but did she call for an overthrow?
president Len would welcome the return of Juan Duran to his elected post as president of San Pasquale. hey, Kelly. I got another one...
okay, yes, thank you.
sir, the planes are an hour from target and our intercepts and ground teams are suggesting that protestors are moving into the capital city, hey.
somebody couldn't sleep.
I told her maybe she could read down here until she got sleepy.
of course. What are you reading?
Robinson Crusoe. - Mm-hmm.
did you ever read it? -Yeah, I did but I had to wait till I was 12.
anything? -Not yet the wires are reporting that mobs have descended on the presidential palace in San Pasquale.
okay, we need to get the press back.
I'll get a statement from the president you are watching live footage from San Pasquale where citizens have gathered at the presidential palace demanding the arrest of General Sanchez before American warplanes arrive to destroy cocoa fields in the country -You're certain of this? -Yes -Madam President? -Shh.
it happened
the military turned on Sanchez They arrested him -Duran? -He's ready -Let's get him in the air -Already on his way to Andrews -Turn the crop dusters around -Yes, ma'am oh, Jim the F-15s are still authorized to go after the cocaine labs.

sync: YTET-cheshirecat -==www. ydy. com/bbs==
put it on, Amy -No!
all right, listen, we had a deal, Princess Orion.
you want to wear that costume, you gotta throw the coat over it. -But I'm not cold. -It's October.
but I'm hot.
come on, you guys. Let's go. We're gonna be late.
there you go.
I'm already hot.
I know, I know.
yeah...
she's a bird, she's a plane she's off to Pierce Elementary.
all right. Have fun at school, kids -Bye, dad -Bye, daddy.
Bye-bye. See you.
Aww, missed it.
everything okay?
Yeah, fine. -You? -Yeah.
I'm about to introduce our new national security advisor.
Mm.
I was wondering if you maybe would like to sit in.-I think anthony would really enjoy.-Oh, you remember? I'm gonngo see Ken. -In Baltimore.-Ken in Baltimore. -Right. -The world series.
should be a good game. Want to go?
Yeah. I'll just blow this off.
you realize this will be my first night here without you?
just do what you normally do. -Fall dead asleep. -Mm-hmm.
maybe we could work on that when you get back.
sounds like a plan.
Well...see you tomorrow kiddo, okay?
have fun.-All right. -I hate the new guy. -You've known him two minutes.
that is long enough to know he is an unqualified kiss-ass who wears cheap cologne.
you're right.
deputy Director for Latin America at state ambassador to Venezuela, led the D.O.D. Policy board--what was she thinking?
they go way back to school.-Great.
they're bosom buddies and I have to answer to him.
I'm not the only one.
who has a problem-Justice and homeland...
only answer to Prado on domestic terrorism.
the president wants one point person on all security issues.
give her a break.
morning.
anything special I should know?
no, just the announcement. We'll take a few questions.
we already know the press agenda-the first Latino on the job fluent in six languages, worked with the president years ago.
great. See you in there. Please join me in welcoming our new national security advisor.
thank you. Thank you.
and thank you, madam president for your kind words.
I promise to serve you honorably and always provide my most honest judgment.
I know. And that's what worries me.
madam president isn't it true that Mr. Prado recommended you for your first job out of law school?
more like sold me into indentured servitude.
that firm worked me a hundred hours a week.
now it's, uh, payback time, Mr. Prado, do you think you'll approach your job differently because of your Latino background?
uh, that's hard to say, as I've never really approached a job from a white background. -Touch? Let me rephrase the question-Sorry, no more questions.
the president has a meeting now.
thank you for coming, everyone.
what's going on?
u. S. Border patrol picked up a guy trying to cross the Canadian border early this morning.
he had explosives in his car.
he's being transferred to FBI now.
we need to prepare for a real threat.
the subject,
real name is Tariq Azam,
was picked up three hours ago crossing the border at Windsor, Ontario using a false U. S. Passport,
alias Douglas Salib.
his real nationality-Saudi Arabia.
somehow Azam evaded our watch list -but we found out from the Israelis-Melanie, let Prado lead.
sorry. Not used to the new system.
what we know so far is that Azam is an Al-muharib operative trained at the Shahid Camp in Lebanon.
Al-muharib always plans simultaneous attacks and always thematically linked.
how many targets have we identified exactly?
unfortunately, only one.
his attack was scheduled for tomorrow.
Halloween-at 1: 00 in the afternoon.
the Alexander Hamilton Elementary School in Springfield, Missouri.
T. A.T. P. Explosives were hidden in the passenger seat, two timing devices concealed in a spare tire along with blueprints of the Hamilton School.
how many students there?
360, ages 5 to 12.
if we're assuming a multiple-point attack, projected casualties could be anywhere from 600 to a thousand dead.
all right, our biggest priority right now is to track down the rest of the cell.
the problem is we have no intercepts on Azam from intelligence at least ten days before an attack.
if we don't locate Azam's coconspirators before 11 A. M. Tomorrow morning other bombs will go off, as no doubt planned.
more schools?
well, if children are their targets, it could be parks, malls.
I recommend we raise the terror alert.
we do that, we tip off Azam's coconspirators that he's in custody.
that's our only advantage.
I don't want anything leaked to the press about this threat until the rest of the cell is in custody.
the last thing we need is for them to speed this up or worse, for them to alter their targets. -Who knows about the threat? -Congressional leadership.
templeton and Remarque are briefing the intelligence committee shortly.
we also had to inform the Springfield local police and the mayor of Springfield.
all advised not to talk to the press.
I'll fill Kelly in.
ma'am, it is fairly clear that the only way are going to find Azam's coconspirators before tomorrow morning. - Is if he talks. -What are the chances?
everybody talks eventually, Jim, the question is will it be soon enough?
the President today had to delay her family vacation to Camp David when husband Rod.
and this is sad.
pricked his finger trimming the white house rose garden.
wait, what did he say? Make it louder hey, what's up? Series highlights?
the new today that President Allen may give her husband Rod a new cabinet post.
he will be secretary of making her breakfast.
nice. I hope your parents don't watch this stuff.
Yeah, well, they've stopped. -Really, and why is that? -Because it's not funny.
not funny? Man, they just made your daddy the secretary of makin' breakfast.
whoa, man. - I thought you had a sense of humor. -You're gonna sit here and take this?
come on, Horace, it's just stupid jokes.
Yeah, but they're about your dad.
Oh, is that why you're actin' all weird 'cause your dad's a big wuss?
all right. - Hey, let it go.
Yeah, I guess bein' a wuss runs in the family, hey, hey!
Hey, knock it off. -Cut it out. -Knock it off. -Break it up, you've probably got some idea. Why we invited ourselves over this evening?
well, it's not totally out of left field.
well, frankly, we didn't expect congressman Reinhold to retire.
we thought he'd stick around another term. -I know Reinhold did, too. -Yeah.
Mmm. Would you like something to eat?
please. -Yeah, sure.
you know, that's an amazing wife you've got there.
she spends her days putting murderers away and then she comes home and whips up a mean cheese spread.
Yeah.
but of course, she's following the brilliant example set by -our attorney general -Mm-hmm.
I learned everything I know from him as a prosecutor and a chef well you said that you came about Reinhold.
right. If Mike Zamore wins Reinhold's seat, that would be a disaster.
and he's got the state party's backing?
all the more reason to think outside the box. -You know. -Excuse me one minute.
uh, where are you going, Mackenzie?
I just have to put the twins to bed. I'll be right back.
but you're the one we came to see.
we want you to run for congress.
I am a student. I was studying engineering. Is that how you learned how to make bombs?
I don't know what you're talking about.
we know that you don't have a sister in Green Bay.
do you have any other family in the United States?
no. No, I don't.
I've done over 200 interrogations.
this guy's not breaking anytime soon.
the Shahid camp in Bekaa Valley.
Azam trained there.
maybe there's a paper trail.
we've already got our best team of interrogators on their way out of quantico right now.
they should be landing in half an hour.
what's the status of the camp?
it's in a C. I.A. overwatch.
we've been monitoring it since 2002.
yields a lot of intel. -Ma'am, if I may.-Let's raid the camp.
we've got a team on the ground in Jordan. -Black ops guys.-Overnight.
bust down the doors and pull out whatever we can find.
justice already has this threat covered.
a covert operation like this is expensive. It's risky and it could cost lives.
no. The president's plan makes sense.
it's likely Azam met his conspirators in training.
and what's the one thing we know about these guys?
they keep the best records.
so we're just giving up on Azam, then?
we have 25 hours until bombs start going of and we have no idea where keep up the interrogation but I am not trusting the safety of our children to what happens in that room.
I'm at a loss, Melanie. What's she doing?
has mi-5 gotten into the mix?
as far as they were concerned, he's an engineering student and a devout Muslim.
and the bomb-making materials they found in his car is that enough for the President to class.
what's his name? -Azam.
to classify him as an enemy combatant?
not this, President. -I can promise you that. -Yeah.
don't forget you're scheduled to be on Gordon Blake's talk show tomorrow morning.
and we're in a crisis.
I mean, the public's gonna expect you to be swaddled in the American flag.
swaddled, no.
I'm gonna very humbly say that the president is doing everything that she can to avert this terror threat.
now you tell me, Melanie will I be lying if I say that?
I'll talk to her.
good girl. Go do it. It would be unseemly.
I cannot be seen to be critical of the President when all of this is unfolding.
but you be ready to book a couple of shows next week because if one bomb goes off tomorrow...
I'm gonna put this all on her shoulders.
the Bekaa Valley is technically a part of Lebanon. -If they find out that our guys are going in there.-- -We just have to make sure they don't.
ma'am.
the kids at Hamilton Elementary won't be going to school tomorrow.
the mayor of Springfield got scared.
he notified the principal, who notified the parents.
well, let's contain it. Try to keep it off the wire.
too late. A. P. Picked the story up already and they got a quote from the mayor confirming that it's terrorist-related.
he just tipped off Azam's cohorts.
well, he wasn't told why we were keeping this covert.
he doesn't need to know why. It should be enough the FBI told him to keep his mouth shut.
look, I'm sorry. I have a dozen reporters hounding me for details. -Keep under wraps that we have Azam in custody. -Okay.
don't mention Al-muharib, and don't bring up any other cell members or additional targets.
we handle this correctly. We can convince the collaborators. We don't know they're out there and avoid a public panic. -All right. Thanks. -Okay.
Jim, call Prado and see if we can move up the launch from Jordan.
I want to know what the risks are if we go in before nightfall.
our 25-hour window may slam shut any second but there's a possible threat of loss of life.
why weren't we informed about the threat on Springfield?
well, believe it or not, the government doesn't always share every aspect of homeland security measures.
could the government tell us how they learned of the threat?
I mean, was it routine intelligence, was it an individual in custody?
for security reasons, I can't answer that question.-- -Oh, come on, Kelly, really. -You gotta be kidding me. -No, the most important thing is that now that we know, we've taken every possible measure to avert the existing threat.
what about the New York stock exchange Lambeau Field?
as I've said, Steve, there's only one known target.
can the White House confirm the safety of these and other locations?
come on, that's a loaded question and you know it.
okay, put it another way.
does that mean that the threat has been resolved?
at this point, we don't know if it's an isolated target or part of a larger plot.
Kelly, terrorist groups have never before tried to attack a red state.
what do you think this means, them moving away from only targeting the blue states?
I think it means we should stop thinking of ourselves as red states and blue states and start thinking of ourselves as the United States.
one guess why I asked you to make the trip up.
uh, not for the pleasure of my company?
you want Mac to toss out the first ball the next opening day.
not even close.
Frank Hanford's contract is up in December.
we got a short list of ten.
you're at the top of it.
we want you to be the next commissioner of baseball.
between your extensive legal background -your leadership experience-- -my Washington connections.
sure.
those entered the discussion.
but the truth is the league needs you, Rod.
we're about legitimacy and integrity.
here's your chance to make it to the bigs to make an impact on the game that you love.
you can't tell me you don't want to. -I have obligations. -Of course.
to the president, to my kids.
no first person has ever worked outside the white house.
did Mary told Lincoln ever have this good an offer?
think about it.
if you could keep me updated on any new intelligence that comes your way. -I'd really app.-Princess Orion!
excuse me.
Amy, mommy is on the phone.
what did we say about that?
I... forgot?
I'm sorry.
again, we are keeping this internal for now. -Sorry, mommy. -It's okay.
Vince. Ohh.
Yes, ma'am.
would you escort Princess Orion back to her galaxy?
Mwah.
of course I will.
you ready, Amy?
one, two, three!
operation Orion is scheduled to begin in 45 minutes.
when should we have news?
within a couple of hours.
homeland security is recommending that we raise the terror alert nationally at least until after Halloween.
when the story hit the wires, schools began shutting immediately.
and I think if we don't do anything, we risk looking unresponsive.
how many schools have shut down exactly?
about 40% of the elementary schools, 30% of the middle and upper schools.
we don't have a number on how many parents are keeping their kids home.
teachers are calling in sick in droves.
is Azam talking?
he's still stonewalling.
why should he talk when he's being wined and dined by the anti-torture statutes?
those statutes were written for a reason.
may we have a moment in private, please, ma'am?
there are other steps that we could be taking
if we were to classify Azam as an enemy combatant. -You're advocating torture?
that is your word.-Which has not been proven to work.
more times than not, they're likely to lie. -And you know that. -You're tying my hands. -I didn't write the constitution. -The constitution is not a suicide pact.
we have a living, breathing in custody who has answers.
have homeland raise the terror alert.
Yes, ma'am Charlie, there's absolutely nothing to talk about.
I remember it. You remember nothing -No, you remember nothing. -I remember it well.
off with their heads! You don't remember that.
come on, man. -Hey, Kelly. -Hi, Charlie.
Alex, can I borrow you for a second?
Yeah.
later.
look...
Alex, what happened today? -It can't happen again. -Whoa, whoa. Slow down what are you talking
the president tells me explicitly what to say and what not to say. -And if you're not in on those things.-I ought to be. -You are, a lot of the times, but,-no, no, I ought to be in and you ought to be out.
that's right.
I'm not the only one who thinks so.
why don't you go ask our friends in the press corps?
you're still upset the president gave me the job.
upset?
upset, that I, a Harvard graduate was passed over by someone who, a month ago thought a lid was something you put on lattes?
look, I know it's hard.-- -No, you don't.
you don't know anything.
and I'm sick and tired of taking orders from some U. C. Santa Barbara Pi Beta Phi who majored in rushing and minored in getting on her knees.
or I'm--I'm sorry, do I have that backwards?
did you minor in rushing?
don't come in tomorrow.
all right, look, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, okay? I just--I'm just,
you know, I'm drunk -Yeah, you're just.
you know fired.
and next time check your sources.
I was born in Santa Barbara. I graduated from Princeton.
so what, you're too good to go trick-or-treating?
no, not too good. Just...
I--too old -Nah. Never too old.
well, besides, if I go, it'll be a huge production.
I mean, secret service and what not and oh, probably press.
you sure?
cause I make a pretty convincing Dracula, oh, yes, I'm sure.
I want to suck your blood.
God, you're beautiful.
are you leaving on your own -or should I call Rebecca's agents? -Mom. Um...
madam President, it's an honor to meet you.
it would be more of an honor if you weren't in my daughter's bedroom at 11 P. M.
this is Mike Fleming, and we were just studying. -Ma'am? -Would you please show this young man out?
Yeah. Uh, thank you.
Thanks, Sam.
mom, Mike's a good guy.
you're 16.
more relevant, he's 16 -17.
well, okay, then.
but he's a-a total gentleman and a good guy and a good friend.
I mean, mom, you should've seen him.
I've seen enough, thank you.
no, I-I mean today at school with Horace. He completely defended him.
why did Horace need defending?
because kids at school were making fun of dad.
all quiet on the home front?
can I have the C. I.A. Shift their overwatch to Rebecca's room?
two Chinooks, four helos total.
we'll be entering Lebanese airspace within the next 15 minutes.
shall I update you each step?
I won't be sleeping.
Yes, ma'am.
Mr. Weaver.
were you able to reach the first gentleman, ma'am?
not yet.
will the children be going to school tomorrow?
I think they should stay home.
very good, ma'am.
if I can ask...
should I tell my daughter to keep my grandchildren back as well?
that I can't answer.
seems like most people plan to attention!
everyone.
what do you have for me, Mr. Secretary?
the Orion team is back on the ground in Jordan debriefing and sorting.
casualties?
there were two wounded, one seriously.
thank you. Please sit.
the preliminary assessment is very promising.
they got over 300 data CDs, ten hard drives, a stack of paper files.
we're fairly confident that they'll be able to decode and identify -all of Azam's consipirators -But when? Next week?
Azam's attack was scheduled for 1 P. M. Central.
it's already 4 A. That gives us 10 hours.
ma'am, Azam still remains our most valuable asset.
it is my strong recommendation that he spend some time with the Kilo Charlie team. -They just got back from-- -from Afghanistan, I know.
it's a matter of expertise.
FBI agents spend maybe ten weeks learning to fight terrorism within very strict parameters.
now obviously, you agree with this since just yesterday you decided that justice should answer to N. S.C. on domestic terrorism issues.
I think we wait for news from Amman.
but it could be days...
or weeks.
Yeah.
hand him over.
but, Melanie.
I don't want to hear that he was tortured.
do you understand me?
perfectly.
thank you.
I bet you don't know who that is.
her name is Amy, too.
she used to live here.
a long time ago when her daddy was the president you know what Amy used to do for Halloween?
she'd have a party and I was thinking maybe we should do the same thing.
have a party and go trick-or-treating?
mm, I was thinking just the party.
but I'm going with Abigail, and Luke's coming.
I wish people could celebrate the way they want to but there are some bad guys that are trying to ruin Halloween and it's my job as a mommy to make sure that you're safe.
are you gonna catch all the bad guys?
Oh, I hope so. -Before tonight?
I'm going to do my best, I promise.
I bet Princess Orion could catch them right away, though, huh?
I'm gonna go take this off.
so we know it's Al-muharib.
that means more than one target, right?
at least, but we have no idea where.
who's your source?
do you have anyone in custody?
if I'm not a part of this, what am I doing?
do you have any idea why I was calling you why I couldn't sleep?
it's not just 'cause of the threat.
Amy is distraught because I destroyed Halloween.
Rebecca is entertaining boys in her room.
horace got into a fight.
okay, look.
I didn't mean the kids. I just.
what's... "Entertaining," exactly?
I handled Rebecca but you should talk to Horace. -A fight, huh? -Greer called it an incident.
will you talk to Horace, please?
sure.
what was it that you wanted to talk to me about? What happened in Baltimore?
Oh, nothing you need to worry about.-Hey -Hey. Whatcha doing?
just trying to find a horror movie for tonight.
best I'm gonna do for Halloween, considering.
I heard you got in a fight.
I want to know what happened.
did he insult you?
your sister?
your mom?
me?
pretty easy target these days.
okay, listen, Horace, I know it's an adjustment but I am proud of what I am doing here -and you do not need to defend me-yeah, well, someone's gotta.
you're a national joke, dad.
no one's even noticed that mom is the first female president because they're too busy laughing at her wuss of a husband.
what did you just say to me?
you heard me.
wait a minute. Don't you walk away from me?-Just forget it.-Wait a minute.
think I can forget what you just said to me?
dad, I didn't mean to.-Get outta here!
Hey, Gordon. This me?
right there. -You look good. -Thanks.
you look really good.
I think I've lost a few pounds since you've seen me last.
it's more than that. You taking that little blue pill?
no. Come on now. Come on. -You're blushing
no, so we'll toss around a few things.
I'm sure you'll want to get into the vouchers bill. We'll talk about that.
anything. Whatever you'd like. It's your show.
I'm sorry if I'm a little.
I've just-off the record?
thank you. Thanks.
I've just come out of the Intel meeting on this Missouri business. -It's always scary. -We're on in ten. -These sessions...our president-we should get into that.
Oh, god, you know, please.
don't put me on the spot. You know me and my mouth.
and you're on.
Hello, I'm Gordon Blake, and this is speaker of the house.
this is "the war room."
speaker, tell me is the President of the United States soft on terrorism?
you're dealing from the bottom of the deck, Gordon.
there's a terror alert in the country.
it would be very remiss of me to, in any way, criticize the president at a time like this.
well, can you look into that camera, our audience and tell America, "Not worry. Your children will
you're incorrigible.
now you're asking me to speak for the President and her N. S.C. Team because that's where the security of the country lies. It lies with her.
I'm not going to tell the President what to do, not on national television, anyway.
what I can say and I am confident that the President would agree with me saying it is that this is not a time for politics.
this is the time for the President to do everything within her power to keep Americans alive.
do you have any other family in the United States?
no. No, I don't.
in Canada?
no.
we know you're a Saudi citizen. -We know about your brother... -I'm pretty new here.
but I'm fairly sure you're not supposed to be doing this. -I'm sorry, ma'am. -Just be thankful I caught you and not Jim.
it's just I was wondering and curious at how it was going with the prisoner.
we're sending him for more aggressive interrogation. -Good. -Pardon me?
well, I mean, if,
it means stopping him and nabbing other terrorists then why not do whatever it takes?
frankly, I am surprised to hear you say that.
you're very strong on Palestinian rights.
Yes, ma'am. Yes, I am. I'm just not very big on terrorists having rights.
there's a difference, and thanks to them, people don't see that.
I say boil the bastard alive.
weren't you in Baltimore?
business or pleasure?
started out as pleasure.
want to swap lives?
I don't, uh...
I don't think you'd make a good baseball commissioner.
I got offered the job.
Wow. Can you believe that?
Yeah. When did that happen? That's fantastic.
what are you going to do?
it's, uh, it's complicated. -Yeah.
a little.
I mean, the truth is there's no legal reason I can't take that job.
you might be happier.
plus Horace must be jazzed. That's every boy's dream.
Yeah.
Oh, I gotta go. Aren't those for Amy?
didn't I ask you to get Anthony?
Yes, ma'am. -Then why isn't he here?
well, because you would ask him why he doesn't have any updates and I thought I would spare him the seventh trip down the hall.
why doesn't he have any updates?
you see "the war room" this morning? -No. Why?
gordon Blake had Templeton on and he implied -that if anything happened it'll be on your.-Well, I don't want to get into any political games with Templeton.
don't take the bait.
if we're lucky, my second day might be better than the first.
we've got names of coconspirators and specific school targets.
question is, can we round them up in time?
we have the entire cell in custody.
but as a precaution, we're keeping heightened security at the other target schools in.
bloomington, Hillsboro and Fort Worth.
I want to visit all four schools on Monday.
I'll set it up.
so... that's it.
I don't know about you people, but I could not pull another all-nighter.
I don't bounce back like I did when I was in college. -Ask Anthony. -I think you did just fine.
operation Orion was an inspired move, not to mention aptly named but at what cost?
two black ops in the hospital millions of dollars and the loss of Shahid training camp as a future source of Intel.
and I can assure you, the foreign minister of Lebanon will be canceling his visit to the White House next month.
and I can assure you that on Monday morning when I'm saying the pledge with the children of Alexander Hamilton Elementary, I will not be regretting any of my actions.
absolutely, ma'am.
my point is simply. We have limited resources and there are limitless threats.
and in the end, I got the same list of coconspirators from Azam's interrogation.
plus...
coordinates of safe houses they may use in the future.
what's done is done.
the important thing is you just diverted the first major threat of your administration, Madam President.-Congratulations. -Congratulations, congratulations.
thank you.
Hi. You look so cute.
is it too late to have the party?
Oh, baby, this is what you wanted to do.
it's going to be really, really fun.
what's the matter, honey? You still scared?
maybe it's okay to be a little scared on Halloween.
you caught all the bad guys, right?
we wouldn't let you go if it wasn't safe. You know that.
are you sure you can't come?
Yeah. Pete and Eddie aren't going to let me come.
but daddy's going to come with you.
Mm-hmm. And mommy's going to have a huge jar of candy corn to share with us when we get back. -Half a jar, maybe. -You better go.
come on, happy Halloween.
that Amy's stash?
Yeah. You want some?
no, thanks.
about earlier...
I'm sorry I said...
what I said. But...
but what?
you're the son of the President, Horace.
people are going to have opinions.
you can't go after every jerk who has a wiseass remark.
I didn't have a choice.
and I say you do.
Yeah.
madam President.
well... bloody hell.-It's been really something. -Uh, yeah. It has a defining moment for you, for us, for all of us.
I think it's at times like these we're all independents.
I just wanted to say to you you did good.
well, thank you.
that, uh...that means a great deal to me. Thank you very much.
when I think of how close we came...
anyway, what's his name? Azam talked and that's what's important.
intelligence oversight.
I see the same secret papers you do.
I'm subject to the same code of silence you are, and I will not speak a word.
it is, after all, unspeakable.
but this is the business we've chosen-this business of leading paying the price for the greater good.
Mr. Speaker, what the hell are you talking about?
madam President, just you and me...
no one else here...
I'm trying to tell you that I am proud of you.
you understand the burdens of the necessary evil.
I didn't think that was part of your makeup.
I was wrong.
I was trying to congratulate you.
well, good night, Nathan.
good night.
Congratulations.
sleep well.
ma'am?
what happened with Azam?
he talked. -Why did he talk?
I told you, Kilo Charlie was better equipped-better equipped with what, electrodes?
I said there was to be no torture. -You cannot.-You said no such thing.
you said you didn't want to hear about torture.
presidents don't speak in metaphors. "I don't want to hear" means "I don't want to hear."
is he alive?
barely. Other than that I don't care or give a damn.
I do. -If I thought there were another way-we found another way.
there's always another way.
I am not prepared to ever accept torture.
then perhaps you're not prepared to be president.
do you really think that what you did was right?
I am not going to have any trouble sleeping tonight, if that's what you mean.
could you have done it yourself?
I mean, why send him to a special military unit?
why not dot right here in the Oval office?
strap him down to my desk?
because that's what you did, Melanie.
he wanted to kill our children and you would have had to see the corpses of our children and when you saw them, you would have said to yourself one thing "I would have given anything to have prevented this."
well, you did.
principles mean little when we're the only ones playing by the rules.
those bastards don't deserve our protection.
the rules are not there to protect them.
they're to protect us.
other nations follow us.
if we torture, there is nothing to prevent other countries from doing the same to our citizens.
understood.
you are relieved of your duties.
madam President,
I spoke to Melanie, if you need me, I will be in my office.
thank you.
okay, I'm here on the west side.
I'm in the back. Hurry up.
copy.
no, Travis. No gun.
stun guns? For real?
is he in there?
Yeah, he's in there.
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, Travis.
on three. Okay, one, two...
three!
gotcha.
don't want none of this! - Don't mess with the police department.
did you get him? Did you get him?
he's so cute.
no, no, no, he's not cute.
actually, he is kinda cute.
so what if he's cute?
he burrowed a hole through my roof.
and chewed through the wiring.
Oh, what are you going to do with him?
we? - Yeah.
Oh, that's really sweet of you guys.
right. No, it's not a problem.
so I'm gonna grab my toolbox, I'll come back and fix your light for you, okay?
Oh, I'll just call an electrician.
no, no, no, I'm the one that installed it.
might as well be the one to fix it.
okay. - Okay.
thank you for helping, Travis.
not a problem.
Alex, let me know anytime you want to get rid of any, uh, pest.
funny. Can we go?
Yeah.
these are supposed to remain anonymous, so no guessing who wrote what.
I am afraid I am invisible.
she said "no guessing."
that's right, that's the whole point these fears are universal.
any one of us could have written that.
I think being invisible would be awesome.
I am afraid of a world without my beautiful wife.
I am afraid this session will never end.
don't look at me. Anybody could have written that.
is there someplace you have to be, Wes?
Yes, actually, there is.
I promised my... I promised Alex that I'd fix her portico light.
why doesn't she just hire someone?
because it's tough to find someone reliable.
so she asked you? - No.
she didn't have to ask me, okay?
I noticed it was broken, so I'm fixing it.
commendable, Wes, but it does raise the question: why are you still trying to insert yourself in your ex-wife's life?
well, he's certainly not gonna let anyone else insert himself into Alex's life.
I care about the house because I own half of it, okay?
you do? Why?
okay, who here thinks that Wes has not moved on?
a lie.
seriously, Tara?
you said if it came to my backhand you'd take it.
Hey, that's game and set, guys. One, love.
Yeah. Yeah, good game.
um, why don't we take five before switching sides.
Hey, why don't you go get that ball, okay?
this guy's a nightmare.
why don't we make a deal right now?
you don't have to play any more tennis, I don't have to sleep through any more community theater.
Oh, my God.
what is it?
no, Tara, don't...
you're the one who treats dating like a competitive sport.
we should be talking about you in group, not me.
my relationships involve two mutually-participating parties.
yours don't. That's why we talk about you.
you have a problem moving on.
and all you do is move on.
officer Pratt, Detective Travis Marks. You're new.
just got out of the Academy.
welcome to the LAPD.
all right, there were no witnesses.
victim is in her early 30s, and no one's seen her play here before, yeah?
the people at the rec center said they'd never seen her before.
how did you know all that?
she's wearing brand-new sneakers, not a scuff mark on them.
and if there were any witnesses, they'd be here giving a statement to the police.
anyone find her tennis racket?
no. No cell phone, no purse, no I. D. either.
maybe it was a robbery gone wrong.
definitely not. She's still wearing her jewelry.
look at that.
price tag.
are you kidding me? What a shame.
of course I remember her, Darby Jensen.
Yeah, she kept coming in here buying up stuff and then returning it.
first it was yoga, then rock climbing, cycling.
you know, all she cared about was how good she looked in the outfit.
that's 'cause she wasn't trying to find a sport.
she was trying to find a man.
Oh, she hit on me a few times, too.
did she ever come in here with anyone?
no, she was always alone.
you know, personally, I don't think we should have a return policy.
it just turns people into quitters.
you gotta pick a sport and stick with it.
look at me. I've been lifting for 20 years.
go ahead. Touch it.
you'll break your finger. That's rock hard.
go ahead, Wes. Touch it.
I'll take his word for it. I don't need to touch it.
you know, you never take anyone's word for it.
why take his? - I'll take it.
I will break my finger. I believe you.
sure? - Yeah, I'm positive.
do you have Darby Jensen's address?
thank you so much.
she said she was going on a tennis date.
did she say with whom?
no, but she was very careful.
she worked in computer security, ran background checks for employment agencies.
did it for me for prospective tenants.
poor Darby. I'll miss her.
she was quiet.
paid her rent on time.
okay. Thank you very much.
the city of Los Angeles appreciates your cooperation.
you have a good one. Watch yourself.
all right, got, uh, daily affirmations.
your soul mate is out there." "Dream. Believe. Achieve.
you think Captain Sutton killed her?
look what I found. Credit card statement.
Darby Jensen joined DateSalon. com.
that explains all the dates.
she was online dating, huh?
so where's her computer?
it's gonna be real hard without that computer to find out who she was dating.
it'll be even tougher considering Ellen in Forensics isn't speaking to you.
Ellen... is sensitive.
Ellen is not sensitive.
she's angry at you because you dumped her.
you think maybe there's a lesson to be learned there?
Yes, Wes, and maybe one you should know.
exes can't be friends. - Really?
Alex and I are friends. You and Ellen are not exes.
we were together, she sewed my name in her panties, and now we're not.
that doesn't make...
was that you, little baby?
hello.
Milo." You're a pretty girl.
maybe you should take her to coffee?
Oh, call Animal Control for this cat.
what? No. No, no, no, no. They'll just put her down.
you want another victim on your hands?
this kitten was a dead woman's best friend.
it was her only friend.
we'll notify next of kin.
Darby had no next of kin. She was all alone - Here. - Oh, sorry. Can't. I'm allergic.
I don't know.
according to the credit card company, Darby's screen name is... "IM4U."
wasn't really playing hard to get, was she?
well, how coy can you be when you're on a dating site?
true. - We need a password.
how about "Catlady"?
didn't work.
try "Milo."
and you need to hide the cat because the captain's coming through.
Hey, Captain, you looking extra fit today.
well, that was weird.
weirder than normal?
Yeah.
but helpful maybe.
what was Darby's daily affirmation?
your soul mate is out there, dream... Soul mate.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's try it.
bingo. We're in.
all right.
hmm. She's a busy girl. Three dates this week. Three different guys.
Cycleguy, Rockurworld, and Raceya.
all right. We need to set up a dummy account with a woman with the same traits as Darby, e-mail these guys, see if anyone bites.
we need a photo. Who's our prettiest cop?
prettiest cop that's still speaking to you?
Hey, where's Amy? - Break room.
hello.
Hey, you want to babysit? I got to... got to go follow a lead.
Aw. Sure. She's cute. Me-me-me-me.
Hey, Kate, don't get too attached now.
she's, she's got to go to Animal Control.
what? Aw.
ten bucks says she adopts. - You're on.
no. You know what, Travis, you're not getting her back.
she's coming home with me.
nicely played.
woman and strays.
what do you want?
just, uh, something for the "hot cop" calendar.
charming. Make sure to send me a copy for the harassment hearing.
speaking of, there's a new girl in Forensics, she's looking for you.
new girl?
hands where I can see them. Don't touch anything.
Where's Ellen? - She left.
apparently she was allergic to douche bags.
you can put your hands down. I was kidding.
I'm Kendall, your new digi-forensics geek.
fresh from Quantico.
I wouldn't say "geek." I'm Travis.
I know who you are.
you're one of the therapy guys, right?
hilarious.
anyways, um, I have Scooter here working on your missing computer case.
scooter. All right, maybe a little geeky.
so it's gonna take some time, and maybe a subpoena or two, but I think that I can get into her cloud.
her cloud?
Yeah, it's a web-based file hosting service.
if your victim was indeed a computer nerd, then she would've backed up all of her files on the Internet in cloud storage.
you play Apocalypse Moon?
I mean, when I have a chance.
what's your screen name?
but, I mean, don't go looking for me.
guys get kind of weird when I outplay them.
I doubt you'd outplay me... LoneRider.
never heard of you.
but, I mean, there's a million players online.
so... Yeah. Yeah.
there's a new girl in Forensics.
Yeah, Kendall. I know, I met her.
when were you gonna tell me about her?
can you not ruin another professional relationship.
I'm professional.
any messages yet?
on our fake dating account?
the only attention Amy's profile has gotten is from a guy who enjoys water sports, and Ham radio.
nothing from our three suspects yet.
you know, you should join online dating.
meeting some one online is ridiculous.
tell that to Cory J.
she is ridiculous.
and by "ridiculous," I mean stupid hot.
you want to know something about Cory J, Travis?
she's not real. She's a specifically selected photo and a highly crafted description.
with a great list of hobbies.
she's a big lie.
forget about Ms. Right and experiment with Ms. Right now.
I like Mandy.
Oh, she looks willing.
Oh, Tracy. Oh, racy Tracy.
you little bad girl. Stop it.
then we got A... Oh, uh...
what?
nothing.
what happened to the blow-by-blow?
that joke's only so funny.
what are you hiding?
you were being you and offensive, and then you stopped and you clicked that three times.
what... go back three clicks.
I think you should go back to your own computer.
okay.
Oh, my God. Amy looks cold in that blouse.
that's Alex.
Hey, our fake account worked.
look. We got a date, man. Cycleguy read our profile and he wants to meet up.
tomorrow. Spin class.
Yeah, that's good.
come on. Come on.
how's it going?
it's going fine. Everything's good. I mean, I brought the wrong part.
but I'll come back tomorrow and I can fix it.
you know, I can call someone.
you really don't have to...
Oh, so you don't need me to fix your wiring anymore?
fine.
Wes, you know that's not what I said.
maybe you can have someone from DateSalon. com fix your wiring. An electrician maybe.
I read your profile.
you what? - I didn't mean to do it.
I'm working on a case, we were scanning the site, and I ran across it.
we're divorced, Wes. I'm allowed to date.
of course you are. I know that.
I just don't want you to get hurt, okay?
online dating can be really dangerous.
and believe me... there are a lot of people out there who are not what they say they are.
well, I'm careful. Okay? I always... meet my dates in a neutral place.
okay. Okay?
great. That's good.
so, always... how many dates is that... mean?
happiness.
curiosity.
you did know she was dating though, right, Wes?
anxiety.
of course he knew. They've been divorced for a year.
surprise.
I don't think he knew.
Travis, did he know?
suspicion.
he knew.
he just didn't want to know.
isn't that called denial?
is it?
look, I don't mind that Alex has a dating profile.
I mind that it's full of lies. Okay?
are they lies, or are they truths you're not willing to see?
look, that's really enlightened sounding and everything, but she said she hated jazz in her online profile...
we went to see jazz all the time.
she loved jazz.
Oh, honey.
that's what makes a good marriage.
no way she lied to me. There's just no way.
well, we all do things we don't necessarily like for the people we love.
it's not lying, it's just being polite.
technically, it's called the presentational self.
I mean, we all do it at some point to some degree.
we hide who we really are in order to be loved and accepted.
Alex and I, we were honest with each other.
so I wouldn't let what you read on Alex's profile color your perception of your time together.
Yeah. Yeah.
I think what you guys are doing could be called entrapment.
you're not supposed to put up a fake profile.
Ah, like you did?
your profile pic was taken like ten years ago.
look, I already told you Darby never showed up for our date, okay? Seriously.
I never met her. - You can prove that?
Yeah, sure.
after waiting for her for 45 minutes in the bar, took the waitress home instead.
she'll vouch for me.
we're gonna need a name and number, all right?
name was, um... let me see.
sherry... uh... Sharon... Ooh, Sheila.
how could I forget her?
you have this active of a social life, you're still going online for dates?
buddy, DateSalon. com is a stocked pond.
most of the women are rebounders.
crappy marriages, bad boyfriends, whatever the reason, they haven't had any strange in a long time.
they're real desperate to get between the sheets.
simple yes or no would've sufficed.
there she is. Sheryl.
you know, you should join up.
it's like shooting fish in a barrel.
I'll think about that.
hello.
medical examiner's report came in.
please don't sit on my... coat.
time of death is approximately 10: 00 p. m. Tuesday night.
Yeah, that's great. Listen, me and Kendall totally hooked up last night.
how professional of you.
no, not like that. It was online.
we played Apocalypse Moon.
she shot me in the face. It was insane.
I can't believe you waste a single second of your life playing a video game.
no, Apocalypse Moon is a form of social interaction, man.
for kids. - Hey, Kendall.
Hi, Wes. Travis.
pretty good shooting last night. - Don't get weird on me.
I got full access to DateSalon. com.
Raceya and Rockurworld, also known as Ted Houseman and Paul James.
um, I haven't managed to access Darby's cloud yet.
it's encrypted.
she knew what she was doing, but I'll find the encryption code.
it's got to be in there somewhere.
I love a challenge.
so do I.
thank you, Kendall.
I don't believe it.
she likes you.
everybody likes me.
people on Ecstasy don't even like you.
that's rude.
excuse me?
we're looking for a, uh, Ted Houseman.
lessons are $500 an hour, and that's with the police discount.
you teach cops how to drive?
the good ones. Ted's been pretty booked up since he was named Metal Pedal Magazine Driver of the Year, but I'm sure I can fit you in.
we don't actually need a lesson.
we're investigating a homicide.
Hey, boss, I got two cops here who want to see you.
impressive.
you stood your ground.
and one more foot, and we would have shot you.
what can I do for you?
Yeah, I met her about a week ago.
we didn't hit it off.
she looked good on paper, but in person, not my type.
where you were Tuesday night around 10: 00 p. m?
10: 00 p. m? I was in the last lap of the AutoCross Pro-Am.
couple hundred witnesses.
are you guys sure you don't want a lesson?
I am Driver of the Year.
no. We know how to drive.
thank you.
Yeah, cops always think they do, but they really don't.
now on to bachelor number three.
what does this Rockurworld do for a living?
his profile says that Paul James is a chemist.
which probably means he's a bartender.
no one pretends to be a chemist to get women.
did you see Raceya guy was, like, five, nine at best?
his profile said he was six, three.
will you get over it, man? People exaggerate. - Liar.
just doesn't make sense.
people will eventually figure that out.
why do you lie?
to get laid.
makes sense.
you hear that?
LAPD. Open up!
what the hell. This isn't the guy.
why were you running? - You were chasing me.
because you were running!
only because you were chasing me.
I can't breathe!
it's not the guy.
dude, you ran first.
then we chased you. - Don't think so. What?
look, that's not even the point.
innocent people do not run from the cops.
Yeah, they do, when they see two guys with guns ready to strong-arm a door.
you guys are scary.
I mean, not up close.
up close you look... real nice.
friendly even.
Travis, you can't.
no. We don't have probable cause.
it's not the guy.
get out of here.
Thanks. Yeah.
have a nice day.
I'm coming!
morning, ma'am. Is Paul James here?
he's not home. - Yes.
who are you? - Paul's mother.
of course. Of course, he lives with his mother.
the psychological profile just writes itself.
Oh, yeah. Laugh.
I can't wait for the freeloader to get out of the damn nest.
I even signed him up on a dating site just to get him out of the house.
you set up his date profile?
Yeah. He had his first date the other night, too.
said he liked the girl.
maybe they'll get married, and he'll move out.
ma'am, is that your son?
Yeah. That's Paulie.
you used a fake profile pic.
we had him.
paul always keeps it locked.
there. Wait here.
I haven't been in his room in two years.
that's a lot of pot.
at least Paul's mom wasn't lying about him being a chemist.
of sorts. Explains why he was running.
are you kidding me?
so, this is what he's up to.
that boy's gonna start paying me rent.
《Home Guide to Assisted Suicide》.
no offense, lady, but your son's creepy.
Paul's into medical innovation.
was Paul into tennis?
hmm, sports aren't his thing.
Yup, still got the Action Hut price tag on it.
looks like Darby's racket.
you recognize this?
Yeah, it's the same as the, uh, patch Paul has on his knapsack.
backpack. - Same thing.
not really. - What's your point?
I think I know where Paul is. - Yeah?
so, let me handle this.
you know how you get about marijuana.
Oh, please. Medical marijuana is legal.
I don't have an opinion on it.
you have an opinion on everything.
people get paranoid.
they're gonna be able to tell we're cops.
just watch.
can I help you?
Hey, man. - Cops.
these guys spoke at my high school.
stop hassling us, pig.
our pot is legal.
come on, quit treading on my Constitution, man.
no one's treading on your Constitution, all right.
we don't care about your drugs, man.
we are looking for Paul James, that's it.
paul James. Anyone see him? Anyone know Paul?
I'm Paul.
I'm Paul James.
I'm Paul James.
I'm Paul right here.
Yeah, I'm Paul James. - You get it, man?
we're all Paul.
you're Paul? - I'm Paul James.
well, you know, then you're under arrest. All right?
in fact, if you're all Paul, then you're all under arrest for murder.
murder? - Yeah, murder.
you're going to prison for life.
sorry. This smell makes me unstable.
Understand？ he's getting unstable?
okay, so, listen, where's Paul?
Yeah, I went out with Darby, but I didn't kill her. I liked her.
a lot. - After one date, she gave you her tennis racket?
Yeah, she-she didn't even play tennis.
that's what's so great about her.
our online profiles were filled with lies, but our real personalities made us a match.
until she found out you were a pot dealer.
no, she already knew about that.
she did a background check before our date.
she checked everybody she dated.
you know, a couple of those guys sounded sketchy.
have you talked to them?
what?
where were you Tuesday night?
after your date with Darby?
I was at home.
with your mother?
no. She was on a booze cruise.
she's got a substance abuse problem.
well, now she has a son problem.
he's under arrest. For what?
for murder.
murder.
not the pot?
Hey, Cap, how's it going?
honestly, boys, I don't really know.
Ooh, you need some help with something?
Nah, not with this mystery.
you working on a case?
Wes, a man's inner journey is his alone.
but I appreciate the support.
should we be worried or ignore the problem and hope it goes away?
I'm a fan of the second approach.
Oh. Hey!
you signed on.
don't be ridiculous. I'm just... ...following up on a lead here.
who's being ridiculous?
me or the guy who's still working a case we just solved?
well, it was a little too easy. Something's off.
Yeah, it only seemed easy because we're really awesome cops.
it was actually quite difficult.
Darby Jensen never dated a guy named TangoPhil.
whoa. You are stalking your ex. - I am not.
Wes! - I am not!
she's going to get a restraining order against you.
no. What are you...?
I am not stalking Alex.
I am stalking the man who plans to date Alex, and those are very different things.
you're stalking her... You're going to get this guy right now?
you don't have to come.
it's dinnertime. Go eat a burrito.
don't do this.
if we leave now, no one has to know you invaded Alex's privacy.
I just want to ask him a few questions.
Alex is not even here.
it's just a guy giving a dance lesson.
does he look single to you?
scumbag's a dead man.
so... are you single or aren't you?
wait, who are you?
we are DateSalon. com police, all right?
we do random checks to make sure that our clients are telling the truth online.
don't we?
don't we?
Yeah, most sites overlook liars, but we pride ourselves on 100% honesty, pal, ha.
are you guys for real? Is this for real?
did you just ask me if this is for real?
you agreed to the terms and conditions.
you did read the terms and conditions, right?
come on, man, nobody reads those things.
not good. Didn't read the T and C.
not good, not good. Not good.
he probably clicked the box, too.
Oh, I know he clicked the box.
all right, you got a choice.
you can either tell us the truth now or you can tell us the truth after some motivation.
I only took French in high school, I hate museums, and I'm only online for the sex. My wife totally froze me out.
y-your wife?
thank you, officers.
I do tango-- that part is true.
I just felt compelled, you know... out of the blue, to come clean.
thanks for understanding, Alex.
Yeah, yeah. Bye.
well, she canceled our date.
good, you don't deserve her.
please don't make me call my wife.
she'll kill me if she finds out the truth.
okay.
wait, wait, wait.
and what if Paul was telling the truth in the interrogation?
I mean, what if Darby got killed because she found out the truth about one of these other dates?
we never found Darby's computer in Paul's apartment, right, and why would he steal it?
everyone but his mother knew he was growing pot.
no big secret, but what if one of her other dates did have a secret?
Yeah, but even if the killer's motive is on Darby's computer, it's impossible to access, encrypted in her cloud.
there's a code somewhere. Maybe she hid it.
where? The house was thoroughly searched.
she could have given it to a friend.
Yeah, but Darby didn't have any... Except one.
Yes, little Milo.
Travis, whatever it is, the answer is no.
is Milo there?
Yes, Milo is still here, and no, you can't have her back.
I don't want her back, I just need you to look in her locket.
we think Darby's encryption code might be hidden in there somewhere.
Yep, you found your encryption code.
I'll get it to Kendall.
okay, we got it.
you guys are brilliant.
the encryption code led us to this guy Ted Houseman.
the driving instructor.
his real name is Roger Williams.
the FBI have been looking for him for seven years.
he was allegedly the driver in a Swiss bank heist, and the thieves got away with over 100 million Euros.
must have found out Darby knew.
motive. - Ted also has an alibi.
there were over 200 people at the AutoCross Race, remember?
200 people saw a guy in a helmet get in a car.
Thanks.
makeup, let's finish up.
is Ted's double ready?
okay, let's get the helicopter fired up for the aerial.
what is that car doing in my shot?
don't reset it, don't reset it.
okay, ladies, you look so lovely.
the photo shoot is canceled.
we need to talk to Ted.
no, you can talk to me.
no, we want to talk to-- Ted! Don't do it.
should we say Roger Williams? Ah.
go, go, go!
alley-oop at Pacific. Go, go!
get out of the car!
get out of the car and get your hands up!
...keep your hands in the air!
we took a look at the AutoCross Race last Tuesday.
you came in second to last.
driver of the Year usually finishes first or something, right?
we got to looking at the helmets and everything.
it could have been anyone driving.
Roger Williams, you're under arrest for the murder of Darby Jensen.
need some help?
Oh, always.
that a new hairstyle?
Mike, Wes and Travis are doing fine.
you don't have to keep checking on them.
okay.
Hey, look, uh, now that I am here, any chance I can run something by you?
of course.
I think Helen's cheating on me.
that's direct.
what makes you think that?
I was washing her car and I found a receipt in the ashtray.
lunch in Temecula.
I see.
we don't know anyone in Temecula.
Mike, we've talked about boundaries.
I know, but the detective side sometimes overwhelms the husband side.
well, before we look for the nefarious, why don't we have a look at why you might be feeling this way?
do you still feel that Helen is too good for you?
is the sun too hot to walk on with bare feet?
I'm gonna take that as a very poetic yes.
if we undervalue ourselves, then we allow others to undervalue us as well.
Yeah.
you know, and I haven't been doing my affirmations as much.
I think you need some homework.
I want you to take Helen out on a date, just the two of you.
enjoy each other's company.
let her see the fantastic, courageous man that she married.
okay.
so what's the project today-- fence, garden?
here to aerate the lawn?
no, no.
uh, here.
what's this?
it's a handyman.
he's reliable and he does good work, and I ran a background check on him, so he's okay.
does this mean you're not going to be coming around as much?
Yeah, I think so.
take care.
look at you, hard at work.
what are you working on?
are you hiding something?
I have 47 e-mails.
Yeah, that is weird.
and they're all from DateSalon. com.
detectives Mitchell and Marks, Robbery Homicide.
got yourself a little stand-off here?
Yeah, knucklehead robbed a liquor store, fled our squad cars; now he's holed up in this warehouse.
we got a dozen or so cops and one shooter. What are you waiting for?
that was a warning!
if you don't back off, I'll kill her! I swear!
he took the clerk as a hostage.
my guys can storm the back entrance and take him out, but we're going to need a distraction.
how much time you need?
give me 15 seconds. I'll bring you that shooter.
15 seconds, all right.
you ready? - Me?
Hey, you're the one with all the people skills, not me.
who told you that? - You tell me that every day.
now's your chance to prove it.
look... I'm going to have eyes on him so if anything goes sideways, I'll let you know. Okay?
Hey, are you telling me the amazing Travis Marks can't buy us 15 seconds?
it'll be okay. Trust me.
we good? - We got it.
it's not because I don't trust you.
it's just that if I let you do the talking, there'd be gunshots within ten seconds.
I just said that. - All right, you ready?
stop stalling!
okay, stay away!
okay, is this thing on?
all right, I'm talking to the guy on the third floor with the gun.
I'm going to stand up now and all I want is for you not to shoot me, emphasis on "not.
we good?
drop the gun, cop!
okay... gun's down. Gun's down.
and your vest!
shut up!
okay, so here's the thing: I kind of like this vest.
you know, it's stylish, warm, and, uh, it's bullet-proof.
now!
all right, all right, all right!
it's coming off.
just don't hurt her.
all right, see that?
see that?
okay... Okay, see, now that... that was a sign of trust.
all right?
that's very, very important.
okay, I'm going to be honest with you.
even though you got a gun on me, I'm still your best friend in the whole world.
you think I'm going to fall for that "trust me" cop crap!
he's going to shoot!
I got shot.
you didn't get shot. You didn't get shot.
see, look.
shot at.
hello!" You got shot at.
big difference.
Yeah.
clear!
trust
you always say I don't have to worry about money.
well, you don't.
that's my job.
I found your passwords to your brokerage account.
I made a few trades.
you did what?
Yeah, some index funds, muni bonds.
I made three percent last month.
in a month?
I'm sorry I went behind your back.
in a month?
thank you, Grace.
it can be very frightening to tell our partners something that they don't already know about us.
and you dove right in and you gave us an issue that we could address moving forward.
however, we're going to have to put a pin in that because we're about to run out of time.
and there is one couple we haven't heard from yet.
okay...
so, uh, Travis... This is, uh... this isn't easy for me to say, but...
my weight in grams is...
almost 73, 000...
you don't say.
...exactly. It's true. - Go on. Go on.
I think they're playing you.
...something, something, something.
that's a sh... Oh, look at that.
Oh, look at the time.
who thought an hour could go by so fast?
just one minute.
guys, I can't help thinking that you didn't get a chance to really dig in here today.
no, I think we... got plenty of... And...
since you didn't get to share with each other today,
I think you can do the trust exercise for your homework.
I want you to tell each other something the other doesn't already know about you every day until we next meet.
okay, great session, guys. Thanks.
you got us homework, dumbass.
great. She's gettin' savvy.
they're gonna know something's wrong.
just drive, asshole.
Hey, Danny, right on time as usual, huh?
Hey, you know the drill.
lady of the house wants you to check every drop-off.
actually, we're here on a pickup.
let's go!
all right, three minutes, I want that safe blown and the alarm off.
move, move, move!
copy that.
happy, take the driver.
Yes, sir.
sweet dreams.
front gate, what's going on?
you shouldn't have done that, pal.
all right, let's move.
come on. Let's go. Let's bring this place down.
let's go! Let's go!
I forgot to mention... Okay, so I'm 15.
I'm starting my sophomore year at a brand-new school.
trouble is the school only teaches English as a second language.
what in the hell are you talking about?
our homework.
I'm supposed to tell you something you don't know about me.
Oh, okay.
well, write that down, Travis I'll just read it before the next session.
no, Dr. Ryan always guesses when we do it that way.
you use more details, see?
that's the key to good storytelling.
trust isn't our issue.
it's never been our problem for us.
we trust each other with our lives every time we go out in the field.
check it out: we're not the only ones on site.
S.I.S?
no, look at the shades. G-men all the way. - G-men? No way.
you want to make that interesting?
always. - Okay, usual?
Yep. - Done.
20 bucks.
special Agent Carrie D'Amico. This is my partner, Tom Mills. We're with the FBI.
come on. Oh, I could tell by your glasses.
points for working 'em.
Yeah, Travis Marks, Robbery Homicide.
my sidekick Wes Mitchell.
I'm not a sidekick.
you guys aren't going to be weird about working with us, are you?
sometimes the locals get squirrely when we show up.
locals.
no, ma'am, us locals, we really love helping our friends in the government.
good. - So what's the FBI interested in a home invasion for anyway?
we're with the serial crime division.
the crew that pulled this job also robbed two mansions in Orange County.
we think they hit a house in Vegas last month.
great.
you learn anything so far?
the press in Orange County called them the Baby-Faces.
they've never been caught on camera so these renderings are all we've got.
all right.
so who's up for spanking them?
is he always like this?
most of the time you build up a tolerance.
we'll see. The M. O. is always the same: They invade, lock down a perimeter, then blow some rich guy's safe with plastic explosives.
they work fast and precise and they don't leave anything behind.
what about witnesses?
you guys interviewed most of the, uh, neighbors?
we're the FBI. We interviewed them.
they didn't see anything.
good. So, you talked to the neighbors' kids?
Tom... you went over there.
they didn't mention a kid.
I got up really early this morning.
I wanted to do some drawings before breakfast.
but I heard all this yelling outside.
Mason loves his comic books.
mom, they're called graphic novels.
what exactly did you see?
uh, a couple of them circled on the side of Mr. Tillotson's house.
they looked like they made hand signals to each other, like this...
Ah, those are Army signals.
you served?
uh, no. But I played Purple Heart-- pretty realistic video game.
that game is awesome.
you too?
final Mission.
final Mission is sick.
see, Travis is basically a big teenager.
it comes in handy sometimes.
detective Marks... Can we continue?
excuse me... Did you guys know that they were military?
no, no, we didn't.
but I suppose if we're looking for ex-Army in Southern California, that narrows it down to 20, 000 people.
you were drawing their guns?
uh, yeah.
that should do it.
felt it, right?
felt what?
the FBI lady-- she's giving me vibes.
what?
there were no vibes. - There were vibes.
how is it that you can read a suspect, but not a woman?
it's a subtle thing.
it's an imaginary thing.
special Agent D'Amico is a grownup who's serious about her job.
which means if she was vibing anyone, she'd probably be vibing me.
so, you like her?
no.
no, no. We work together.
listen, man, if you tell me she's in "No-Fly Zone," I'll respect that, bro code...
but, uh, I think we were vibing.
first of all, I'm still not sure about the parameters of this "bro code" still, but she's a "No-Fly Zone" 'cause she's a colleague.
who's a "No-Fly Zone?
no one.
how can we help you, Special Agent D'Amico?
I sent Mills over to Fort Erwin to see if anyone recognizes our rifle.
in the meantime, if you guys are going to tag along, might as well get right into our profiles.
I found it.
I found... I found the gun.
I found it.
it's a, uh... an MP5 assault rifle.
it says here it's used exclusively by, uh, uh...
the Army... Rangers.
all right, I'll have my partner dig up profiles on every Ranger who's been discharged in the last two years.
all right, that sounds like a really good start.
you know what? I'll do you one better.
you get me the names of those Rangers... I'll get you the guy.
how are you gonna do that?
you, me, a hot meal.
pack a bib.
you come over here.
you give your foster mom a big hug.
Hey, hey, been a long time.
it's good to see you.
this is my partner, Wes.
Oh, the uptight one.
you didn't tell me he was so cute!
give me a hug. Give me a hug.
welcome.
you look good. - Oh, come on.
you look good. How you been?
Oh, you know, still looking for work.
but you know, Jason, he helps me get by.
dirt dog? Wow, boy!
what's up, J? What's up, man?
Yeah, nobody really calls me Dirt Dog anymore.
that's only 'cause they don't really know you.
you look good, man How long's it been?
four years?
Yeah, Mom told me you just, you just got discharged like, three months ago.
you know, two tours, man.
I'm still in one piece, though.
that's good. Hey, I'm gonna get some drinks, okay?
okay. What's up, man? I'm Jason.
you're not gonna hug me, are you?
Yeah!
all right. I'm Wes Mitchell.
I'm, uh, Dirty Dog's partner.
he ever tell you what a badass he was before the LAPD gave him a badge?
Oh, anybody want some chicken?
no, no, no, I really want to hear this.
no, man, this cat, this was the best street racer in the whole Valley till a judge ended his career.
what's up, man?
four years. You just stop by to say hi or what?
all is well, man, all is well.
mom told me you got a job counseling vets now.
Yeah, ever since I got back from the Sandbox.
Why?
you want me to snitch on my brother Rangers?
Jason, if the guys pulling these jobs are Rangers, they're not your brothers.
Trav, this is wrong, like, six different ways.
these guys are my clients. They trust me to keep their business to myself.
I get it.
but if any of these guys are violent, if any of them might have even talked to you about committing a crime...
bro, it's great to see you. Seriously.
but I can't help you.
now, granted, I don't speak foster brother, but it seems to me Jason just shot us down cold.
I knew he wouldn't say anything.
but I also knew that if he felt like any one of these guys was involved in something this bad...
he'd find a way to let me know.
he stared right at that picture.
richard LeVelle, demolitions expert.
he tried to re-enlist, they turned him down.
guess LeVelle likes his privacy.
Yeah.
bad place to plan some robberies, huh?
he looks pretty serious about these "Do no enter" signs.
maybe we should wait for a... warrant.
check it out.
summer after my freshman year, my foster parents take me to Louisiana.
and that's where I met Laurie-Anne.
she's technically my foster cousin, but is that really a relative, you know?
I mean, she was Laurie-Anne.
if you insist on doing this, why don't you tell me about the time you got arrested for drag racing.
my lips are sealed... just like the records.
Oh, so you trust me enough to regale me with stories of your conquests, but when it comes to talking about something real, you clam up?
you tell me about your weight in grams.
I know you're not doing it right.
uh, what did I just step on?
what am I standing on right now?
it's been a minute since that bomb-defusing seminar, but, uh...
Oh, boy. Okay, yeah, it looks like you stepped on a pressure plate.
I'm standing on a pressure plate?
looks like a trigger mechanism.
a trigger mechanism?
Ooh... that's a varmar bar mine.
okay, here's the thing: so if you step off, it's gonna blow.
okay, here's what we're gonna do.
I'm gonna stand very still.
you're gonna call Bomb Squad.
you're gonna get 'em down here...
no, no, not an option...
...they're gonna defuse this thing. - Why?
...'cause if you don't step off, it's gonna blow in 90 seconds.
90 sec...?
okay, okay, okay.
we-we need a plan.
Yeah, wait right here.
wait right here.
uh, probably less than 60 seconds now, Travis.
how much do you weigh?
158155
73, 000 grams.
how much?
Oh, damn, okay, here's the thing: one of these buckets is leaking, so we're got to do this fast.
how do you know those are heavy enough to keep down this pressure plate down?
I don't, but they're getting lighter by the second, so... Okay.
wait, wait, wait.
don't you trust me?
do I have a choice?
no. - Okay, wait, wait, wait.
okay, on threezy, okay? - Yeah.
one... two...
threezy.
okay. Go.
Yeah, go! Run!
you think we can go ahead and consider this guy a suspect now?
What?!
exactly.
we're clear!
no more booby traps.
I'm guessing you didn't find Richard LeVelle in there, huh?
no sign of him, unfortunately.
but you guys are definitely gonna want to check out that basement.
okay. - Yeah.
this guy's got enough hardware down here to take over a small country.
Yep. What do we got here?
M15s, RALs, AK-47s, grenades, det cord.
plastic explosives.
blowing safes?
what do you think?
it'd be cool if we found some baby masks down here.
but aside from that, I think we got our guy.
we are cataloging the weapons from inside of his hideout.
we have been hunting the Baby-Faces for two weeks, but up until today we haven't learned much.
but now, thanks to the good work of the LAPD, we finally have a suspect.
this man, Richard LeVelle, had what we estimate to be $200, 000 in illegal weaponry stored in the basement of his house.
our field office will handle transpo dragnet.
you guys work the contacts locally.
the goal is to have LeVelle in custody by end of business tomorrow.
are there any questions?
all right, then.
let's do it to it.
I must admit, Captain, your boys did solid work out there today.
you run a tight ship.
they're the best there are.
especially since they've been going to couples therapy.
come on. - What are you doing?
the don't need to hear about that.
What?! - Couples therapy?
nothing to be embarrassed about.
tell her.
please.
we, uh... you know, it's a long story.
we fight a lot.
now we're in therapy.
Yes.
well, whatever you're doing, keep it up.
What?!
hold it! Hold it!
detective Marks.
special Agent D'Amico.
so, it was your foster brother who tipped us off to LeVelle?
it was indeed.
you must have one hell of an interesting story.
Yeah.
it's, uh, it's absolutely fascinating.
Yeah, it usually takes me about one dinner to get through it all.
dinner?
you and me?
we're working a case, Detective.
I know.
I guess we won't always be working a case.
do not use this until all four of those Babies are in prison.
got it?
Absolutely.
and Detective?
keep this conversation to yourself.
you can trust me.
Oh, I doubt that.
don't make me regret giving you that number.
vibes.
Ryan So Travis, you told Wes about a staggering number of women that you've been with.
and Wes, amongst other fascinating trivia, you told Travis that you lived at 7000 Dallas Avenue from March 17, 1988 until May of 1992.
so how do you both feel?
really good.
great.
completely therapized.
ready to move... move on.
interesting.
it seems to me that what you've done is obey the letter of the law while ignoring the spirit of it, which is becoming something of a specialty with the two of you.
so?
you gave us an assignment.
we did it.
you can't ask us for more than that.
Yes, I can.
this isn't secondary school.
the whole point of this exercise was that the two of you build trust in each other.
you know what?
stand up here and now and face each other.
I want you both to tell the other something that you are scared to say.
want to go ahead? - You go first.
let me help you get started.
Wes, why did you pull a gun on Travis?
that's why you're here, isn't it?
we've never even discussed it.
I don't think I want to get into that.
I had my reasons.
tell Travis what they were.
excuse us.
official police business.
you getting this?
they found LeVelle.
gentlemen, we will talk about this.
Ah, Detectives Mitchell and Marks, the two men you tried to murder today when that bomb exploded.
Mitchell and Marks, we were just explaining to Mr. LeVelle the array of charges that he's facing.
if you'd like to see another day of freedom, I suggest you start cooperating.
who are your associates and where are they now?
my associates?
Yeah, the other Baby-Faces.
you think I'm with those guys on the news?
sorry, not this Ranger.
too bad, that was your only shot at daylight.
look, wait. I'm not with that crew.
but if I can give you something on them, what would it be worth to you?
if it's good information, I can recommend they drop the, uh, attempted murder charge.
you might make parole before you're a senior citizen.
all right, look, I'm a guy that can get things, right?
somebody got in touch with me, said that they needed rifles and C-4.
it was your guys.
what do they look like?
I didn't see them; they were wearing those stupid masks...
what did you see, Richard? Be specific.
I can give you heights and weights, but they were very cautious.
I don't know if this means anything, but the one guy, the one guy they handed all the money, he had his Zippo lighter with him, and he did, like, little... tricks with it.
it was just like that?
you sure?
was it just like that?
Yeah.
Travis, man, we're not grilling tonight.
Oh, that's all right.
a beer will do.
cheers?
Cheers.
you know I can't say anything about the job.
forget about the job.
this is a social call.
you still smoke?
Nah, I gave it up right before I enlisted. You?
Nah, it's been years, but I figure tonight, we're gonna kick around the old times, you know?
catch up.
you, uh... Aw, damn, you got matches?
I got you.
you still got that old Zippo?
hell, yeah.
I mean, I dropped the habit, but I had to hold on to this.
you still do that old trick you used to do every time we used to race?
it calms the nerves.
this bad boy saw two combat tours.
just like you remember it?
Yeah.
here.
Travis, hey, where are you?
I had something to take care of this morning.
okay, well, you could tell me this stuff.
sorry, last minute.
all right, all right, well, just wrap it up.
cause look, we kept banging on LeVelle last night, after you left, which was a very interesting tactic by the way.
anyway, we're on to something.
turns out his customers leave him messages.
this morning, someone sent him a postcard asking for Silly Putty, which is LeVelle's code for C-4.
I know, it's genius, right?
anyway, we're going to this exchange and see if the Baby-Faces are gearing up for another job.
so, kind of a big deal here. When are you getting in?
uh, I don't know.
I don't know. It might be a while. Just cover for me, all right?
Travis, if you make me look bad in front of this federal agent...
Yeah, no, you know what?
you stay there, you follow up on that.
sounds important.
all right, so my partner texted the number on the postcard.
the meet's set up for noon in Griffith Park.
Where's Marks?
Oh, he, um... He heard from a really reliable C. I.last night.
so, he's following up on that.
right now? We're about to break this thing open.
well, it wouldn't be, uh, he wouldn't be working it if it wasn't a really good tip, so...
well, Detective, we've got some time to kill.
are there any open cases you'd like my input on?
very focused, I like that.
but no, I think we're all good here.
are you sure?
cause I've got to do something with the next couple of hours.
and I'm not gonna take your captain up on his invitation to meditate.
Yeah.
well, um, you texted me about that postcard this morning.
I came right in; I didn't get a chance to get any breakfast.
so, we could, uh, you know, do that, if it's something you want to do.
you want to take me to breakfast?
I not... to take you.
just have breakfast.
why don't you just grab something here.
we're working a case together.
I don't think breakfast is a good idea.
Yeah, I'll go in the kitchen, and, uh, I'll fill up on condiments or something.
but, Detective?
we won't always be working on a case.
do not use this until we've got the Baby-Faces in jail.
understood?
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, um, yeah, I got that.
that-that makes sense.
and do me a favor, don't say anything about the card.
we're working a job.
we don't need people gossiping about our private lives.
what's up, bro?
what's up, Jay?
you saw me, huh?
only an hour ago.
so, you show up last night asking me about that old lighter trick; today I see you tailing me.
what's going on?
I got a pretty good idea you're mixed up in something bad, man.
if you are, I can help.
something bad.
you're talking about them home invasions you're looking into, aren't you?
what, you think I'm a criminal?
I'm your brother, man.
I know. That's why I'm here; I need you to stop doing what you're doing.
wow, this is crazy.
we go back.
Where's the trust?
we're talking.
my partner isn't here with me.
that's all the trust you're gonna get.
Yeah, well, you must have got all lost up inside your own head, 'cause I don't know what you're talking about.
I counsel vets.
you buy that bike on a social worker's salary?
save it, man.
I didn't do it.
of course, if I did, you'd be out of luck, wouldn't you?
you couldn't catch me that night we was racing.
I saw you tailing me today.
and I promise you, if I was involved in something heavy, you couldn't catch me.
not true, Jay.
I'll bring you in if I have to.
will you?
please, man.
yeah?
should I call Missing Persons?
where the hell are you?
I told you I had something to take care of.
well, you need to get back here,'cause we went to that exchange in Griffith Park.
picked up a guy named Glen Marsh, ex-Army.
we think he might be one of the Baby-Faces.
Why?
well, we found a Zippo lighter in his car.
we have been at this for hours, Glen, and you still haven't told us anything.
cause it's the truth.
Glen, nobody uses C-4 plastic explosive to go fishing.
that's why we wanted to try it.
I mean, you heard of dynamite fishing, right?
you drop a few sticks down into the lake, set it off, then bam, all the dead fish just rise to the top.
we wanted to see if the same thing worked with C-4.
and did it?
did what?- Did the C-4 kill the fish?
Oh, not yet, but see, that's why we wanted to get some more...
all right, Glen, listen, I'm tired of this.
who are the other Baby-Faces?
dude, I don't know.
man, there's no way I'm the only person in the world with a lighter.
what's up, Captain?
excuse me, uh, I don't think that's one of your guys.
why not?
there's been another robbery.
it was the same basic M.O. as before.
wealthy business guy, lots of cash in the place.
the Baby-Faces took the service elevator up, forced their way in, cleaned the place out.
well, almost.
what do you mean, almost?
Yeah, I guess in the other robberies, the Baby-Faces took every single thing that was in the safe, right?
Yeah.
well, they didn't do that this time.
they left something behind.
I don't know.
maybe they don't smoke?
they didn't leave that behind.
they put it there.
pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up.
you want to tell me what the hell is going on with you?
you've been behaving very un-Travislike lately, ever since Richard LeVelle told us about that lighter.
today, the Baby-Faces leave a Zippo behind for us, you run outside, you make a phone call.
I'm usually pretty good at knowing what's going on in that head of yours, but I got to admit I'm lost here, Travis.
I'm your partner.
we may have our problems, but if this thing is going to work, you cannot hide stuff from me, okay?
all right.
all right.
you want a trust exercise for real?
here's something you don't know about me.
that lighter is a message for me.
it's from Jason.
you think Jason is one of the Baby-Faces.
you've been thinking this for the last day or so, clearly.
while Carrie and I were chasing Glen Marsh around, you were running around trying to find out if that was true.
you... why wouldn't you tell me this, Travis?
I wasn't positive until just now.
all right,'cause I-I-I... I really wanted to believe that Jason was the same kid that I grew up with.
I'm really just... I'm just not in the mood for one of your lectures, okay?
Yeah, I thought you'd be pissed.
I'm not pissed.
I'm disappointed.
you want to hear something about me?
I give you a lot of crap about your foster brothers, but...
truth is I'm jealous.
cause I don't have any brothers.
I don't have anything like that in my life.
I can only imagine what you've been going through here.
did we just make progress?
Yeah, it must be an accident or something, huh?
look, uh... if your head's where it needs to be, I'm good.
is your head where it needs to be? - Yeah.
Yeah.
great. Let's go catch these assholes.
I had a lot of sharp foster moms, but you were hands-down the smartest.
so I know you've done the math.
you're out of work, Mom.
Jason's drawing a government paycheck.
where did all this stuff come from?
how's he bringing you a new TV, a new car?
I don't know.
I mean, he doesn't really want to talk about it, so, you know, I don't ask.
you always knew what we were up to back in the day, no matter what.
so I know you haven't been just watching all this stuff come into the house.
you don't ask 'cause you already know, don't you?
Jason is mixed up in something real bad, and he's going to get hurt if this doesn't end soon.
you're talking about my son.
and my brother. I know.
I know. I-I tried to help him with this.
he just shut me down.
I don't even recognize him, Mom.
it's time for you to help him.
I know.
I know that Jason isn't buying all of this with his investments.
of course I know that.
I've been looking into his computer.
he's been doing research into houses.
the addresses-- they match the ones on the news.
there's been four robberies, right?
Jason looked into five addresses.
remember, routine patrol of the neighborhood.
you just want to check out the grounds. You got it?
okay.
come here. Get on the ground!
don't move.
get down!
unload the C-4. Let's go. Let's go.
okay, stay cool.
defensive protocol.
everybody rendezvous at Mark Delta.
go!
Freeze! LAPD! Drop the weapons now!
drop your weapon, Jason!
I've got him!
that's it! That's it. Don't move. - Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
put it down.
you know, Jason's going to be all right.
I would have pulled that trigger.
I know.
I was there to make sure you didn't have to.
it's his foster brother, isn't it?
the guy who first put us onto Richard LeVelle.
Jason didn't mean to put us onto LeVelle.
he got nervous when he looked at the picture, and Travis just misread it.
but yeah, it's his brother.
you covered for him.
I could have you both arrested if I wanted to.
you're a good partner.
sometimes.
Travis and I did our homework.
no tricks, no games.
you want to talk about it?
well, I think Wes proved that I can trust him, and the rest is between me and him.
okay.
I can respect that.
is there anything else that you want to say to each other?
I find that it's often very helpful just to lay everything out on the table while we're still doing the exercise.
well, actually, uh... kind of got lost in the shuffle last couple of days, but I thought I should say something so things don't get all weird.
I'm going on a date with the FBI agent.
say what?
Yeah, Carrie said after the case was over, she'd go out with me.
she told me that when the case was over, she'd go out with me.
Travis, that's not funny.
no, no, no. - Don't do that.
she gave me her card, told me to keep it to myself.
let me see it.
How...?
she wants to date both of you?
Hey, I'm-I'm sorry, but, uh, that's-that's hot.
hot.
what?
I guess it's possible she's an unusually promiscuous federal agent.
or... I'm assuming she's attractive, right?
she's probably used to her colleagues hitting on her.
maybe, rather than risk souring a relationship and disappointing you both, maybe she strung you both along.
a long con. - Just so long.
Yeah. - It's not actually that complicated.
men are quite easily manipulated, in my experience.
she played both of y'all.
I just... I just feel dirty.
you?
I feel like a rube.
are we idiots? - Nah.
does anyone else want to field that?
no, no comment.
all units, aerial surveillance advises suspects are fleeing west on Temple with a van full of stolen goods.
robbery Homicide unit two responding. We are in pursuit.
copy that. - Let's roll.
we are in pursuit, right?
Yeah, what, this music help get you in the game?
I got you. Here we go; let's go.
bam.
Yeah, let's go. Let's go, baby.
Yeah!
I am in the game.
a good pursuit, Travis, a good pursuit requires some thought.
Oh, a good pursuit requires balls.
requires balls. All right, come on, you got a beat sound system.
you can only get it in this car; let's go.
all you listen to is jazz.
let's go. Come on.
Yeah. Head like that.
jazz promotes concentration and analysis.
if you'd analyze the situation... If you'd analyze the situation, you'd realize that these guys are going west on Temple, which means they're probably headed for the 101, right?
but, of course, the entrance to the 101 is closed for construction. See?
which means we can just wait.
do you ever get tired of being you?
occasionally.
often, actually.
but somebody's got to do it.
LAPD! Put your hands out of the car. Get them out!
let's go!
dad, I am a woman now, and I'm capable of making my own decisions.
and I've decided to marry Owen, and I don't know why you won't accept that.
but you are incapable of making an adult decision.
I mean, Owen?
he's irresponsible.
he's... lazy.
he's a good-time Charlie, and that's fine.
I don't have a problem with that.
he's not husband material.
Dakota and I love each other.
Owen, you don't know what love is.
and furthermore, furthermore...
I can't keep doing this.
can't keep doing this.
we've been doing these weird role-playing exercises for the last three sessions, and by my count, this is the third time someone's asked me to play the cold, withholding father.
meanwhile, Travis here gets cast as the cool, romantic, you know, love interest.
does it bother you that the group sees you as an authority figure?
no, it bothers me that this group has such a problem with authority.
okay, look, I-I just don't... I-I don't know her father.
I've never met him; how am I supposed to portray him? What's the point?
it's a fair question; in a sense, you all have been studying for the last three weeks.
preparing to take on the role of a lifetime.
your partner.
this week, I want you all to try switching places with each other, as it were.
because by becoming them, we can start to understand them better and ourselves.
all right, enough talk.
I'd like you to stand up and switch chairs with your partners.
this is stupid. - Yeah.
he's good.
that's spot on.
what are you talking about?
he's being you.
I know he's being me, but that's not me.
uh, that sure looks like you.
I don't sit like that.
Wes, I invite you to respond as Travis.
I don't care what these good-time Charlie people have to say.
I don't care what any of you all have to say.
this is stupid.
okay, all right, I don't talk like that.
I don't talk to people that way, and I don't sound like that.
like that. - That.
I don't talk like that.
can we take a time-out?
911, what's your emergency?
I've been attacked.
please help me.
he forced his way in.
he kept hitting me.
are you safe now?
is your attacker there?
I don't know.
his name's Kevin Boyd.
ma'am? Ma'am, are you still there?
what are you doing? - Are you still there?
help me! Please help me.
I need your address.
please, ma'am, tell me where you are.
ma'am? Ma'am...!
I think this role-playing exercise is gonna be good for us.
unlikely, since I have no plan of doing it.
that's the beautiful thing; you don't have to do anything.
I'm gonna show you what it's like to work with you.
Oh, you're gonna be professional, disciplined and on point?
I find that highly unlikely.
there you go, you cast yourself in the role of the enforcer of the world's standards.
I think you mean well; you just don't realize you're coming off like a dick.
who put this tape here?
field manual clearly states to establish
see? They resent you.
it's not me.
besides, it's seven yards, guys.
sobering mirror, my friend. Sobering mirror.
congratulations, guys, you just caught the world's easiest clearance.
what makes you say that?
woman named Beth Boyd owns this place.
someone broke in here last night, tied her up and tuned her up, and then they strangled her.
why does that make this the world's easiest clearance?
she managed to place a 911 call before she died.
she gave us the name of her attacker.
a guy named Kevin Boyd, her husband.
we've already got APBs out for him.
things must have really gone bad between these two.
have I thought about visiting harm upon my ex?
Yeah, sure, but... - That'll be all, officer.
and, uh, make sure you pay for that cupcake.
I already did.
but thank you for checking, dick.
Oh, my God.
who is that?
that's the victim's stepsister.
we called her down here to identify the body.
Yes, that's her. That's my sister.
I'm extremely sorry for your loss, ma'am.
but if you're up for it, I need to ask you a couple questions.
Beth made a 911 call before she died.
she said her husband did this to her.
you don't seem very surprised.
I wish I were.
Kevin and Beth are...
were still married, but only because they couldn't settle on the terms of their divorce.
Beth kind of hated Kevin, and he gave it back to her in spades.
and they had to see each other every day.
Why?
he owns the place next door.
Beth and Kevin bought this whole row of storefronts back when things were better, but when-when things went south, they couldn't decide how to split it all up, so they just...
they dug in.
they've been in court for years.
do you know where Kevin might be right now? Our officers can't find him at the address we have on file.
well, if he snapped and hurt Beth, I-I don't know.
maybe he's running.
Hey, Suzanne!
you son of a bitch.
Suzanne, what's going on?
son of a bitch!
Kevin Boyd? - Yeah. What the hell is going on here?
so, you can't remember where you were last night?
I drink sometimes, okay? It's not good, I know.
but the divorce and the shop, it's just so much stress.
come on.
okay. I closed up my store.
I walked two doors down to Northbrook for a whiskey.
and that was, um, 7:30.
I ordered another drink, and that's the last thing I remember.
okay, I woke up in Van Nuys behind the wheel of my car, and that was about 8: 00 this morning.
Kevin, your wife called 911 at 12: 13 a. m. last night.
your alibi leaves a rather large window of time unaccounted for.
Yeah, I know, but I didn't kill Beth, okay?
I'm not an animal. - Yeah?
why'd your wife file a complaint for assault, Kevin.
that was five years ago, okay?
I just... I grabbed her too hard.
it's not right; I was drinking that night.
you were drinking last night.
Kevin, you and your wife were tied up in what, like, five different lawsuits?
there was the divorce; she sued you for failing to maintain the greens outside your store.
so, you sued her for defamation; she came back...
Yeah, we hated each other, okay? I'm not denying it.
Kevin, that's enough.
officers, my client is going through a painful divorce, but that's not evidence that he committed any crime.
Yeah, how's this?
911, what's your emergency?
I've been attacked.
please help me.
he forced his way in. He kept hitting me.
are you safe now?
is your attacker there?
I don't know.
his name is Kevin Boyd.
Oh, my God, I... - Yeah.
Hey, look, I don't know what to tell you.
I mean, that's definitely Beth's voice, but I don't think I'm that kind of man.
look, I'll cooperate however you need, okay?
I'll give you DNA.
you don't have to agree to that.
I want to.
if I... did that.
I deserve whatever I get.
I'll tell you what we'll do, Kevin.
we'll take a sample here, we'll compare it to what we have at the crime scene.
what is that on the back of your hand.
Oh... Looks like a mark from Red Lace.
it's a burlesque club up on La Brea.
I go there sometimes when I drink.
I didn't have this yesterday.
look, maybe Beth was wrong.
maybe, maybe I was at this club last night.
so, this guy doesn't know where he was last night.
and he wants us to run down his alibi for him.
well, I admit, Kevin looks guilty.
but if he was at that strip club last night, he didn't kill Beth.
Wes, please. Red Lace is a burlesque show.
those women are dancers.
thought you had more respect for the arts.
please. Taking your clothes off is not art.
Oh, I see what you did there.
you lay a little trap for me.
when you keep lining them up, I keep slamming them home.
stop, stop, stop, please?!
I have been telling you not to slip your ballet moves into this routine.
look, you want art?
go rent yourself a place over on Franklin.
put on a show there.
sorry, Ed.
I don't know, Ed, it looked pretty good to me.
can we talk?
you don't have to talk to them, Ed.
they amended the city code, these guys are suppose to schedule their spot inspections now.
you can sue them for harassment.
we're not code inspectors.
we're LAPD homicide. You a lawyer?
law student.
is that so surprising?
no. No it isn't so surprising, Ms... Destiny.
ms. Destiny? I know a think or two about the law myself.
here we go.
I speak lawyer.
and isn't it true, that the present code as been reammended?
I'm positive.
the judge that I clerk for, had me pull the papers last week.
and you are just digging yourself in deeper.
I could make a case against you for tortfeasance with intent.
you should know that the punitive damages for that can run the gamut.
if you're going to pretend to be me, you better have the knowledge to back it up.
have you scene this gentleman in your club last night?
uh, oh, yeah, that's Kevin.
he's in here all the time.
Yeah, he was in here last night for a few hours.
I remember because he was throwing down lots of tip money.
usually, he's kind of cheap.
what time did he leave?
I saw him leave, uh, right as the curtain went up on the midnight show.
Beth Boyd placed that 911 call at 12: 13.
Larchmont's about a mile from here give or take.
Kevin could have left the club and been at the store just in time.
Kevin say anything about where he was going?
Ed? - Hm?
withholding information from a homicide investigation is obstruction of justice.
now, you wanna go to jail?
he said he wanted to keep his night going.
he was spending so much money so I referred him over to my friends place.
it's kind of a casino-type operation.
they're kind of loose with the permits over there.
not strictly, um...
...legal.
well, they're open for business.
or they're about to be condemned.
you know, guys in my law firm use to love places like this.
they're shabby on the outside, slick on the inside.
Yeah, just the opposite of the clientele.
all right. Well, BMW's in.
wait, wait, hold on. - What?
it's the music.
I just... The interplay between the bass and the piano.
you get tired of this, yet? - It's exquisite.
you've been doing this for hours now.
wait, wait, wait, okay, here comes the bridge.
all right, enough of this.
you think you're proving some kind of point to me?
do you want to know why I have to pay such attention to the rules, Travis?
it's because I'm partnered with a maniac.
you wanna know what that's like? You wanna know what that's like?
I'll show you.
yeah...
yeah... Evening, sweetheart.
sweetheart? - Sweetheart?
look, uh, my friend and I are feeling lucky tonight.
we heard this was the place to be.
nobody drives through there without a password.
Oh, a password.
the password is, uh,"hot tub.
as in, you, me, bubbles.
go ahead.
Thanks, darlin'.
what are you doing, man?
this is your game, right?
what?
kinda scary not knowing what your partner is going to do next, isn't it?
excuse me!
how you guys doing?
okay, okay, everybody looks very nice today.
LAPD. LAPD. Back up.
LAPD-- Where you going?
where you going?
look, my partner and I just have a few questions to ask you guys.
damn. - And y'all better damn well answer them or...
you go, girl.
...everybody here's gonna wake up in jail tomorrow.
got it?
Yep.
that's right. I just broke a glass for no apparent reason.
boom!
all right, listen up, douche bags.
we need information, and you all are going to give it to us, or each and every one of you is going to take a ride downtown, and I think you know what I mean by "downtown.
you hear me, douche bags?
you said douche bags already.
okay, here's what we want:
we want to know if anyone has seen this guy here last night. Hmm?
uh, I recognize that guy.
we got here at the same time.
and what time, perchance, was that?
uh, I don't know. - Excuse me, sir?
what? - We have cameras on the door.
if you want to take a look, you can see what time he got here.
just, please, don't break anything else.
now, I never forget a face, so I don't want anybody here...
...causing any trouble.
trouble. Half of us are optometrists.
you, zip it.
Thanks, hon. - "Hon"?
easy, cowboy.
you're just jealous because I'm more you than you are.
please.
Hey, look, we got what we came for, right?
Kevin came here at 12: 24 last night.
last 911 call came in at 12: 13.
that leaves Kevin 11 minutes to kill his wife drive here and start gambling.
is that even possible?
if he had a helicopter.
I'll tell you what, Kevin's bail hearing is tomorrow morning.
if I was his defense attorney and I had that kind of timeline to work with,
I could definitely get him out.
if he couldn't have done it, then why did Beth finger him for the call?
maybe the killer had a mask on?
maybe she never saw his face and just assumed it was Kevin.
let me ask you this: besides that phone call does Kevin seem like a killer to you?
he practically cried when we played him the 911 tape, and he volunteered his DNA.
no. Not really.
maybe it's time we started figuring out who else wants Beth dead.
you know what?
this was fun.
I think it was a valuable object lesson for you.
you just like pretending to be me.
I'm the one teaching lessons here, and tomorrow, ugh... school's back in session, baby.
I guess I should commend you on diving into your homework.
thank you.
something tells me that the two of you have managed to turn this into a competition.
that's not commendable?
I think you look sharp, son.
you really make that suit.
Oh, yes. - Yes, you do.
Yeah, you...
last night, I played Travis to a tee, might I add, and I guess this is his way of upping the ante.
you didn't play me.
you played yourself.
he just let out everything that he keeps all bottled up.
it just all came out like a volcano.
you can't... - You know what?
this is actually a good thing.
it is?! - Yes.
I mean, right now, you're just playing caricatures of each other, but if you stick with this, you will end up learning about each other whether you want to or not.
we don't really do the learning.
Yeah, it's kind of an unwritten rule in our thing.
Yeah, well, that's why you're here.
Ah... You cleaned your desk.
I don't get it. This should be making me happy.
you're not capable of happiness, but recognizing its absence is a good start.
we're making progress.
something's wrong with this picture.
what's with the suit?
role play week in therapy, Captain.
role play week.
I remember it. Not bad.
he's just wearing a suit, Cap.
Yeah, but I think he captures the essence of you.
take a look at this.
that new girl down in digital forensics, she stopped by.
she says you asked her to comb through Beth Boyd's hard drive.
now, Beth lodged a couple of harassment complaints against an ex-con, named Carl Battier.
battier already had a couple of aggravated assaults in his file.
after his last stretch, he got a job delivering ingredients to that cupcake store every evening.
so the cupcake lady thought he was harassing her.
well, she was e-mailing back and forth with a lawyer, trying to get a restraining order against this Battier character.
but she dropped it once the delivery company let him go.
Where's he working now?
it's all in there.
sorry, guys. I don't get paid if I don't spin the sign.
so somebody killed the cupcake lady.
that's terrible.
I meant to stop back in there, I mean, after she had a cooling-ff period, - and-and say thanks.- Thanks?
she got you fired.
you're dressed like a hot dog.
Yeah, this gig's the best thing that ever happened to me.
I get to stand out in the sun, breathe the fresh air, meet people.
what's up, man?
can you tell us where you were at midnight on Tuesday?
sir. - "Sir?
it's a term of respect.
is that a problem? I...
no. I usually just don't... get... "sir.
I don't know, you just look... distinguished.
terribly.
all right, look, I was home, I live alone,
I'm a felon on minimum wage, but I didn't kill that lady.
like I said, I was grateful to her.
I get to put on this suit, and the old Carl kind of disappears, and I can become a different guy.
you feel me?
Yes, we feel you. Excuse us.
you know, I actually think he's telling the truth.
Beth Boyd's forensic screen came back in.
she had someone's skin under her fingernails.
the DNA's a match for Kevin.
so he killed Beth and got over to that club in 11 minutes?
I know, I know, it doesn't make any sense to me, either.
but that's what the test says.
Kevin's lawyer got him out on bail this morning.
he could be anywhere.
we gotta get all hands on deck and try and track him down.
Yep.
all units, be on the lookout for Kevin Boyd, last seen in the vicinity of 1277 Larchmont.
Kevin's holed up inside his wife's store?
Yeah. One of the guys saw him sneaking in through the back.
anyone else gone in?
he told us he was going to blow the place if we got any closer.
blow the place?
Yeah. He can't live knowing that he's a murderer.
he gave us 20 minutes to evacuate the area.
Kevin's gonna commit suicide.
I told you people to stay out of here.
Kevin. You don't want to do this.
I absolutely do.
and you don't want to be here for it, so get out!
I killed Beth.
I killed my wife.
Kevin, we don't know that for sure.
I got these scratch marks, and I don't where I got them from, but my lawyer said they found my DNA under Beth's fingernails, so, it kind of adds up, doesn't it?
Yeah. Yeah, it does.
but Kevin, my partner and I-- we don't agree on much.
we argue all the time.
it's kind of our thing.
we put a lot of murderers in jail, and neither one of us is convinced that you did it.
how can you say that?
she named me in the phone call, okay.
my DNA was under her fingernails.
Kevin. The physical evidence is stacked against you, and that's why we got to bring you in.
but think about it.
the time line doesn't make any sense.
you had 11 minutes to get from here to that casino.
on Vine.
nobody could get over there that fast.
seems hard to believe, right?
and I'll tell you what else.
you just don't seem like a killer to us, Kevin.
killers don't offer up their DNA.
killers don't give police 20 minutes to evacuate innocent people.
then how did this happen?
we don't know, but if you didn't do it, your DNA had to get there somehow.
so, you're saying I was set up?
well... it's definitely possible.
think about it.
you blacked out for a long time.
takes more than a few drinks to do that.
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
so... what, I was drugged?
well, we just don't know, Kevin.
give up, let us take you in.
we'll run a tox screen, we'll find out.
but if you don't, you're gonna die here thinking that you murdered your wife?
you don't want that.
pass me the lighter.
all right, all right, let's get you.
let's get out of here.
Oh, shoot. - What?
I was afraid I was gonna chicken out with the lighter, so I set the pilot light to turn on after 20 minutes.
are you okay? - Yeah.
what are you gonna do tomorrow?
what do you mean?
well, I know you don't own more than one suit.
what are you, hung over?
what do you mean?
your hair is a mess, and you're dressed like you just rolled out of bed.
it's a thing we're doing for therapy.
role-play.
when Travis gets here, I'm gonna show him what it's like when the professional partner
I.e.me-- is saddled with a ill-dressed malcontent.
what?
good morning, Jonelle.
so, what do you think?
you'd make a good grownup.
it's too bad it's just a costume.
let me guess. A contest?
only in the sense that Wes is getting his ass kicked.
only one suit, huh?
let me help you guys cut to the chase with all this what-have-you.
you two, as messed up as you both indeed are, need each other.
Wes, you need Travis to be Travis, so you can be you.
you don't need Travis to be more like you, whether you realize it or not.
that's deep.
same thing goes for you, too.
that's just stupid.
honestly, Jonelle, we appreciate it, but we're not here for pop psychology.
we're here for real science.
Really? - Fine.
I don't envy your therapist.
but since I don't get to do a tox screen on a living suspect instead of a dead victim every day, here you go.
somebody gave a whopping dose of flunitrazepam to Kevin Boyd.
it's a roofie.
they gave him the date rape drug?
what's the last place Kevin remembers before he blacked out?
uh, he had a drink at Northbrook, that restaurant just down the street from his store.
all right, thank you.
uh, Travis? - Huh?
yeah? - You, um...
you got a... price tag on your suit.
he got a good deal.
all right, thanks for coming in, Miss Hecht.
I understand you have some questions about what happened to Beth?
Yes. Your restaurant, Northbrook
it's down the block from your sister's cupcake store, correct?
that's right.
Beth and Kevin gave me a deal on the lease back when I was getting started.
well, it seems like your restaurant's the last place Kevin remembers the night that Beth died.
he showed up for drinks at, what was it, 7:00?
was it 7: 00?
mm, around there.
7: 30. - 7: 30?
mm, that's right.
he had, uh... two drinks.
started getting all pissed off at Beth, at me.
then he just left.
couldn't have been any later than ten minutes till.
we ran a tox screen on Kevin.
turns out someone slipped him a roofie that night.
look, um... none of this matters now.
it doesn't change anything that happened.
so I'll just tell you.
I told Beth that Kevin was coming over that night.
she asked me to do her a favor.
she gave me a bottle of whiskey and asked me to make sure that I served him from that bottle.
you did?
I just thought she was gonna play a trick on him, you know?
like, maybe slip him that stuff that makes you sick to your stomach.
Kevin was really hard on her.
if she wanted to play dirty, I wasn't gonna ask any questions.
she was my sister.
why would she dose Kevin?
maybe she just... She wanted him to pass out, I guess, so she could get the DNA and frame him for the assault?
but instead, he... he blacked out.
and he killed her.
so Beth Boyd slipped her husband a Mickey.
none of it adds up to another suspect in her murder.
well, we're not sure.
we know that Beth got her sister to dose Kevin.
does that mean Beth is a suspect?
in her own murder?
well, she didn't necessarily mean to kill herself.
think about it, Cap.
she's tied up in this brutal litigation with her Kevin.
if she stages an attack and gets Kevin convicted of a felony, then she gets everything.
I'm sorry. What-what is that?
my new white noise machine.
waves... birds... chimes...
it gives me clarity of thought.
that's great, Cap.
what Wes was getting at before being Wes got in the way was maybe Beth's death was an accident.
she set up Kevin to be convicted of an assault, and she never said he was trying to kill her on the 911 call.
as she's making the call, she drops the phone and her chair falls over.
she strangles herself.
she trussed herself to the chair?
try proving that one.
well, first we have to see if it's even possible and then we can worry about proving it.
you said you liked role-play, right, Cap?
all right, we got the pile hitch. What's next?
okay, Cap, you got the bowline knot all ready to go?
okay. Here's what you're gonna do.
you're gonna take the end of that rope, throw it over your shoulder, tuck it underneath these ropes around your chest and back in front of you.
hit it.
I gotta say I'm pretty impressed, Cap.
I gotta give credit to my first wife, Cindy.
yeah? She taught you how to tie knots, huh?
Cindy liked to role-play as well.
she loved that hostage/ freedom fighter scenario.
what do you want? It was the '70s.
I can't do it. It can't be done.
okay, all right, Cap, relax.
let me see that. All right.
all right, underneath... that goes under here, back up through the bowline.
through... There's just no way Beth tied herself to that chair.
wait.
look at the knots.
they're backwards.
cap tied himself to this chair, and he's right-handed.
whoever tied Beth to the chair's a lefty.
Kevin Boyd is right-handed.
so there was someone else in that bakery with Beth.
it wasn't Kevin Boyd.
911. What's your emergency?
I've been attacked. Please help me!
he forced his way in... - 911. What's your emergency?
I have been through everything, and there is absolutely no forensic evidence that anyone other than Beth or Kevin was in that room.
is your attacker there?
why do you keep listening to it, Travis?
we've heard it a dozen times.
I don't know.
you know? I'm playing you, right?
I'm playing you. - Isn't that what you do?
just keep reviewing the evidence over and over again until you're certain that this innocent person isn't going away?
you know, that almost sounded like a compliment.
you're lucky I'm in a bad mood. Otherwise it never would have happened.
no, no, no, wait, wait.
play it again.
Why? You just said we've listened to it a dozen times.
Yeah, I know I said that but we know more now.
we know someone else was in that room.
listen to Beth's voice on this.
911, what's your emergency?
I've been attacked.
see, she's talking to that 911 operator right now.
everything's going according to plan.
is your attacker there?
right... there, she falls.
ma'am, are you still there?
what are you doing?
now she doesn't have that phone anymore.
and it doesn't sound like she's talking to that 911 operator anymore.
sounds like she's talking to whoever else is in that room.
Beth didn't expect to start choking.
so she's begging for help.
listen to it again.
okay everybody shut up for a minute.
is your attacker there?
there is a pause between the first and second time she says "help me.
ma'am, are you still there?
what are you doing?
I need your address.
please, ma'am, tell me where you are.
there. The killer said something to her.
Yeah, let's get the recording down to digital forensics.
see if they can drop the operator's voice out and boost up the background noise.
what are you doing?
I need your address.
please, ma'am, tell me where you are.
I'm sorry.
please help me.
I'll be damned.
a woman killed Beth Boyd.
Ivy, make sure you tell your customers we've 86'd the goat cheese salad, okay?
Thanks.
guys, you really should have called first.
this is not a good time.
that's okay.
we brought Beth's personal effects.
we thought you might like to have them back.
thank you. - Yeah.
Oh, you know what? She has to sign for them.
Oh, yeah. Sorry. Sorry.
sign right there.
okay. Left-handed?
E-excuse me.
statue of Liberty?
no. I'm you today. I get to do the takedown.
stop you're under arrest!
Hi, there.
you're under arrest.
you hit her with the cart.
technically, you hit her with the cart.
see, we're role-playing.
it's a long story.
you okay?
you good enough to roll over?
these suits are uncomfortable, man.
Yeah, welcome to my world. - Oh, man.
so Suzanne collaborated with Beth to frame me?
Yeah.
you took the roofie, and passed out long enough for Beth to get your skin under her fingernails.
as far as Beth knew, it was just supposed to be an assault.
you know, you go to jail, she'd get everything.
but Suzanne's restaurant was bleeding money.
so she figured with Beth out of the picture, she'd own the property...
and all her troubles would be over.
sorry, Kevin.
look, I know you guys were having your problems but Beth was your wife.
how do we get so far away from who we used to be?
I have to make some changes.
big ones. Thank you.
seriously.
you guys believed in me even when I was ready to write myself off.
good luck, Kevin.
Oh, man. I'm so tired of this thing.
it's not easy being me, is it?
I already cracked the case by being you.
you didn't crack the case being me.
I was the one listening to that tape?
I was the better... I was the one that discovered the pause in the tape.
you wouldn't have heard the pause...
that's something... - ...if I wasn't listening to the tape.
all you could figure out was that I did the pen thing.
listen, man, I can see through that shirt. - That's pathetic.
and I look better in this shirt than you do.
so I take it you're done with the role-playing?- Yeah.
it's an interesting experiment.
but it ran its course. - Yeah.
do you think that either of you learned anything from it?
what? No. - Absolutely not.
okay. Does anyone else want to share their experience?
wait. - Yes, Travis?
Yes, Travis, is there something you'd like to share with the group?
there was that thing that Jonelle said.
Oh, come on, not that.
okay, she said that I need Wes to be Wes so I can be me.
and vice versa.
and makes a lot of sense if you really think about it.
why is that?
well, uh... I'm the kind of guy who flies by the seat of his pants.
I take things as they come.
and there are times, there are moments when it's probably a good thing that Wes is around to help get things squared away.
that's true.
all right, all right, I'll concede that I can get a little lost in my head sometimes and Travis helps to push things along.
and, um, in some cases I may overanalyze if Travis weren't around.
that is so cute.
you guys need each other.
I didn't say we needed... - That's not what he said, woman.
I mean... - I said, I over analyzing...
congratulations, guys.
you really applied yourselves to this.
this is your first real breakthrough.
how does it feel?
feeling like you tricked us.
Absolutely. 100% trickery.
I worked hard all my life. All I wanted was a room where I could do what I wanted to do, and now my 25-year-old is doing what he wants to do in my happy room.
Wes, I'm sensing you have an opinion on this.
no. - He's lying. He has an opinion.
he always has an opinion.
I can't tell the Dumonts how to raise their kid.
but you're going to.
you cannot let your son live in your house without some sense of responsibility here.
otherwise he's just gonna think that he can skate through life because someone's always there with a stapler when he needs one.
you're still thinking about that?
I used that to make a point.
what happened with the stapler?
what happened to your stapler?
I don't know; someone must have borrowed it.
no, you lost it.
third one this week.
so, are you gonna let me borrow your stapler or not?
no, too risky.
you go through staplers almost as fast as you go through women.
can I borrow your stapler, please? - Yeah, sure.
you're fighting over a stapler?
the stapler represents something important in Wes's life?
his ex-wife.
that's good, that's good. - Peter...
I think you're on to something.
he's controlling because he's lost control of his own life.
okay, how did we get here?
because this session just took a detour to, uh, to crazy town.
but I'm curious, did Peter and Dakota maybe touch a nerve?
I mean, you're responsible, you're reliable.
I think it's central to your perception of who you are.
where as Travis, meanwhile, you feel, has created a life that's largely free of responsibility, and he doesn't seem to suffer for it.
because I suffer for it.
so, it's fair to say that it does upset you.
I-I just want Travis to take care of his stapler.
what's up, baby?
I've got a visual on Garza.
assume he's packing.
is everyone in position?
gonzalez covering the west side.
Parker to the east.
officer Fletcher covering the backside of the park.
wait a minute. Who's this guy?
he just shot Garza.
Garza's down. - Subject is down. Subject is down.
roll medical units.
LAPD! Stop!
officer Fletcher's down; we need assistance immediately.
officer down.
we're at the 2300 block of Flores.
captain?
is Randi okay?
Yeah, she just got out of surgery.
she's got a pretty bad shoulder wound, but the doctors say she'll probably make a full recovery.
miss Fletcher's awake.
Hey, slick.
how you doing, hm?
should I tell the dispatcher you're about to come back for the afternoon shift?
well, I don't know. I am having a pretty good time with this morphine drip.
I bet you are.
you two caught my case?
we got you.
you up for talking about what happened?
Yeah, um, shooter was maybe five-eight, left-handed, uh, Hudson chased him.
I think maybe he got a piece of the guy's pants, but he definitely got the shooter's scent.
you're saying your dog's a witness?
well, I'm saying that if you get close to the guy who pulled the trigger, Hudson will tell you.
what are supposed to do? Round up all the usual suspects and do a sniff lineup?
well, I was actually hoping that Hudson could partner with you guys.
Hey, Hudson already likes you, Travis.
you know, from when we were...
you two dated? And you didn't tell me?
there's paperwork for this, people, huh?
I'd be happy to take care of that, sir.
happy.
you sure you can handle that?
Yes, I can.
lot of responsibility. - I know this.
it's a precision-trained animal.
she wouldn't ask me if she didn't think I could; right, Randi?
okay.
we got a cop in the hospital and a body in the morgue.
Mitchell and Marks are running the operation.
want you to give them all the help you possibly can. Any questions?
officer.
captain, everyone in this room wants the prick who shot Randi off the street.
you really gonna hand this off to the guys you're sending to couple's therapy?
you know, as it turns out... - Captain.
it's Hawkes, right?
I'll tell you what, Hawkes, you... make it to robbery-homicide, you knock us off the top spot, you feel free to answer that question.
can we just stay focused?
narcotics ran the op when Randi got shot.
what else can you tell us?
forensics took a quick look at the shell casings.
they said it came from a 357, a Desert Eagle model.
we were there to arrest a guy named Luis Garza;
he's with Los Ladrones, and he deals out of the park where he got shot.
okay, any idea who'd want this Garza dead?
well, Los Ladrones buys their product wholesale from an outfit called the Lone Wolves.
those white power dudes out in Riverside.
that's right; lately, they've been beefing over price, so we think maybe the Wolves popped Garza to send a message.
I don't think it's a business thing.
what makes you say that?
Garza and a guy from the Rolling Fives named Rennell Barrett got into it over some girl.
Garza shot Barrett in the leg.
Barrett refused to testify; said he wanted to take care of the problem himself.
he's a real romantic. Where can we find this Barrett?
your guess is as good as mine.
he's got a warrant out on him for a liquor store robbery Nobody's seen him in weeks.
so, let's put an APB out on him. Get this cop-shooter's face out...
potential cop-shooter.
whatever, we need to get his... - Kind of an important distinction.
I'm not testifying in court. - Well, you're addressing a room full of detectives, you should use the proper vernacular.
if you understood what I was saying. Listen.
I'm using the proper...
sorry, sir.- You don't even...
you kidding?
so, let's get Rennell Barrett's face to the press, flush him out from whatever rock he's hiding under.
meantime, we'll check out these Lone Wolves, okay?
looks like that therapy thing's really taking, Cap.
great call.
Hey, hold it, listen. Hold on, before you go.
remember this is Randi we're talking about, huh?
and I want you to send every positive thought in these guys' direction.
now, let's lock it up, huh?
up, up, ladies.
put your hands together here.
repeat after me.
I am a positive ion in the universe.
I am a positive ion in the universe.
okay.
okay. - I feel good about this.
yeah?
and Hudson should have "a breakfast of carrots and yogurt by 6: 00 a.m.
organic carrots, please.
I don't want him to get stomach cancer.
he also needs a trip to the dog park at lunch and after work.
not the dog park in Silverlake.
everyone knows shepherds don't get along with Great Danes.
I didn't know that.
everybody knows that."Did you know that?
why do you always set yourself up for failure, Travis?
I'll be fine; I like dogs.
no, you like the idea of dogs.
you like the idea of something cute and cuddly licking your face, giving you unconditional affection.
you're not gonna like actually having a dog.
I can handle it.
yeah? Like your stapler?
Hey, boy.
Hey, boy, come here.
there you go, there you go.
come here. Sit.
Oh, good boy. Good boy.
he wants you to pet him.
I know what it wants.
I know you hate people, but dogs, really?
I don't hate dogs.
okay, I'm realistic about dogs.
I know if you died in your sleep tonight, that animal would eat your face off.
so, think about that while you're scratching behind its ears.
you're a deeply damaged man.
stay, Hudson.
lone Wolves Shooting Club.
should be a hoot.
having a dog's not so hard.
you've had him for an hour, Travis.
Yeah, but I'm good at it.
look, Travis, maybe you should wait out here.
Oh, okay, what are you gonna do?
go in there and flash your badge and ask if anyone has a silver Desert Eagle?
of course not.
okay, just watch and learn.
okay, what's your idea?
smile for the camera.
you look Aryan; they should let you right in.
I don't look Aryan.
shut up.
Hey, how you doing?
how you doing?
Hey, listen, is this where I apply to join your fine organization?
no, this is where you apply to get your ass kicked.
that's funny. That's funny, yeah.
listen man, I love guns.
I love guns.
and I love the guys who like to shoot the guns.
you need to get your friend out of here, buddy.
no, no, he's not my friend; I can't stand him.
look, you might want to try another club.
there's a place south of here you might be a little more comfortable in.
is that right?
Yeah, it's called Africa.
I don't get it; Africa isn't south of here.
no, no, it goes Mexico, Central America, South America... - Antarctica.
Absolutely.
but no Africa.
look, you both need to leave here right now.
okay, easy.
I don't understand.
I mean, this is a gun club, right?
Yeah.
it's a gun club.
hm, well, I brought a gun.
why can't I join?
excuse me?
can't help but notice you're left-handed.
what? Wouldn't happen to be a Desert Eagle.357, would it?
is that a Desert Eagle.357? Huh?
don't move. LAPD. LAPD.
Hey, man.
I really don't want to join your club anymore.
Garza's dead?
good. He had it coming.
but I didn't do it.
Yeah, well, the killer had a Silver Desert Eagle, and was left-handed, just like you.
you said he was killed yesterday at noon?
I have an alibi.
I was in a bar.
at lunch?
it's a certain kind of bar.
attracts a certain kind of crowd.
couldn't be any worse than the crowd you're hanging with now.
it's... called Ramses.
it's, uh, in West Hollywood.
Ramses. No.
Yeah, you know, like the Egyptian pharaoh.
it's a... a... - A gay bar?
that's quite a secret you're keeping.
Yeah, I know... but I didn't kill Garza.
I couldn't have.
at least 20 other guys saw me singing karaoke.
go ask 'em.
we don't need to. We have a witness.
go do you thing. No. Go sniff him.
Hudson, do-do your thing.
he's not doing anything.
let me get this straight.
you hate pretty much everybody, but you love the company of men.
I don't know. It's, uh... it's complicated.
my attitudes are... evolving.
Ramses in West Hollywood.
Yes, it's the gay bar.
like right now, you're black, but you have the most amazing green eyes. So...
I don't really know what I'm feeling.
Oh, God, I'm a mess.
my eyes are blue.
they are.
he's not lying.
he was at Ramses all afternoon.
apparently, he gave a very stirring rendition of "When Doves Cry.
still nothing on that APB on Rennell Barrett.
we should be exploring other options.
Barrett's our only suspect.
well, Garza gets popped right before Randi arrests him.
maybe someone in his own gang was afraid he was going to turn.
watch it! - Sorry about that!
Yeah, this is professional.
listen, Randi's list said Hudson needs to play for half hour after every meal.
I'm trying to be responsible here.
think it's great you're being responsible, Travis.
you got to take it to a dog park.
I don't have time. I've got a friend coming into town.
I need to make sure that Hudson is nice and worn out.
a friend - You know her, actually.
do you remember when we went to that bomb-defusing seminar in Vegas, like, three months back?
I got close to the lady who taught it.
so, in point of fact, you're not being responsible at all.
you're trying to tire out the dog so it doesn't bother you while you're having sex all night.
what's the difference?
Hudson needs a workout either way.
subjectively, I think there's a huge difference.
no, there isn't.
and by the way, Hudson is a "he," not an "it.
life gets complicated when you have responsibilities, doesn't it?
life gets complicated when you're partnered with an...
Hey, now. Watch your mouth. Don't swear in front of the dog.
Randi wouldn't approve.
uh... You didn't tell me you had a dog.
he's, uh... he's... - Oh, God.
Hudson. Hudson... Hey, easy.
absolutely not.
what?
Hey, you got to get over here, man.
Hudson's freaking out on Kelly.
why does that mean I have to get over there?
listen, Hudson's used to seeing me with Randi.
another woman, all right?
I don't know. It's a problem.
some sort of dog psychology crap. Know what I mean?
but, uh, you got to take him tonight, all right?
sorry. It's just a signal issue.
Yeah. Okay.
Travis, I can't bring a dog over here. It's a hotel.
wait, wait, wait.
he's a service animal, all right? Come on, man. Bro code.
did you say, "Bro code?
bro code.
what is this, college?
you got to get over here, all right?
the protocols are clear.
you have to help...
just a bad signal in here, you know.
okay.
I'll do it on one condition.
good. Anything. Go.
tomorrow in therapy, you have to admit that I was right.
Seriously?
uh, I'm talking now.
you have to say that this phone call was inevitable, and you have to admit that you lost...
five staplers.
here you go.
told you this would happen.
all right.
all right, these are special circumstances.
your whole life is a special circumstance.
there you go, buddy. All right.
whoa, whoa, hold up.
forgot Mr. Slushie.
mister what?
here you go. All right? He's a great dog.
here are the instructions.
have fun.
Nope.
no, no. No, no.
off.
no. No, no, no. No, no, no, no. No, no.
that's... No.
no. Hudson. No. No, no, no.
Hudson? Hudson? Hudson, no! Hudson!
okay, um, I have an announcement to make.
I entered into an agreement to, uh, take care of my friend Randi's dog, and, um, last night, due to circumstances beyond my control...
okay,'cause of a houseguest, um...
I was unable to fulfill my responsibilities.
Wes, of course, was without female companionship, so, he was able to step right in and help out, and, uh...
you know, I'm-I'm grate... ful.
and I should have kept track of my stapler, although, - I can't imagine why anyone... - Okay, I'm gonna step in here, guys.
God bless you.
Wes and Travis, I see that there's some difficulty expressing express gratitude in front of the whole group?
it felt like, uh, you know, getting a root canal.
can you say any more about that?
well, Wes just seems to just want to gloat about how irresponsible I am, and that's not even true.
how can you say that?
you promised you'd take care of the dog, and you didn't do it.
it's not that I couldn't do it.
I chose not to do it, and I'll be fine from here on out.
Oh, I'm sorry. You're not getting Hudson back.
Yes, I am. - No, you're not.
that's a precision trained animal.
it needs discipline and attention.
you hate dogs.
I'm not a fan of dogs in general.
that's true.
now, this specific dog...
...is, uh... is okay.
that is so cute.
you like him.
no, you can't take Hudson away from me just because I had a hot date last night.
can you think about someone else besides yourself for two seconds?
think about what's best for the dog.
okay, I'm going to jump in here again, guys, because this is actually an opportunity for the two of you to work together towards a compromise.
I mean, Wes, you've already been taking care of Hudson at night, so why don't you continue to do that?
and Travis, how about you take responsibility for him during the day?
joint custody. It's what we have to do with the kids after my first wife.
sit. - So Garza is a member of Los Ladrones.
they deal heroin, they deal drugs. They're a big money business.
he's a local player, he's not a big kingpin.
for someone in his own gang to flip on... What are you doing?
you cannot feed him those things, Travis. - It's daytime.
I'm taking care of Hudson now. He likes cheese.
there is no cheese in those things.
um, excuse me.
day time.
I'm taking care of Hudson now, and he likey cheese.
look at the ingredients.
Wes, he can't read the label, all right?
he just knows what tastes good.
Hudson can't read it, you can.
sit.
this dog works hard.
he should be allowed to have a good time.
so you get to be the fun one, and I provide all the discipline?
Hey, good news, boys.
Hey, how's the puppy? Hmm?
how's the puppy?
last night I go home, and I picture a major break in the case.
I recite my affirmations, and I go to sleep.
I wake up, and lo and behold.
my mind has influenced the world around me.
are you talking about catching the guy who shot Randi?
Yeah, indeed I am.
Hey, I got a great hit on the tip line this morning.
cap. the tip line? That's a dumping ground for prank callers and whack jobs.
you know, it that's the kind of negative talk that has this big no cloud all around you.
I've been trying to tell him that for years, Cap.
what did you get?
this particular citizen, anonymous as he is, claims to know where Rennell Barrett is hiding.
I got an address.
positive affirmations, gentlemen, huh?
visualizing cracking this case wide open.
it works all the time.
that's 116 Edgerton.
looks abandoned.
what do you think?
Yeah, abandoned with, uh, fresh garbage.
stay Hudson.
silver Desert Eagle.
I'll go up.
I'll cover the weak side.
LAPD! Come on out with your hands up.
Rennell, get your buns out here right now!
just bought this... suit!
Barrett, stop!
LAPD! Stop now!
get him!
come on, man!
you're under arrest.
and if you don't mind my saying so, you picked a less than ideal spot to hide your gun.
gun? What gun?
the 357 you used to shoot Luis Garza.
man, I didn't shoot anybody, man!
y'all got the wrong person, man.
Damn! - We got him.
Rennell Barrett... meet Hudson.
yo, man, I don't know what this is about, but you better not let that dog nowhere near me or I'm gonna sue you all.
Yeah, he's just gonna take a sniff.
he's not sniffing me.
man, I'm not saying nothing, and I'm not taking no sniff test.
lawyer now!
Travis. Travis, can't do it.
can't let Hudson sniff him.
you serious?
let the dog sniff him now he asked for an attorney, it's illegal search.
Yeah, this is Detective Mitchell.
I need patrol, 116 Edgerton, pick up perp, potential murder weapon.
so, let me just make sure I understand you correctly.
in addition to my client's alleged participation in a liquor store robbery, you also suspect he's involved in a murder and a shooting of a police officer.
and if my client is willing to submit to an olfactory inspection by a drug-sniffing dog, you'll agree to a plea bargain on the robbery charge.
I'm willing to pass that recommendation on to the D.A.
Yes.
do you realize the dog can't testify in court, right?
he can't.
but my partner and I can testify as to the dog's behavior here today.
my client agrees to those terms.
could you stand up, please?
dude, that thing better not bite me or I'm gonna own this place.
relax. All he has to do is point.
okay, here we go.
do your thing, Hudson.
is it all right if I pet him?
cause I think he likes me.
Yes, who just exonerated my client?
so, the preliminary ballistics tests are back, and they indicate that this weapon is a match for the gun that killed Luis Garza and wounded a cop.
and you would like for me to hold off on pressing charges against Rennell Barrett?
we're not sure Barrett is the shooter.
according to... your dog.
look, we don't know how that gun got outside Barrett's safe house.
we find Barrett through an anonymous tip, that gun happens to be waiting in a garbage bag outside his house?
that doesn't feel like a setup to you?
I think you're getting a little hung up on the importance of Hudson the Amazing Canine Detective.
uh... His opinion has no bearing on this case.
guys... you should take the win.
go get a couple of beers.
your city thanks you.
Bob, I'm so sorry; I'm trying to keep it down.
you said that the last two times I came up here.
look, someone is obviously smoking marijuana on this floor.
I smelled it myself a while ago.
imagine what it's doing to this dog.
I appreciate the animal's distress, sir, but we've had multiple complaints.
guests are threatening to leave.
you're going to have to make alternate arrangements.
it's my partner.
this better be good.
Hudson! Stop it!
Travis, I'm bringing Hudson over.
no, you can't bring him here.
Travis, someone's getting high over here-- he's going nuts.
I have to.
you can't bring him here. You can't bring him here.
Kelly stayed an extra night.
I thought she was going home.
Travis, you said you were gonna be more responsible.
Hudson, put it down!
Yeah, you said you wanted joint custody.
Travis, it's 10: 30 at night.
where am I supposed to take this thing?
uh, oh, so he's a "thing" now, huh?
I told you... Hey, look... look, you're a responsible guy.
I'm sure you're gonna figure something else out.
Travis, don't...
I am so sorry about this.
I used to beg you to get a dog.
you and I were both too busy being lawyers to have a dog, and this is not my dog.
I told you, this is a work thing.
well, he seems sweet.
Yeah, he's all right.
Oh, hello.
his name is Hudson. - Hi there, Hudson.
so, I made up the couch for you.
Yeah, thank you.
I-I really do appreciate this. Thank you.
okay. Good night... Wes.
good night, Alex.
Hudson. I told you there is... no room here.
off.
I guess he's still getting used to being here.
I'm so sorry.
I don't know, I think he's used to sleeping with people or something.
I don't know how to get him to go to bed.
well, we could try that trick we used the night we were babysitting for Annabelle.
what trick?
smooth jazz deejays.
Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay, puppy.
we are gonna talk to you like we both... just popped the muscle relaxants.
we're very calm now, Mm-hmm.
just like those deejays at Fog's Smooth Jazz, the very bottom of your FM dial.
coming up next, it's... the great Kenny G...
with "Mellow Elevator.
going down?
you got to listen to that sax.
all right.
I think he's calming down.
I can take it from here.
you can go to bed.
good night.
thanks for nothing.
life gets complicated when you have responsibilities, right?
Oh, yeah?
listen, if someone set Rennell Barrett up, it was probably whoever called in the anonymous tip.
so I pulled the phone records from the tip hotline this morning.
the guy who fingered Barrett called from a pay phone.
so the pay phone is in front of a gas station in Glassell Park.
so I called over and talked to the manager, and he told me he's got a security camera mounted over the front door.
with a view of the pay phone?
partial. Partial.
but... tip came in around, oh, about 11: 10, so I was just pulling up the footage when you got here.
that's 11: 15.
all right, pull up the one from the front.
damn.
no, wait, hold that. Stop that.
look at the Crown Vic.
Why? You can't even see the plate.
Yeah, look at the hood.
see how it's scooped?
they do that to accommodate turbos, big block engines.
we use that modification on our unmarked cars.
Yeah, but they sell souped-up Crown Vics to civilians, too.
Yeah.
Hey, Marks.
you're watching Randi's dog, right?
Yeah. - We both are.
Hey, you guys better get in here.
what the hell?
excuse me.
Hey, did... did he drink that?
Hey, Hud? - Hud?
I mean... I'm sorry.
okay. - I can't.
What'd she say?
same thing she's been saying for an hour.
they'll tell us something when they know something.
you know this is your fault.
me?
we were both there.
Oh, no, no, no.
Hudson is yours during the day.
this happened on your watch.
I'll tell you something else-- if this goes, you know, bad, you're telling Randi.
is that what you're thinking about?
no, that's not all I'm thinking about right now.
obviously, I'm worried about the dog, and yelling at you is making me feel better!
excuse me, gentlemen?
is Hudson all right?
well, we're not sure.
we pumped his stomach and gave him activated charcoal.
y-you told us that you thought Hudson swallowed some kind of solvent, but we didn't find anything like that in his system.
Hudson swallowed three strychnine tablets.
someone fed him strychnine?
I'm really sorry, but it looks like somebody tried to kill your dog.
I think I know who did this.
so do I.
somebody poisoned Hudson.
at the station.
and the anonymous caller drives a big Crown Vic.
big block engine.
cop did it. - Cop did it.
captain Sutton's gonna need proof before we start pointing fingers on this.
guys.
there's someone who wants to see you.
Hey, Hudson. How ya doing?
he's going to be nauseous for a couple of days, but he'll be fine.
you can take him home whenever you're ready.
Thanks. Doc
Yeah.
you all right, Hudson? You gave us a scare there.
we thought you were dead.
what?
captain's gonna want more evidence that the shooter's a cop.
I think I know a way.
it's always a dark day when... we lose a fellow officer.
many of you knew and loved Hudson.
he was a dedicated member of the canine narcotics squad.
tragically, Hudson lost his life today when he accidentally ingested some cleaning solvents that were carelessly left open in our own kitchen.
this kind of terrible accident reminds me of exactly how fragile life is.
so how much time you think we have?
Sutton loves a captive audience.
we're gonna be good for a few minutes.
call me naive, but... I for one do believe that all dogs go to heaven.
and at this very moment,
Hudson is standing at the foot of the rainbow bridge keeping paradise free of contraband.
Where's it at, Hud?
where? - Where's that at?
Where's it at? - Where?
now if you would please, uh, join me in a moment of silence for our fallen brother.
it was Jim Hawkes.
he's tied in with Garza.
but when Hawkes found out that Garza was about to go down on a murder charge, he figured he had to act before Garza played the one card he had.
the name of the dirty cop.
exactly.
but by the time he gets over there to pop Garza... the arrest is about to go down.
he's surrounded by cops.
shoots Randi.
then he sets up that guy Barrett.
points me and Wes in his direction.
listen, Hawkes thinks that he killed the only witness.
with Hudson out of the picture, he's back in business.
we got a GPS run down on Hawkes Crown Vic.
turns out he goes to the docks every Friday at six a. m.
all right. Let's see what he's up to.
heck yeah.
all right, Hawkes.
what are you doing at the docks at six a. m.every Friday?
betting it's something illegal.
would you stop it?
my bad.
Hey, I'm totally a dirty cop.
are those my drugs?" - "Yeah.
where do you want us to put them?" "Trunk's good.
please stop that.
surveillance, you getting this?
every heartwarming second.
all right, get ready to roll.
let's go.
Hey, that's me. That's me.
LAPD. Drop your weapons.
get your hands in the air. Get on the ground now.
cover two, cover two.
Hawkes. Don't.
gun.
No!
that was for Randi.
all right, Hudson, we got him, we got him.
what the hell?
I thought Sutton said that dog was dead?
don't you know dogs can play dead?
everyone knows that, dumbass.
that's why you going to prison.
how's your hand?
it's all right.
you'll live? - Shut up.
what's up?
I just got off work.
you left Mr. Slushie at my house... last night.
Thanks.
weird question.
did you ever think about getting a dog for yourself?
get a dog? Uh, not really. No.
it might be good for you.
get you out in the world.
force you to, um, get your own place.
Yeah.
you know why dogs are good?
they get people out of their own heads.
see ya.
well, hey.
what are you doing here?
not that I owe you an explanation or anything, but I heard Randi was coming in today to say hi to everybody so I...
...came here.
Yeah.
I, you know, I... Listen, it's possible that I could've done a...
slightly better job of taking care of Hudson.
you know, it's 2: 30, I figured he's due for some exercise.
so I'll, uh, just gonna walk him.
what are you doing here?
Slushie.
he kind of can't sleep without him.
Yeah, right? Yeah, he loves his doll.
Hey, guys.
look who it is, boy.
so, uh, congrats are in order I hear.
you're gonna get a commendation.
Yeah. - Yeah. Congratulations.
you deserve it. - Thank you.
I brought, uh, someone there Mr. Slushie back.
thank you. I've been looking everywhere for that.
Hey, so I know Hudson needs his exercise at lunchtime.
I'm here.
you guys want to take him out to play?
no, well-- We?
we didn't come together... No.
we didn't... ...to play with the dog together.
well, that is very cute.
here you go. Go ahead.
okay, so... We'll just, we'll just do it together.
you want to walk him to the park and I'll walk him back?
as long as I get first throw.
don't let him walk in front of you 'cause you have to establish yourself as the alpha with the dog...
do me a favor?
Oh, yeah, do me a favor?
shut up because, you know, this is my half of the walk.
and on your half, you can be the alpha.
well, I just don't want you to ruin the dog.
it's a finely trained animal.
you ruin... - How am I gonna ruin the dog?
the way you ruin everything.
Ah, we're early. - Good.
could've slept an extra 20 minutes, man.
well, now we have plenty of time to eat our breakfast.
what do you want, you want the onion or do you want the everything?
I know what you want, you want that everything. There you go. Eat that up.
okay.
uh, there's no cream cheese.
well, they must have forgotten it.
and you forgot to check because you were in such a rush to get here so we could be early, right?
well, being early is not going to kill you, Travis.
you know what I'm going to do? Take a nap.
wait for everyone else to get here.
you know, being early is better than being late.
I don't want to be late.
I want to be on time.
if you don't leave yourself a cushion and something goes wrong, then you are late.
Wes, something going wrong is a perfectly valid excuse to be late.
good morning! I love it when my clients are eager to get started.
Ah, yes.
well, as far as I'm concerned, if you're not early, you're late.
uh, maybe two to three times a week.
per week?!
Oh, to be young.
just tell us, have you two had sex yet today?
I respect everyone here, but this conversation doesn't apply to us.
we don't live together.
we have romantic relationships outside of this room.
we're not a couple.
all right.
not in the traditional sense, but you're a partnership.
and you're having partnership issues, which is why you're here.
look, you can play whatever word games you want here.
we're not a real couple.
I mean, we don't have...
no. No. - Yeah.
listen to this:
Cooper was unique in major bank robbers in that he successfully pulled off his theft alone.
well, the robbery was successful.
the escape left something to be desired.
Cooper here's a genuine star.
all the inmates loved him.
sounds like you want an autograph, Opie.
your ass is still mine, convict.
whatever you say, Red
you really think the money's hidden all the way out here?
my bet is this is all just an excuse to get a little fresh air.
no money, no deal.
it's a lot of money. People missed it.
what deal did you give him?
he'll be out in five with good behavior.
good behavior...
see, that's always been a problem for me.
up on the right, boys.
is that it?
just like I told you.
come see for yourself.
here we are, boys.
Hello, beautiful.
let's see it.
you got it. Everybody back up.
weapons down-- on the ground.
I am not kidding.
rest of you guys, guns on the ground.
do it!
grenade!
ten years ago, Cooper Williams took five million dollars in cash from a bank in Century City.
now, we caught him a half an hour later.
but we never found the money.
probably heard that he escaped this weekend, and our friends at the FBI have asked for our help.
I don't have any friends in the FBI.
Yeah, just once, I want to dump a case on them. - Yeah.
Cooper shot a cop while he was escaping.
last person to see him was the DA, who he kidnapped and then kicked out of the car at Lancaster.
on the slight chance that this money might still be in Los Angeles, they figure he'll come back for it.
now, Kate and Amy, I want you to look up some of Cooper's old associates.
there's also a book written about him.
Travis, Wes, go to see the author and see if she can give us some insight, huh?
let me see the picture.
seven...
well, I took two off because it's probably airbrushed.
stop talking. - You're a pig.
you know you can report him for sexual harassment.
Oh, thanks for your support. - You're welcome.
get out. - Okay.
yes sir.
I've written about a lot of crimes.
but I've never been in the middle of an active investigation.
have you heard from him?
me? Oh, gosh, no. I wish.
well, I mean, that would be good publicity for the book.
but, um, why would he contact me?
he doesn't know anybody on the outside.
and you spent all that time interviewing him.
why would he risk getting caught by coming back to Los Angeles?
Yeah, I'm sure you're right, but we have to do this.
so, do you have any idea where he'd go if he did get out?
look, I hate to say this, but I think you guys are wasting your time.
this guy is a genius.
my partner thinks he's a genius.
look, I've interviewed hundreds of criminals, and he is the smartest one by far.
he his five million dollars in half an hour in one of the most populated cities and no one's ever found it.
yeah... Well, you may think it'd be a great idea for your book if he did contact you, but remember, this is a dangerous armed felon.
if you hear from him, you let us know, okay?
promise.
but I don't think I'm going to hear from him.
he's... - A genius. Got it.
something about this writer that bothers me.
just because a woman doesn't respond to your advances, doesn't mean there's something wrong with her.
the way she talked about him, it wasn't author-subject, you know?
he's a genius, all that crap.
I think there's more.
meanwhile, back at the evidence...
I went full-out, Wes-- I gave her the smile, the eye contact, the empathetic nods...
far be it for me to discredit the forensic value of the empathetic nod.
I'm telling you, if there was anything in there, they would have found the cash 10 years ago.
Oh, yeah? So, you're saying your not smarter than any other cop that's worked this case?
I'm smarter than at least one.
okay, robber here, caught here.
which means Cooper couldn't have gone outside this area to hide his money.
you're already wrong.
the money had to be at least 50 pounds. Thank you.
a man can't run much farther than that with that much weight.
five million dollars weighs 110 pounds exactly.
how do you... - Just... let me finish.
so he couldn't have gone any further that that.
but after he dumped it, he still had to make it to where he was caught.
and that's a row of office buildings.
What'd he do, hide it in a plant for ten years?
Yeah, I don't know.
but I just turned your big-ass circle into one square block. Here's the money.
Yeah, if it's anywhere.
that's a lot of office buildings.
Yeah, but what isn't there?
the Spencer building, that big hideous glass building.
Oh, right, okay.
it says here, construction started in November of '01.
okay, that's three months before the robbery.
so if Cooper's back in town, that's where he's going.
glad I solved it.
no wait-wait-wait-wait-wait...
you gave up like three minutes ago.
and then I solved it.
Yeah. I'm a wizard.
I am videotaping our next conversation.
keep it out front. We're LAPD.
you just going to go knocking on walls?
well, we'll take a look downstairs, find out if anyone's seen him.
Yeah, it's a long shot.
no, it's the only shot we got.
how you doing today?
I'd rather be outside.
but other than that, I'm all right.
I hear that.
Oh, the empathetic head nod.
good God.
we're detectives with the LAPD and we'd like to see your basement.
Yeah, knock yourself out.
the other detective, he's already down there.
I can't believe I was right.
say it again, I'm going to shoot you.
if I were dead, you'd finally be a better cop than me.
you all right?!
go! Go!
fire alarm...
LAPD!
move! Move! LAPD!
where is it?! Where is it?!
nice work, gentlemen.
did they valet your car?
please tell me they valeted your car.
okay, a little respect here.
we solved a 10-year-old case in five minutes.
listen to this: "From the moment Cooper strode into the room, "you could tell he was different.
he had the breezy insouciance of a movie star who just won his third Oscar.
wow, that is bad writing.
w-w-wait, this is why I got nothing from her, man.
she's in love with him.
a woman turning you down isn't evidence of anything.
but taste.
a guy's in prison for years, this ten walks in and fawns all over...
thought she was a seven.
it's a prison ten.
it makes sense.
she's his only connection on the outside.
and she's clearly crazy for him.
says you.
Hey, Captain, we, uh, wanted to...
on your case... I found the car.
it was dumped by a Metro station about two miles from where you lost them.
no sign of Cooper.
we were close.
almost good work, boys.
Thanks, Cap.
amazing you got what you did.
we were... Almost caught him, I know.
any ideas how we can catch him for reals?
nothing... solid... no.
except for the author-- Lisa Clark.
we, uh, we think there's a relationship there.
we think he may try to make contact; try to use her.
it's possible.
thanks for the support. - I said it's possible.
no, no, no, I'm not appreciated.
give me a break. It's your support.
thank you, so supportive.
Nah, well, I try... - You were right once.
all right, so you got it.
we'll set up surveillance and split the shifts with Kate and Amy.
captain, we feel good about this, don't we, partner?
Yeah.
all right, fellas, look, this is a textbook example of a challenging task.
what do you say?
we close our eyes, and we visualize a positive outcome together.
come on.
Hey, sweetheart. How's your day going?
good, good.
Hey, listen, I been thinking, uh, after I was meditating, and I had an epiphany.
how about you and I have a date night?
it's our best executive unit.
everything is top of the line.
Oh, there is one thing:
the sauna's being retiled.
so?
it's just, um... Male tenants living together tend to enjoy the sauna.
we're not... - Sauna people, no.
girl, he gets a heat rash, oh.
don't you?
my little sensitive man.
I'll let you boys settle in.
why are you pretending we're gay? Will you stop it?
it's our cover.
now, no one knows we're cops.
great.
all right, the home phone and the cell phone are already tapped.
our tech overheard her saying she's got a doctor's appointment this afternoon, so we can get on in there and plant a bug then.
Yes, I did get a warrant.
even though, no, you don't care.
all right.
so, I've got our friend at her computer.
and, uh...
Ooh, it's yoga time!
while she's writing?
no, it's her neighbor.
Travis, now what you're doing is illegal.
this should be illegal what she is doing to me-- uh!
man, if I bent like that, I'd snap in half.
bird of Paradise pose.
she needs to drop her hip and point her toes.
you can take the joy out of anything.
thank you.
man, you cook this well and still can't get a woman?
you know how to bury a compliment.
and I've cooked for you before.
with Alex, but... I always thought she did the cooking and you took all the credit.
Lisa's on the move.
Carter, this is Mitchell. Target is leaving her apartment.
we'll pick her up when she clears the building.
all right, copy that.
all right, that should buy us at least a half an hour.
she's leaving early. I knew I didn't like her.
okay, now listen to me.
you listening?
this is not a toy; this is a delicate tool.
do not scrunch, twist, crinkle, bend... - I've planted a bug before.
can you at least wash your hands first?
Yeah, all right. - That's delicate.
yeah... all right.
I'll be back.
just, uh... Just leave that anywhere, Travis. No, I'll get it later.
okay... now we're going to plant this bug, and we're going to get out of there...
right, Travis?
Travis, can you hear me?
Yeah. - Put in your earpiece!
okay, can you hear me?
Yeah, I can hear you.
testing...
please don't say testing, one, two...
one, two, three... Where you going?
why are you going into the kitchen?
see if she's got some of these cookies.
Travis, you can't go in for cookies right now.
we're on a stakeout. You're planting a bug.
we're on a schedule. You got to do this thing.
okay... When you're finished with your cookies, remember to put this thing someplace high up.
preferably not near a wire in the wall.
bingo. Letters from Cooper.
all right. Anything interesting?
well, they were all read by the prison, so there wouldn't be.
but the fact that she kept them proves my point.
you there?
target just turned around and is heading home.
all right, copy that.
Hey, Travis, you got to get out of there.
she's on her way back to the apartment.
you got to hurry hurry, okay?
come on, get it, get it, get it going.
you got it up there?
Travis, I'm not getting anything out of your microphone.
you want to check your mic?
check your mic!
I don't know what you're saying!
Tra... something's wrong with your microphone.
check your mic.
what is in that?!
why are you holding that?!
put it down! Get out of the apartment.
I don't know why you're shaking the box around.
what does that mean? I can't...
I heard that.
are you...? Are you moving your lips right now?
you're not saying anything?
good work, Detective. Good work.
okay, all right, where's the remote?
you know, this thing goes in a cradle.
can I just tell you, you've outdone yourself.
I mean, you should have your own show, The Anal Chef.
don't miss.
are you expecting anyone?
Kate and Amy aren't supposed to be here till 10: 00.
Mr. T!
let's get this party started.
captain.
Hey, Wes, my man.
Ah, you guys ate already.
eh, that's all right.
I bet I can finish this chicken all on my own.
is there really a winner in a bet like that, Cap?
any progress?
not really, no.
uh, kind of a dead end.
drink up, me hearties.
probably shouldn't on duty.
near beer.
come on, what kind of a captain do you think I am?
everything okay at home, sir?
you kiddin' me? Couldn't be better.
this therapy saved our lives.
I don't have to tell you guys that.
no, no, you don't, uh,'cause you forced us to go.
"forced" is a strong word.
it is a strong word.
it is. It's what happened, though.
when is he going to leave?
I don't think he ever is.
if you're wrong about this and Cooper never tries to contact Lisa, we're stuck with him, forever.
no, no, no, don't even say that.
don't even put that thought out there in the universe.
Hey, boys, we're going to need some more beer.
I'll go! - No, I'll go get that for ya.
don't you dare go get that... - What, the hell you will, shoot for it.
No!
Wes, my man.
park it.
so, you were telling me about your parents.
was I?
kind of doubt it.
probably wouldn't surprise you to find out that my old man was a heavy drinker, huh?
I mean, I told him I loved him once.
I actually said the words,"I love you," to which he responded,"I love food, too.
he never let me in.
never once.
Hey, Cap, was that a call?
pizza's on his way up, ma'am.
Nah, it's just the doorman letting the pizza guy up.
did she call for a pizza?
Travis, you better get in there.
guy just delivered pizza. It could be Cooper.
freeze. Don't move. Don't move.
I've got like three bucks. Take it.
all right, just relax. I'm a cop.
yeah,'cause police never shoot anyone.
okay. Who put the note in the box?
some guy was waiting for me outside the shop.
he gave me 100 bucks to put it in here.
you told me you only had three dollars, you little liar.
now, here's what you're going to do.
you're going to take this box, you're going to deliver it to the person who ordered it, and you're not going to tell her anything about us. You understand?
put the microphone pen on him so he doesn't talk.
microphone pen? - Yeah.
we only have one microphone pen. You sure you want to waste it?
they're expensive. - Put it on him. He's a liar.
Hey, all right. Relax.
remember. We're listening.
Cooper sent a note.
What'd it say?
it said,"Meet me in MacArthur Park at 6: 00 p. m. tomorrow."
Yep.
Travis, you were right-- she's in on it.
was I?
I guess I was.
listen, I'm not going to gloat about it, guys, all right?
thank you.
so I'll just simply say, uh, you know... Touchdown!
are you done?
wait.
I'm done now.
uh, before we get started, I did want to check in on a couple of things.
Clyde, how is our new strategy going?
it's not bad.
uh, every time I get a, uh, frustrated thought, I count to ten before I say it.
Oh, no, no, no, we're still having the same fights.
they're just lasting longer now.
Clyde, would you say that was fair?
he's counting.
still a little work to do.
I, uh... I've got something.
Wes and I have moved in together.
Congrats.
well, we're working on a stakeout together.
not really living together.
either way, I see it as an opportunity to work on some of the roadblocks the two of you have.
how is it going?
it's been... it's been great. It's been great.
let's... you know what, let's start with his cooking
ladies, don't let Wes cook for your husbands, or you'll lose them.
and, I mean, I'm... I'm that guy who's always lived alone, but there's something great about being able to flip on the game and having someone there to argue about it with.
you done? - Yeah.
I don't want, uh, anyone in the room to think I'm exaggerating here when I say that Travis...
Travis here is, uh, the worst roommate anyone has ever had.
he never offered to help with the cooking or the shopping.
I guess he figures there's some magical kitchen elf that just makes food appear.
that's not...
when the meal is done, he just, uh, drops the plate wherever he's standing.
I guess he wants me to clean that up.
the only time he's seen the inside of the kitchen is, uh, when he hid in there when we had a guest.
okay, you hid in there, too, man.
I practically live in there!
glasses sweating all over every tabletop.
used tissues littering the room.
he is like this selfish, destructive...
monster just leaving a trail of carnage in his wake.
and the worst part about it is, I've seen his apartment, and it's spotless.
he knows how to clean
or maybe he makes the parade of women he has over there clean up for him.
okay. Well, I think it's fair to say that you both had different experiences.
and you've been silently harboring all of this, just waiting to vomit it all out in therapy.
no wonder you and Alex didn't work out.
nobody has any idea what you're thinking!
should I start talking about how it went putting on my listening ears this week?
Hey, guys. Totally quiet.
we'll set up in the park about 5: 30.
FBI is set up in the hotel across the street.
they've got agents as homeless guys.
whole nine yards.
good. - Fine.
everything all right with you two?
good. - Fine.
okay. Have fun locked up here together all day.
I'll be in the kitchen.
let me know if you need any help finding it.
with the Marcelini team taking a nice lead as a group, two-three coming off a downward trend there.
they had a great climbing day yesterday.
really worked as a team really well and got Marcelini right in front.
if you're waiting for me to clean up, you can keep waiting.
that's great.
I love it like this.
...that long, uphill stretch.
What'd you do to the TV?
did you do something to the remote?
Oh, you took the batteries out.
okay. That's fine.
um, I like bike... the Tour de Whatever.
you hate it.
which makes me love it more.
don't you touch it.
Hey, Ice King, not everybody wants to see their breath indoors.
it's a perfect 72 degrees in here right now.
not anymore.
Travis, if you're cold, you can put another layer on.
if I'm hot, I got to suffer.
you what? - I suffer.
we can do it all day. - I'll do it all day, man.
what is that? - Chicken parm.
isn't that, uh... isn't that your favorite?
I suppose you didn't make me any.
good work, Detective.
she's going.
early again.
you must love her.
good God.
needs salt.
FBI in position.
LAPD in position.
Amy, you got eyes on her?
we got her.
okay.
so, she was a little squirrelly on the ride over here.
something might be off.
we definitely shouldn't move in till we know it's, uh, Cooper, all right?
good talk.
you both really blend in here nicely.
Hey, I got a jogger.
all agents, this is Valtini.
get ready to move in on my... - Can we just make sure?
is it him? Is it Cooper?
I can't get a clear view.
I see him. It's not him.
repeat, not Cooper.
pick him up. Make sure.
she's heading back to her car. We'll stay with her.
thanks for wasting our time.
you see what's going on here?
she's playing us, man.
she's testing to see if she's being followed.
what happened in here?
do you slobs expect us to clean up after you?
I'm teaching Travis a lesson.
I'm driving Wes crazy while he's trying to teach Travis a lesson.
it's like a million degrees in here.
Seriously?
you weren't here.
you don't know what he's like.
so, what was all that in the park?
I think it was a test.
we know this Cooper's careful.
he wanted to make sure Lisa wasn't being followed, so he set this whole thing up.
did someone buzz up?
no, no calls.
it's him. Cooper's in the apartment.
what just happened?
she shot him.
self-defense?
you murdered him in cold blood. I was watching.
you two warned me.
this was a dangerous felon.
now, I keep a registered gun, and when he showed up and lunged at me, I defended myself.
he opened his arms to hug you.
and he looked confused, and you shot him.
maybe that's what it looked like, but it's not what happened.
what about the note in the pizza and the meet in the park?
I'm a crime writer.
you wouldn't believe the kooky ways people try to get in contact with me.
you saved the note.
well, I save all the letters I get.
you never know what will come in handy.
here's what I think.
I think you two fell in love.
he breaks out-- hell, maybe you help him break out.
maybe you planted that gun.
and when he busts out and gets the money and he comes to you and says "Let's run away together," you think,"What kind of life is living on the run?
if I shoot him, I get all the money.
I know how this all must look, but I'm as surprised as you are that he showed up.
sorry.
you have any questions, partner?
no, I'm good.
Hey, I saw her murder him.
if I tried to indict her, I'd get laughed out of the grand jury.
you have a cop as an eyewitness!
I've got an escaped con carrying a gun breaking into her apartment.
okay, what about the money?
that's the FBI's problem.
missing money's still missing money.
captain, I'm telling you, there is more to this You got to believe me.
I'm sorry, guys.
you got Cooper.
and your instincts were right.
Travis. Travis. - What?
what are we gonna do? - We?
you could try having my back.
I just witnessed a murder.
you're not gonna get a conviction, and the DA just said he doesn't care.
you know what, man?
you haven't had my back this entire case.
if you have a theory, I'd run it into the ground with you.
I might argue with you, yeah, but I'd have your back.
as a your partner, you gotta let this thing go.
all we have to do is stay on her and see if she's goes for the cash.
you better hurry, because she just left.
where you going?
to stake out the pizza place.
Travis... - I don't care what she says, Wes, all right?
I know Cooper sent that note.
and if I were him, and I wanted to hide a message in a pizza box,
I would order it from the nearest place to where I'm hiding.
I'm betting anything the money is still around there somewhere.
it's just a "feeling," but I'm pretty sure I'm right about it.
all right, let's go. - No, no. Do not do me any favors.
how we doing over here, Mike?
any word from your wife yet?
she'll be here. Traffic. A few minutes, huh?
it's been over an hour, and we're getting pretty backed up.
is there any chance I can get you to wait at the bar?
I'll get you another order of gnocchi on the house.
look, just give her a few more minutes, huh?
just, just hold on.
Ah, here she is.
Yeah, I figured traffic. What? Sure.
Hey, look, I got a bottle of wine chilling here.
I'll see you when you get home.
she, uh... - Caught in traffic.
Yeah. Look, I'll take that gnocchi to go, huh?
of course.
is this a bad time?
that, that's not gonna end well.
hands up. You know the drill.
hands up. You know the drill.
one-hand cuffing, huh?
you police?
prison guard.
I see.
Oh, I see, okay.
the author comes to prison to interview the inmate for her new book.
you get to know the prison guard who's there for all the interviews.
the prisoner has a bunch of money hidden somewhere, and you two get to thinking, - "Hmm, maybe we could get our hands on it." - Congrats.
you almost solved the crime.
I've been getting a lot of that lately.
dude, she used you to help Cooper escape.
she didn't use me.
it was my idea.
Oh, she let you think that, too, huh?
put him in the car. We can't shoot him here.
let's go.
all right, let me see those hands.
get 'em up!
get her! Get her!
Hey, guys, we found your money. It's right here.
Yeah, no need to thank us.
we're happy to help out.
I hate the FBI.
look, uh, you were right.
you would have had my back.
I'm just happy that I was right.
about everything.
well, let's not forget about who got the money, who saved your ass.
Yeah, you cut it a little close though, didn't ya?
well, I saw her pull that gun on you, I figured I'd give you a little distraction.
worked out nicely.
Yeah, but if you'd been there a few minutes earlier, I might not have had a gun on me at all.
well, my partner taught me that being late's as good as being early.
Oh, that is absolutely not what I said.
that's not what you said? - That's not what I said.
I thought... What did you say?
no, what I said was that... See?
you don't even know what you said.
Hey, I have something to say to you.
you are a horrible roommate.
and a terrible cook, but you really pushed this case along and you got good instincts.
I'm gonna do what I can to support that in the future.
no, you're not.
you know how you said that my place is spotless in therapy?
Yeah. Look, I'm sorry about that.
I was... - Wes...
my home is permanent.
it's mine, man.
I know it can never be taken away from me, so I take care of it.
growing up in foster homes...
I always knew it was just a temporary stop on my way to the next one.
and I guess I figured that if I cared about it...
I'd get real messed up when I had to leave.
Yeah, I get that.
all right.
crap, you know what?
I forgot my keys.
I'll see you down there, okay?
all right, cool.
Wes, you're early.
uh, do you need a minute? 'Cause I can just wait out in the hall.
no, sit. Come, sit.
I've been wanting to have a word with you in private, anyway.
okay.
how do you feel it's going? Therapy?
well, I hated it at first.
but it is occasionally... helpful.
I can't tell you how happy I am to hear you say that.
you are the most complicated patient I have ever had.
do you think you're ready to go to the next step?
next step?
you and me. Private sessions.
because there is a connection there, Wes.
don't pretend you haven't felt it.
I, uh...
people are gonna be here any minute.
any minute.
what do you say, Wes?
we have to get you ready for the first exercise.
Travis, it's not even 7: 00 in the morning.
never too early to catch a bad guy.
come on, get up, man. Get out of bed. Just got a break in the hijacking case.
get up, get up, get up, get up.
that's Barry Kennefick.
his buddies at the Port call him Barry Forty because...he likes malt liquor.
anyway, Forensics has just been scrubbing the computers of all the dispatchers at the Port.
turns out Barry's been sending off e-mails from a private account, one for every truck that's been jacked on its way out.
okay, so Barry's tipping off the hijackers. All right.
Yeah, giving up the routes and describing the cargo.
I figure we lean on him hard enough, maybe he'll give up the actual thieves.
so when's he getting here?
well, he's not working today.
I guess he'll be home eventually.
Yeah. Yeah.
you ever dream about Dr. Ryan?
no. Why?
no.
you? - No!
never mind.
no, no, no. What kind of dreams you been having about Dr. Ryan?
look, I... I don't want to...
fine. They're just, you know, they're... dreams.
okay. You dirty dog, you.
it's involuntary, okay?
I mean, I can't help it.
ever since she showed up with that ring on her finger.
I can't help but think about it.
her personal life, you know?
Yeah, how many dreams? What happened? How's she smell? How's she feel?
leave nothing out. - Travis, that's between... All right, that's between me and her, okay?
no, it's between you and the dream version of her.
you got to be so smart, don't you?
I'm trying to confide something in you...
confide in me, brother. - And you're being smart.
trust me. I want to hear all the details... - That's him.
thank God.
this conversation isn't over.
LAPD.
why do they always think they can get away?
I don't know.
got him.
you might want to consolidate those keys.
just keep the important ones.
make them easier to find when you're in a jam.
like this.
put them down. Get out of the car.
I'm cooperating here, guys.
I'll give you names, phone numbers... - Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay, we'll get to that.
so, these dreams-- did you have one last night?
Travis, I do not want to talk about it.
you brought it up.
in a moment of weakness, I brought it up.
you were confiding in me.
we spend a lot of time together.
I think it's perfectly natural that she shows up in my dreams, all right?
was she naked? She was naked.
Oh, man. - Wait, wait, wait.
weird question: I'm definitely awake right now, right?
not dreaming?
Yeah. how?
Dietz. - Yeah, what's up?
Hey, man, uh, can you take this guy to the box for us, please?
Yeah, you got it.
you're not gonna say anything, right?
Dr. Ryan.
Hey, Wes was just talking about you.
what brings you down here?
Hey, guys, I'm, uh, I'm just, I'm waiting for Captain Sutton.
you okay?
Yes. Fine.
sorry. I'm rattled.
um, Robert, my fiance, was attacked last night.
go ahead.
sweetie, it's all good.
I keep telling her it's not so bad.
you should see the other guys, they got some pretty serious abrasions on their knuckles.
detective Marks, Detective Mitchell, This is my fiance Robert Ewell.
how's it going, bro?
Travis. - All right.
God, you look different than I pictured.
not that I've been... picturing you.
I recognize you from the news.
I saw you on the-- You were building malls.
on the east side, right?
Yeah, marketing people prefer to call them open-air retail communities, but guilty.
so, um, what happened to you?
I'm building this new development in Atwater Village.
I was just working late last night, and a couple kids jumped me on the way to my car...
we talked about this.
Yeah, we did talk about this.
guys, don't have to get involved in this.
it's a conflict of interest.
what? Why? - Why is there a conflict of interest?
she does not talk about her work at home.
I promise you that.
but I did know that she was working with a couple of cops.
I just assumed that it was a man and a woman.
no, just us.
okay, you're done with your statement?
I am. - Thank you so much.
guys, I will see you both later. - Yeah.
we'll do what we can to catch these guys that tuned you up.
I appreciate that, Captain, but seriously...
please do not break your back on my account.
it was a mugging. I got to go.
and honestly, I would not even of come down here to make a report if this one had not insisted.
nice to meet you.
no. No "huh."
she's your doctor, huh?
you stay away from this, all right?
I gave the case to Stiefvater and Rafalski.
Stiefvater and Rafalski?
captain, What are you, mad at Dr. Ryan?
no. They were working the night tour last night.
so I gave them the case.
Plus, you guys have a hijacking ring to break up.
you're gonna e-mail your contacts in this hijacking ring.
you're gonna tell them there's a truck headed out today that they're gonna want to rob.
what should I tell them is in it?
what are they looking for?
air bags?
why would anybody want to steal 800 airbags?
black market for everything, man.
does he seem kind of like a... weatherman?
who?
Dr. Ryan's fianc.
you got a developer?
I always saw her with someone more serious.
Yeah, yeah, someone intense, huh?
brooding?
someone who nobly fights his tendency to irritate others?
you think you are so smart. I'm not talking about me.
Yes, you are. - No, I'm not.
Yes, you are. I mean, listen, subconscious doesn't lie.
Travis, that guy blow dries his hair.
Dr. Ryan has substance.
she volunteers her time to treat us.
think about that.
surprises me she'd be seeing a guy who builds malls, that's all.
Yeah, but... I mean, really, you don't really know her, and you sure as hell don't know him, so why would you be surprised?
you're a terrible conversationalist, you know that?
here we go.
I think you should tell her. Hmm?
what?
Dr. Ryan, I think you should tell her that you've developed serious, passionate...feelings for her. - What?!
Yeah. - No.
a: I haven't developed any feelings, and B: No.
LAPD! Don't move. Get down on the ground. Right now.
now!
slowly.
easy...
you okay? - Yeah.
go, go, go, go!
put the cuffs on him now.
LAPD!
put your hands in the air! Do it!
you're out of there!
nice play at the plate, baby.
you're under arrest.
Yeah!
all right!
you see that, Dietz?
Hey, you know what?
I think I'm gonna have to tell Dr. Ryan about them dreams.
what?
Yeah, I'm gonna have to tell her.
you can't do that?
why not?
cause, you know-- Bro Code.
no, no.
see, you don't subscribe to Bro Code.
we already been through this.
are you guys gonna read me my rights?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we'll get to that.
let me ask you a question: Catcher's mask?
what's wrong with the catcher's mask? They're cool.
I can still see your face, dumb-ass!
that's one hijacking ring off the books.
let's pull out some open cases and see what we can attack next, huh?
Yeah, we could do that.
should do that.
what else would we do?
Yeah, Mr. Mitchell, I... this is...
Stiefvater's here?
what's he doing working the day shift?
I don't know. But we could ask him how it's going with Dr. Ryan's thing.
we're not supposed to get involved.
we're just checking up.
no rule against that, right?
that's a business expense.
Yes, seriously.
I have a stressful job, i.e.I need a place in Ojai to unwind, i.e.business expense.
you know, I think you're saying "i. e." where you mean "ergo.
I-I gotta go.
what do you guys want?
well, you caught a mugging.
how's it going?
Sutton told me not to talk to you guys about that.
you make any arrests yet?
I got a full caseload, and I'm getting audited.
you think we got time to work a favor job for Sutton?
I think you caught a case. You should work it.
I am working it.
I gotta go, guys.
that's fine. Okay.
keep up the good work.
you got it?
indeed, I did.
Dr. Ryan's is a woman of substance.
she deserves a much better class of detective.
upstairs. - Downtown.
so, weatherman Bob goes by his construction site in the middle of the night.
not a weatherman. He's one of the most successful builders in L. A.
okay, fine.
so, the builder goes there to check, make sure his equipment's all stocked, and he gets jumped by two African-Americans on the way back to his BMW.
Yeah. about that, they just ran up and clocked him?
he didn't even see their faces
these construction site's have a lot of valuable stuff lying around.
I'm sure there's a night watchman on duty.
abort.
Hey, I got a captains' meeting in here in a little while.
what are you guys doing in here?
well, we wrapped up the hijacking, so we're just reviewing open cases.
and you can't do that from your own desk?
Oh, it's too loud out there, Cap.
have a good meeting. - Yeah.
robert Ewell has you working nights?
Yeah, I was on shift last night.
but I'm confused.
one guy hit Mr. Ewell, and he wasn't black.
you're sure?
positive.
but I heard a call coming in, so I went to the front gate.
a guy had just let himself in. Had a key and everything.
why didn't you call the police?
Mr. Ewell told me not to.
Mr. Ewell lied to us.
I knew there was something off about him.
what did the attacker look like?
he was, like, mid-20s.
dark skin, but like European dark.
armenian, Turkish, something like that.
is this the spot?
Yeah. Everything looks normal.
I don't think he took anything.
sorry.
you seeing what I'm seeing?
Yeah.
it's not even done setting yet.
this poured concrete, did one of the workers lay this in?
I've been absolutely dying to use this thing.
the department wouldn't spring for it, so I finally broke down and got it myself.
you paid for that thing on your own?
one of the advantages of flipping your company before you're 30.
that's gonna tell us what's in there, huh?
Yep.
it uses ultrasound.
well, looks like nothing.
wait, hold on.
there we go.
what is that, a face?
Hey, there. Who are you?
Hey, what's going on?
why'd you guys call me down here?
we need to talk to you about last night.
I thought you weren't supposed to be looking into that.
well, we were naughty.
but you know a little something about that, don't you?
what's this?
there's a dead guy down in there?
who is he?
we were wondering if you could tell us that, Robert.
I have no idea!
you lied about getting mugged, Robert.
your word doesn't have a whole lot of credibility right now.
and I get that.
look, I am sorry about that.
but... but this?
come on. I build things.
I don't get involved in this kind of thing.
then who beat you up?
I don't know.
honestly, I don't.
I am in construction.
I'm not a criminal, but if I want to get anything done, sometimes I have to do business with them.
did you do business with criminals here?
the head of the Steam and Pipe Fitters' Union is a man named Aram Parisyan.
he is not a great guy, from what I've heard.
I had to issue him a payment to ensure that my workers would show up.
cash. - You bribed him.
this is the way the construction business works, okay?
now, Parisyan, he thought that gave him the run of the place.
he wanted keys, he told me his people were gonna be coming through day and night.
and I said no, but obviously somehow they got keys anyway.
was Aram Parisyan here last night?
no, just that guy.
tell us about him.
he was driving a Mercedes.
and he held up his fist before hit me, he had tattoos, like, letters on his knuckles.
"R. I. P." on one hand-- like Rest in Peace
and "Anna" on the other.
guys, guys, know that I'm not in a position to ask, but you have, you have to do me a favor.
I mean, Emma and I... we're planning a wedding in Descanso Gardens in two months.
you just can't tell her about this.
I know I was wrong to pay that bribe, I know that.
and the only reason I lied about it to you was that so Emma wouldn't find out.
really, I'm not a bad guy, okay?
I just got in over my head here.
I was specific when I told you to stay the hell away from this case!
whoa, Cap. Deep breaths, man.
let's find your little happy place, man. How about some serenity?
I'll find my happy place.
I had my happy place until you walked into this room and set these pictures on my desk!
okay, you're mad.
Really?
just tell us what you want us to do here.
you got a body.
you got to work it.
we are working it, Cap. We got the medical examiner's office is digging the body out of the concrete.
we're trying to get an I. D.
we sent a description of the ink on the guy's knuckles to Gang squads, but what I'm asking is what do you want us to do about Dr. Ryan, Captain?
what about her?
well, the man she's planning to marry bribed some gangsters who buried a corpse at his construction site.
everyone makes bribes in the construction business.
it doesn't mean that Ewell's a bad guy.
no, but maybe Dr. Ryan should decide whether or not he's a bad guy.
maybe you should let him decide. - Enough.
that's what I want... - That's enough!
I happen to know this guy.
he paid a bribe, and then he lied about it.
I'm not saying that's the right thing to do, but we don't have the right to put our noses in Dr. Ryan's business!
when's your next session?
in about 45 minutes. - Later tonight.
okay. Listen to me. This girl's responsible for changing my life, and God bless her, she's actually trying to do the same thing for you two guys.
stay the hell out of it!
just go to the session and be your usual stupid selves!
no problem.
Wes has got lots to talk to her about, anyway.
no, I don't.
what's going on, kid?
Wes is having sex dreams about Dr. Ryan. - No, no.
Oh, sex dreams.
what do you mean, "Yeah, the sex dreams"?
you having 'em, too?
well, I did. It's, it's natural.
see? That's what I was saying.
you should talk to her about it.
see? Now that's what I was saying.
Travis, you say a one word, I'll kill you where you're sitting.
Hey, Dr. Ryan. How's it going?
so... what is on the agenda for tonight?
it's up to the group, isn't it?
how come we never talk about dreams in here?
do you want to talk about dreams?
I think Wes would love to.
okay, I not going to be held hostage here.
I'm a cop, a cop knows how to deal with a blackmail threats.
you put it everything on the table.
you reclaim your power.
so, I've been having dreams about you.
go on.
Yes, please, go on.
they're are, uh... scintillating in nature.
and I can't help it.
I really would like 'em to stop, so please help me make them go away.
Oh, Wes, you don't have to be embarrassed.
it's very common.
in fact, it's probably my favorite side effect of therapy.
you're happy about this?
well, I'm flattered.
haven't you been dreaming about me?
uh... no. - No?
you don't find me attractive?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, sure I... I do.
Ab-Absolutely.
Oh, good.
let's get to work.
Wes, would you excuse us?
Yeah. - Yeah.
could you tell the others that I'm gonna need 20 minutes alone with my patient?
damn it!
Oh, this is all your fault.
what? What?
I caught the dreams from you.
they're dreams, Travis. Not the flu.
morning, Wes. Just give me a minute while I finish up with our friend here.
no problem.
Hi, Jonelle.
right.
so, they always start in therapy.
what?
my dream.
yeah?
me, too.
listen, no details, but, uh...
it almost started just like our last therapy session.
you got there early, it's a little bit awkward, then things start happening...differently.
we started talking about your dreams.
you sold me out to Dr. Ryan?
you sold me out to Dr. Ryan in your dream.
it was a dream.
no. Subconscious doesn't lie.
okay, listen, okay, okay, just hear me out.
this has to stop, okay?
it took me a long time to accept the fact that Dr. Ryan was a no-fly zone.
I can't let my deviant subconscious start to mess with that.
what am I supposed to do about the dream?
you boys getting are hot for teacher.
how much of that did you hear?
only the good parts.
so, I guess I have you two to thank so very, very much for keeping me on my toes.
it's not every day that I get to use a jackhammer to identify a corpse.
it's exhausting.
uh, what did you learn?
your John Doe died from blunt force trauma.
he was wearing a track suit, so it looks like somebody jumped him while he was jogging.
I got some DNA from the assailant underneath his fingernails, but no match to the assailant's DNA, but, however, your John Doe is in the system.
his name is Craig Joseph Seward.
Yeah. - I know that name.
of course you do. He's one of the worst lawyers on the planet.
well, he was.
if you've been arrested for a D.U.I., don't let the government trample on your rights.
I'm five-star D. U.I. Defense Attorney Craig J. Seward, and I'm ready to go to war for you.
I hate that guy.
Yeah. Everybody hates that guy.
why would the Armenian mob want him killed?
you mean, besides his commercials?
have to find out if there's a connection between Seward and the man that Dr. Ryan's fianc was paying off.
Parisyan? - Yeah.
all right, we'll get to that later.
listen, the gang squad found a match for those R. I.P. Anna tattoos in their photo file.
they belong to a guy named Karl Rezian.
he did two years for aggravated assault.
okay, so where do we find him?
he told his parole officer he has a job at a dog shelter in Atwater Village.
I guess Anna was a dog.
Yeah, Anna was one of our best reclamation projects.
reclamation projects?
we rescue fighting dogs here.
I have some literature if you guys want to learn more about it.
LAPD.
we need to speak to a Karl Rezian, please.
uh, yeah, he's in the back.
thank you.
Yes.
LAPD.
can we talk to you for a minute?
attack, Shirley!
you get the dog. I'm gonna get the car.
how do I get the dog?!
see that? It's shiny, isn't it?
just like a human liver.
want that? Go get it!
Freeze! You're under arrest for the murder of Craig Seward.
down on your knees. Down!
what did he do to you, Karl?
why did you murder Craig Seward?
I didn't kill anybody.
we've got two people who can place you where his body was found, Karl.
your DNA test results are gonna be back any minute, and if they match what we found on Seward's body, you're gonna go away...
forever.
I didn't kill anybody.
that's all I'm saying.
you heard the man. He's done talking.
gentlemen, Timothy Mullin, counsel to Mr. Rezian.
I didn't call a lawyer.
no. My services are provided for you free of charge.
let me guess. By Aram Parisyan?
no, that's no concern of yours.
are we done here?
we sure as hell are not done here.
DNA's back.
and I guess that concludes our business.
let's go, Karl.
I don't think it does. Sit down, Karl.
look, even if you didn't kill Craig Seward, you dumped the body for whoever did, didn't you?
we're gonna go pick up your boss, so if there's anything you want to say to us before we put cuffs on him, you should say it.
as it happens, I also represent Aram Parisyan.
Yeah, what a coincidence.
he's aware that his name has come up during this investigation, and he's willing to offer his full cooperation.
gentlemen, let me introduce you to Aram Parisyan.
Hey, guys, how you doing?
you get in a fight?
what, this?
no, I just had my nose done again.
again?
Yeah, well, you know, we keep, uh... refining.
I actually went in for an eye lift, but my guy offered me a rate.
would your guy have some contact information?
Absolutely.
Hey, uh, if you mention I referred you, he'll give me a discount on my next procedure.
okay, well, this isn't a referral. We're just confirming your story.
all right.
why would you think I wanted plastic surgery?
Hey, we're all racing Father Time.
doesn't hurt to get a head start.
Yeah. That's awesome.
listen, the lab is down on the third floor, and the lab tech will take your DNA swab.
Oh, that's okay. I brought my own.
this is a piece of my, uh, columella.
that's like the, um... the little nub that divides up your nose?
my guy took a whack at it yesterday, gave me that as a keepsake.
should be some good DNA in there.
okay. We'll stick with the usual procedures.
thank you.
all right, suit yourself.
lab's on the third floor.
all right. Take care, guys.
good seeing you, man.
thanks for your cooperation. Really good to see you.
okay. That was strange and disgusting, but...
most murderers don't usually provide their own DNA sample.
well, we'll find out soon enough.
even if Parisyan's not a match, we've still got Karl Rezian for dumping that body.
Yeah, but if we ask Robert Ewell to testify, Dr. Ryan's gonna know what he did.
security guard can put Rezian at the scene.
okay. Sounds good.
Hey, man, sweet dreams.
thank you
shut up.
good morning, everyone. I'm sorry I'm late.
morning.
good sleep?
I can't take it much more.
you too, huh?
okay, let's get started.
Wes is having dirty dreams about you.
how does he get it to stop? - What the hell is wrong with you?
look, he's having dirty dreams, too, okay?
I had, like, two. You had, like, a hundred.
okay, first of all, I did not have a hundred, Travis.
I'm not a degenerate, and secondly,
I don't see why we have to embarrass Dr. Ryan by bringing this up.
I'm not embarrassed.
I'm encouraged.
Oh, no. You're not gonna stand up and take off your dress, are you?
no. Never mind.
um, erotic dreams are an extremely common occurrence in therapy.
it's called transference.
you're hardly the first people in the room to have experienced it.
Really?
you had the dreams, too?
cool.
I'd say it's happened to about half my patients.
it's a little uncomfortable on both sides, but it's a sign that the therapy's working.
Really? - It is?
Yes, it means that your mind has metabolized what we're doing in here.
it's seeped into your thoughts.
hence, the dreams.
okay, hold on.
so, you want us to have dirty dreams about you?
I want you to have breakthroughs.
I want you to change your lives and how you relate to each other.
this is just a signpost along the way.
but it's a significant one, because it means that you have committed to therapy on a subconscious level.
great. - Uh, okay, all right.
keep right on dreaming, then.
right.
I, uh... I'm sorry, but he's not in there.
what?
I'm sorry, but the guy that drove onto the lot that night-- he's not there.
look again.
that's enough.
wait, wait, wait. Did Parisyan threaten you?
because if he did, we can protect you.
that's enough.
we had a lineup, there was no I. D. End of story.
I'm sorry. - Yeah.
Rezian's DNA doesn't match the killer.
Parisyan's DNA does not match the killer.
our witnesses recanting their testimony... - One witness.
we make Robert Ewell go on record, this thing goes public.
Dr. Ryan knows exactly what her fianc did...
if Ewell doesn't testify, the only thing you have on this Rezian character is that he sicced a dog on you.
now, you guys started it, you gotta live with the consequences.
I don't know what to do here, guys.
a couple of Aram Parisyan's... buddies came to my office yesterday.
and they made it very clear that I shouldn't say anything about what I saw.
well, we're pretty sure the other witness got the same treatment, 'cause he's not talking to us either.
Yeah, can you blame him?
I mean, you can have my DNA, fine. But...
other than that, we're-we're talking about my family here.
okay. We will protect your family.
what does that mean?
what, I... I get to tell my fianc that we're going to have cops following us around all the time?
we've been doing everything we can to keep you out of this, but if you don't cooperate with us right now, a man who buried another man in concrete, at your construction site... he walks.
okay. Dr. Ryan is a good woman.
and you don't think she'd really want that, do you?
she's a great woman.
and there she is.
well, we can go.
Hi, darling...
what are you doing here?
uh, Detective Mitchell and Marks have been investigating my case.
what?
no, I asked you to stay out of it.
Yeah. We-we know.- Yeah. We know.
we didn't mean to, it was this other detective, he wasn't very good...
Yeah. And so we took his file, and we decided we were gonna try...
Mistake?... - and follow up on it. It was a mistake.
could someone please tell me what is going on?
Yes. We need to talk.
let's go upstairs.
how pissed off do you think she's gonna be?
how pissed off would you be?
robert will identify the man.
he'll testify at any trial.
he'll provide you with a DNA sample that proves he had nothing to do with this murder.
we spent the night together, we had dinner, we went to bed...
we were both woken by the phone call.
he told me he had to check on something at work.
thank you.
Yeah.
listen, uh, Dr. Ryan, we were just trying to... - Is there anything else you need?
no. - Good.
pissed. - Yeah.
we have a witness that puts you at the site of the murder.
that's conspiracy after the fact.
you'll do 20 years, Karl.
add that to the time you're facing for siccing your pit bull on us...
you should get free just in time to start collecting Social Security checks, Karl.
stop trying to intimidate my client.
Karl, a lot can happen at a trial.
Yeah. We could just decide to charge him with Craig Seward's murder.
make a circumstantial case out of it.
I didn't kill him!
you don't have to talk to these men.
shut up! I didn't even hire you.
Karl. Talk to us.
tell us what happened.
we'll ask the D. A. to cut a deal. You might only do five years.
I got an e-mail.
told me to go to the fountain in Riverside Park and bring the trash over to that construction site.
I got there, that guy's body was stuffed under a bench.
so I cleaned up the garbage.
who sent the e-mail?
so his DNA's wasn't found on Seward's body, but he gave Rezian the order to dispose of that corpse.
that's conspiracy.
let's see if that's enough to convince him to give up the murderer.
Hey, Mullin... what are you doing?
give me that!
give it to me.
don't let him go anywhere. He just committed a felony.
Maxine, I gotta leave early today...
you want me to forward your calls?
take messages...
damn it!
stay down. Stay down!
my nose isn't set yet!
my, uh... my bad.
if you expect my client to cooperate, let me assure you you're dead wrong.
be quiet.
we're charging you the second we're done here.
with what? I advised my client of a development, that's all.
Oh, come on. - I'm still Aram Parisyan's attorney...
you told him to run, Mullin.
why would he run?
you got the word of a convicted felon that says, what?
he sent an e-mail?
he conspired to cover up a murder.
and Rezian's gonna give up the cell phone where he checked the e-mail.
anyone could have borrowed my client's phone.
is that the defense you're planning on using?
because if that's the case, I suggest you find new counsel, Mr. Parisyan.
who killed Craig Seward?
you don't have to do this, Aram.
Oh, shut up, Tim!
it's over, man.
I'm sorry.
stop him!
get him out of here.
all right, Cap!
always wanted to do that to a lawyer.
nicely done. - Yeah.
all right.
let's get back.
Mullin. - I know.
should've known by the suit.
it turns out that Aram Parisyan and his lawyer have been friends since they were kids.
now, Timothy Mullin and Craig Seward, they went to law school together.
mullin got a DUI a little while back, so he hired his old schoolmate to represent him.
see, the thing is... Mullin started talking about the work he was doing for Aram Parisyan.
he said some things he shouldn't have.
Seward started blackmailing him.
mullin paid for a few months, Seward tried to up the payments, then Mullin snapped.
he called Aram Parisyan to get rid of the body.
Parisyan just farmed out that disposal out to Karl Rezian.
now, Mullin, Parisyan, Rezian, all these guys are in jail now.
they're not gonna bother your family anymore.
thank you.
okay.
um, listen, Dr. Ryan... we owe you an apology.
well, you did what you're trained to do.
you're not wearing your engagement ring.
look, uh, this is none of our business.
you know relationships.
we know criminals.
your fianc got involved in some stuff, made some mistakes...
you did what you're trained to do, and I'm going to do the same.
so, gentlemen, we have a conflict of interest.
I'm terminating your therapy.
what?
there's a group that meets over in Hollywood under Dr. Van Waals.
I'm going to refer you over to him.
wait. Hold on. Don't do this.
you're a good doctor.
Yeah. We're-we're metabolizing therapy.
we're doing better... We like you.
regardless.
we are where we are.
okay, I'm sorry.
Travis said it, I didn't say it.
it's better that I know.
but I can't help you if I can't trust you.
I wish you the best of luck.
you ready for this?
I don't really want to break in a new therapist.
well, then, you shouldn't have stolen that case file, Travis.
what are you talking about? You wanted me to steal it.
I never said to steal it.
you didn't have to say anything...
I just said,Let's check in on Doctor...
I do not care to!
let's just... go.
man: You're the one that wanted this divorce.
do you hear that?
no, it is not my problem, Susan, it is your problem!
you want the divorce, that's just fine!
but my lawyers are gonna grind you into dust!
and I'm gonna take that dust and put it in a jar on a shelf next to a picture of my new wife, who, in addition to being younger and hotter than you, is also gonna be dumber so she's gonna go for the freaking pre-nup!
Geez!
welcome.
you here for...?
Yeah. Yeah. You, too.
and just in time, huh?
well, actually, uh... no.
I'm Dr. Van Waals. I'm your new therapist, and...
the thing is... you weren't supposed to hear any of that.
we've really need to get Dr. Ryan to take us back.
Hells, yeah.
cause this guy is... - Okay.
please. Come into the safe circle.
let's sit, and let's find some inner peace with a deep, cleansing breath.
male DISPATCHER: We have India 114, 116, and 260 in position.
flight 104 is 500 yards in trail, waiting for your go.
that's it, right there. There's our guy.
begin your final approach to the target.
pilot ON RADIO: Flight 104, copy that.
ANDY: Shit!
Walter, wake up. Customs.
what? Who?
we need the fucking bag. Where the fuck is the key?
CBP OFFICER: Tighten that line. Now secure the other side.
easy, easy up.
okay, okay.
hurry up. Come on, put it in the bag.
come on!
CBP OFFICER: Pull this up. Come on, come on. Let's go!
WALTER: Go, Andy.
CBP OFFICER: Stop! Federal officer! Don't move!
excuse me. Excuse me, y'all. Can I have everybody's attention?
I want to do a quick toast to the bride and groom, Danny and Shelly.
Congratulations.
I can't believe it, man. I'm fucking married, Chris.
Danny, I know. I was standing right there with you.
look, what about this fucking guy?
he's my best friend, best man at my wedding.
he doesn't even remember that this is where my reception was.
thank God he's sober.
you don't remember?
I remember throwing up on Kate's shoes.
Yeah, I remember, too.
I apologized for that.
everybody, do it like this.
TOMMY: I mean, you were like the Lennon and McCartney of smuggling.
how do you smuggle a fucking Ferrari? Where do you hide it?
CHRIS: We didn't.
we let customs seize it in port.
give me your phone.
SEBASTIAN: You take the guts out.
the transmission, the wiring system.
take all that shit out, hide it inside other containers.
so, when customs auctions off the car, he gets himself a Ferrari for next to nothing.
he just bought the empty shell?
Yes, he got the empty shell at the auction.
and then we...
sell him the missing parts. ...sold him back the guts.
and he's got himself a new Ferrari for less than you paid for that piece-of-shit Honda.
it's a nice Honda.
Yeah, that's why you live in it, right?
because it's a nice fucking Honda.
can I dance with my wife?
Hey, what's up, buddy?
can I get another one of these when you get a chance?
Hey, Chris.
church, hey.
how are you doing, man?
long time, no see. Where you been?
well, I'm living out in Algiers now.
the fuck are you doing out there?
it's nice, I like it out there.
it's good for the family.
a guy like you don't belong in Algiers, Chris.
what are you doing for work?
I started my own business, setting up alarm systems.
fill that up, will you?
your old man getting jailed freak you out? Huh?
I guess.
that, and having a wife and two little boys, you know?
Yeah.
you've got to stick to what you're good at, though, Chris.
listen, I offered to take care of that ship captain for your dad.
he said no.
anyway, Chris, if you're ever thinking of getting back in, let me know, okay?
yeah?
Yeah. Good.
I don't even know why we're doing this in the first place.
just trust me, okay? It will be cool.
if we try to run, it will make it worse.
where are these guys?
here we go, here we go.
be cool, now.
here we go, here we go.
ANDY: Hey, man.
customs boarded us, we had to dump the package.
you did?
we had no choice.
right?
nothing we could do, man.
that's it.
what did I say? I told you it was cool.
WALTER: Come on, man, let's get the fuck out of here.
Hello?
it's my brother.
what happened? Is he okay?
no. We've got to go now.
what?
CHRIS: Walter is in surgery.
what the fuck happened, Andy?
it was an accident.
you know what? You're a shitty liar, so don't even fucking try.
look at me when I'm talking to you.
I was running something.
we got boarded, and I dumped it.
you dumped what?
the coke.
Kate: Oh, fuck.
ANDY: It was over 10 pounds.
for who?
for Tim Briggs and those guys.
they're going to kill me.
Andy, they're not going to kill you.
ANDY: It was a lot of stuff.
I'm sorry.
you should be fucking sorry.
is he all right?
no, the little fuckhead was running something and he dumped it. Now he owes.
who? Who does he owe?
tim Briggs.
ask around, see what you can find out, all right?
how is Kate?
not good.
CHRIS: I can't believe he did that.
when I quit, I told him to stay away from these guys.
please, if you had anything to do with this, just tell me right now.
I just told you.
okay.
he's my little brother.
I know. I'm going to take care of it.
I got you.
Kate: I'll call you in the morning.
JEANIE: Okay, no problem.
good night.
CHRIS: So you said King Security put the system in?
that's right. A lot of good it did.
it's a decent system, but your locks are a joke.
anybody who knows the response time is going to be able to get in and out.
can you excuse me for one second, sir?
Yes.
what's going on? SEBASTIAN: It's about Briggs, Kyle's brother.
Yeah, and?
I don't know, hold on.
guys! Guys! How are we doing today?
is my office still going to be done last week?
you having a nice morning?
good!
Briggs got out of prison two months ago.
he hangs out at the Old Point Bar.
I'll pop over there after I'm done work and see if I can talk to him.
sorry about that, sir.
the cameras are nice and small, they'll fit right up there in the corner.
Oh, shit!
Chris Farraday, back from the dead, man! Yeah!
good to see you, man.
Oh, shit. This man was a world-class smuggler here.
you were fucking Houdini, man.
Yeah, he used to run with my brother, God rest his miserable soul.
too bad your skill didn't rub off on your shithead brother-in-law.
no, I know, he's a fuck-up.
Mmm. But he's my wife's little brother.
I was hoping you understand it's family, maybe we could work something out.
well, I don't know. What do you want to work out?
you want to work out something with me?
I can figure out a way to pay you back the buy money.
no, that's worth 700 grand to me.
Oh, come on, man. No, come on, man.
you're going to try to charge me full freight for a bad run?
customs boards the boat, you dump that shit. You know how it goes.
you know how many passes I gave your brother in his day?
Yeah, I hated my brother.
what do you want to do, a payment plan?
what, do I look like a bank to you?
no, I was just hoping you could be fucking reasonable, here.
Hey! This ain't your world anymore, man!
you're a tourist, you can't trade on status you don't have.
I got bills to pay.
you know, when people fuck that up, that's their fucking problem.
you think that's funny? You got bills?
I like your outfit.
I liked your brother.
man: We're here today, that's the important thing.
so, you know, learning to let go and let God is what's been pulling me through all of this.
you're going to have to talk me down before I fucking kill Briggs.
probably be better off.
I'm one drink away from the worst day of my life.
what should I do?
man: ...sitting in this circle that's had that same thought, right?
that's all you gotta do, is work the steps.
CHRIS: I'm not doing another run.
no fucking way.
I could probably get us the buy money, no problem.
no, I finally got something going.
I'm not going to chance fucking it up.
it's not going away, Chris.
man: Does somebody want to share?
Sebastian? Want to share a little bit with us?
okay. Oh, yeah.
go do your thing.
you don't want to stick around?
no, I get far too emotional hearing that story.
Hey, everyone, I'm Sebastian. ALL: How are you doing, Sebastian?
what the hell happened?
Walter died last night.
do me a favor, and don't tell Kate. Not until I'm gone.
when I stopped doing runs, you promised me you were gonna stay out of this shit.
what do you want me to say, man?
not a fucking word!
I didn't have anybody to tell me I was fucking up. You do!
and you put your sister and the boys in this shit?
what the fuck is wrong with you?
whoa.
you don't come to my fucking place.
I just came to tell you that I'm going to have your money within a month.
just stay away from Andy.
I ain't waiting that long.
well, I ain't paying if he's dead.
if a guy dies owing something,
so I'll give you two weeks.
if not, I'm going to come after the both of you.
then, all the way down the line.
I'll come asking your wife for it, your kids...
do you think you're the only guy with a fucking gun?
you'll get your fucking money.
but if you ever mention my wife and my kids again, you're done.
you hear me? You are fucking done!
girl: Daddy.
BRIGGS: It's okay, sweetie. Go back inside.
it's okay, sweetie. Daddy and I were just playing, okay?
it's okay. Yeah, we're just playing.
Yeah, me and Daddy were just fucking playing.
get up there.
Yeah, we'll play again.
daddy is okay.
it's all right.
what the fuck are you looking at?
CHRIS: You stay in the car, I'll go talk to her.
ANDY: Okay.
JEANIE: Hey, Chris. Hey, how are you?
Hi.
Hey.
everything okay?
Yeah, I just wanted to talk to you for a minute.
okay.
I got to get on the ship with Andy and try to fix this.
are you fucking kidding?
what am I going to do, let him go alone?
no, we're going to think of something else.
there's nothing else to do, okay?
I hate to tell you, but that little dumb fuck has put us in the worst possible position, okay?
and if they don't get the money from him, they're coming after us.
so what else do you want me to do?
you know what I don't want to do?
I don't want to fucking visit you in jail like we're visiting your dad, and raising those kids on my own.
so it's my...
I don't want to fight with you about this, okay?
I know what I'm doing, all right?
will you just trust me?
please?
nothing is going to happen.
all right? I promise. Mmm.
BUD: That shitbag Briggs was here for a couple of years.
he tried to smash some guy's head in with a cinder block.
look, I mentioned this to Sebastian.
we're doing another run.
can you get me on your old boat?
you mean the Borden?
remember when you were little, you and Sebastian, you broke into McTier's warehouse, stole all that Mardi Gras jewelry, and you came back to the house with a great big box of them beads?
you thought they were diamonds.
you were grinning like you just won the fucking lottery.
and you said, "You don't have to work on that boat no more.
I always think about that.
the proudest day of my life was when you turned legit, and you started your own business, and you got out of the life.
I know you got to do what you got to do.
I got it.
family is family.
I'll get you on the boat.
but you get in, you got to get back out.
CHRIS: Me and Andy are shipping out to Panama with the Borden.
SEBASTIAN: The old man's boat?
Yeah, he got us on.
what about Captain Camp?
I know. I know. Don't worry about it.
what's this?
what's what?
every time I come here, you got new shit.
I'm getting it together, I'm getting the place ready.
it's a bad-ass coffee table.
that is not for shoes.
I must be out of touch. I don't know what's bad-ass anymore because this looks cheap-ass.
you're turning into The Birdcage.
I mean...
so who do we know in Panama?
are you going to go see Ruben?
dude, no drugs.
what else has that kind of profit margin?
edwin is in Panama.
currency?
we have to bring back a shit-ton to make it worth our while.
all right, so I'll bring back a shit-ton.
okay, 15 million on four stacks this big.
it's like the size of a Mini Cooper.
where are you going to hide it?
that's my problem.
I need the Borden's crew manifest.
Oh, God. You got to be kidding me.
Oh, I like Tarik Mortin. He's a horrible chef, but he's great on runs.
le Cloud's a fucking drunk.
newlywed?
he's not great on runs, but we've known him a long time.
Olaf's solid, we need somebody in the engine room.
well, it's no A-Team, but it's the best we can do.
come on, work your magic. Make the call, get me a TWIC card.
Hi, sweet pea.
I need you to push through a TWIC card for Chris Farraday.
I got your message. It only took you three years to call me?
are you back in business?
no, no, no, no, no.
I need something, though.
remember our last run? The funny money?
I need that exact same shit by next week, but a lot more.
four times as much.
and we need a van big enough to transport it, okay?
okay. I'll be here.
come on, Mikey!
what's funny money?
huh? Nothing. That's just work stuff for Dad.
have you ever been convicted of espionage?
just answer yes or no, we'll get through this really quickly.
no.
sedition, or conspiracy to commit espionage, sedition, treason?
together?
I received your shipping application, Mr...
Mr. Lakowski.
senor Lakowski, I'm getting you a 20-foot standard dry.
would you like us to load it?
no, I've got somebody to take care of that. I just need the container.
okay, we'll leave the container standing by for you at the port of Panama.
and what are you shipping?
a van.
here you go.
it takes money to make money, baby.
thank you.
don't sink, Daddy.
okay, buddy.
you're going to miss my playoff game.
I know. I'm sorry.
your mom is going to take lots of pictures for me, okay?
you guys are in charge till I get back.
I love you, guys.
just come home, okay?
thank you for doing this, Chris.
I love you. Love you, too.
it's going to be okay.
ID, please. Finger on the scanner.
captain Camp. Get the trunk.
get that Captain's carpet cleaner up to the bridge.
LONGSHOREMAN: John, you want to give me a hand?
Hey!
you're up top. I get the bottom bunk.
Yeah, no kidding.
don't act like you don't like this shit.
why, is it that obvious?
I love it, but don't tell your sister.
all right, come on. You can get your beauty rest later, let's go.
my arm, my arm.
keep an eye out.
Hey, someone's coming.
man 1: What's up, Chris?
man 2: Hi, Chris.
Chris.
TARIK: Look at this motherfucker.
Olaf. Good to see you, man.
what's up, Tarik? You okay?
what's up, man?
how's your folks? Everybody's good? Good, good.
that's a hungry man's appetite.
this is real good.
how you doing, buddy?
what the fuck are you doing on my ship?
did you even check the goddamn crew manifest?
how the fuck do you let Bud Farraday's spawn aboard my ship?
DHS cleared him. He was added at the last minute.
all right, I'm demoting him to ship's boy.
Yes, sir.
camp: You scrub dirt and stay the fuck out of my sight.
otherwise you might have an accident, and wind up in the drink.
show him where the carpet cleaner is.
Yes, sir.
Danny: Oh, man, carpet cleaner.
let's go, Rug Doctor.
Oh, you got promoted? They gave you some new stripes on there.
I'll be ship's boy. You're still Captain's bitch boy.
Yeah, yeah.
okay.
Yes, sir.
everybody's drinking tall boys, and nobody's fucking working.
TARIK: What's up, man?
are you bringing the Captain in on this or what?
fuck, no.
well, I remember talking to your pops in this same room.
he said that same shit. We know how that turned out.
do you trust me or not?
I do. I do.
so what are we running?
a shipping pallet loaded up with 5, 000 uncut sheets of super notes.
best counterfeit money can buy.
and just how the hell do you think we're going to stow that much shit?
you worried, buddy? I mean, where is the faith?
what, I lost my stripes? Now I got to start from scratch?
Danny: Exactly, that shit's void.
no problem.
come on, I'll show you.
CHRIS: What do you think?
looks good. Chris, you're a crazy fucker.
not bad? Huh? Sixty cubic feet.
no fucking way. No, it's bigger than 60.
Ah, shit! Yeah, man, this is much bigger than 60.
we got company.
quick, quick, quick!
ANDY: Hey, what are you doing? Chris, stop!
CHRIS: Andy, be quiet in there.
come on, come on!
what the hell are you doing in here?
I needed a scraper. We noticed some mold in the lower hull.
the bleach wasn't cutting it, so...
well, you shouldn't be dicking around in here. Get going.
I was just trying to keep it clean for you, boss.
Hey, Chris! Chris!
CHRIS: Bring it right back up! Come on, you got it!
you got it, come on!
I can't do it.
TARIK: God damn.
are you getting on?
no.
do you want me to put you back in the box?
that's not funny.
I could have suffocated in that box.
I really could have...
leave the kid alone, man.
how are you going to pull this shit off?
we're delivering 300 or so containers. Yeah.
we're picking up 500 or more. We're not going to be in port that long.
so we got to drive out to Chorrillo, see Edwin, load up the bills, and then drive back to the boat during rush hour.
it's going to be tight, but we're going to be good.
it's going to be too tight. We're cutting it close.
might not have enough time.
we'll buy more time.
controllable pitch propeller.
Oh, yeah. Pitch propeller.
can you drain the oil supply?
the hydraulic chamber won't work.
that's the point, stupid ass.
CHRIS: Look.
we can do it while being towed through the locks.
it will buy us a couple of hours.
okay? I don't know.
I hate when we fuck with the boat.
what?
I said, I hate when we fuck with the boat.
CHRIS: Take it easy, big bear.
Olaf, fuck with the boat.
take it easy. Easy.
what the fuck?
Tarik. That motherfucker will eat you.
okay, out you come.
do you want to get any of these for me? Do we have to?
Yes, Mom.
yeah? Okay.
Kate: Hello?
can I help you?
you're pretty.
do you want to play?
okay. Bye, asshole.
BRIGGS: Pay the money, just like you owe me.
DESMOND: What the fuck are you all looking at?
BRIGGS: Yeah, you like that?
Kate: Get your fucking hands off me!
BRIGGS: Come on, put the knife down. Put the knife down.
put the knife down.
leave my mommy alone!
get the fuck back over there! Sit your fucking ass down!
it's okay, I'm just playing, now.
I'm just playing.
Yeah, don't cry.
DESMOND: You seen a gun before? You want it?
there ain't going to be no playing when I come back next week.
you can tell your husband that.
you want this? Get out!
No! MARCUS: What the fuck?
get the fuck out of my house! Get the fuck out of my house!
put that thing down, man!
you don't think the police are going to be coming now?
get the fuck out of here!
DESMOND: I didn't mean to shoot at him. The little shit hit the gun.
you want to send me back to the farm, you stupid bitch?
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.
all right, careful. Not too much.
we don't want to jam it. I got it.
chief MATE ON RADIO: Chris Farraday, to the bridge.
here.
he's on his way.
not too much.
Danny: All right.
Kate: I wasn't getting reception on your cell.
Chris, these guys came to the house. They had guns.
Jesus, are you okay? Are the boys okay?
Yeah, we're okay. We're freaked out.
I think one of them was Tim Briggs, Kyle's brother.
I didn't call the police, I don't want them here asking questions.
call Sebastian, okay?
Yeah, okay, I will.
all right, I love you. Call him.
trouble with the missus, Farraday?
do you want me to talk to her for you?
SEBASTIAN: Hey, guys, you okay? You had a scary day?
both: Mmm-hmm.
you know what? Why don't you guys just come and stay at my place?
they're not going to be back, but just for my own peace of mind.
you think?
Really? Okay.
camp: Slow ahead.
I said, slow ahead! Reduce to half speed!
why are we not slowing down?
oil pressure's down.
crew MEMBER: All right. Keep an eye on that temperature.
full astern!
chief MATE: Full astern, Captain.
Yeah, Captain? Full astern!
we're going to hit the fucking dock!
I'm trying, but I got no pitch control. The fucking prop is jammed!
you drained too much oil out! I didn't want you to crash the boat!
what?
olaf: Come on! I'm not getting any oil pressure!
let go the port anchor!
Jesus, fucking...
let go the fucking port anchor!
it's not moving! DANNY: Did you release the brake?
get out of the way! Move!
turn starboard!
camp: It's too late! Hard to port, Luke! Hard to port!
olaf: I'm going to have to kill the engine!
fucking...
we're going to hit!
what the fuck is going on around here?
what the fuck happened?
propeller jam.
someone tampered with it.
I don't think so.
someone tampered with it.
sorry about that oil thing.
don't worry about it.
it will buy us a little more time.
EDDIE: Hey, Michael, look. It's like a spaceship over here.
wow, Sebastian, it's amazing in here.
yeah? It's coming along, right?
I forgot you haven't been here since the renovation.
Hey, don't touch that.
fellas, you hang on to this.
okay, that's good.
good aim.
CHRIS: Hey, everything okay?
Kate: Yeah we're at Sebastian's.
are the boys okay?
Yeah. Are you in Panama already?
Yeah. Keep your phone on you.
I love you.
I love you, too. I'll call you on my way back.
we're almost there.
EDWIN: Hey! Whoa!
you got a lot of pussy in here.
good to see you, man.
everything good? Yeah.
good, you got the cash, the van?
Si, si. Cool.
Yeah.
Danny: Whoa.
what, you don't trust me?
Oh, I trust you.
esta bueno?
no, it's no fucking bueno.
Andy, wait here. Danny, come on.
Hey, what is it? What are you doing?
I need some iodine.
the ink is OVI, the layers are right, but that paper felt different.
Hey, quepasa? What's going on?
you better hope I'm wrong.
you fucking idiots didn't print this on starch-free paper.
I'm sorry, man. This is the best I have.
I don't have time for this.
I told you on the phone,
I needed exactly what you sold me last time.
Gonzalo. Gonzalo has it at the warehouse.
Gonzalo? That little shithead who works for Jesus?
no. There's no more Jesus.
Gonzalo is running things now.
why didn't you send me to him in the first place?
are you fucking playing games with me? Are you fucking playing...
I tried! But he doesn't want anybody going there!
no, no, no.
we're going to the warehouse. Let's go.
no, no, no, no, no.
Chris.
EDWIN: Hey, Chris, man, look, take the van, man. I'm sorry.
Kate: Come on, Mikey!
man, the sun's really killing me.
that kid is big. He is. Number 11 is a big kid.
hold on, I got to take this.
okay.
Hey, man, what's up?
he didn't have them.
all right.
well, I guess you're going to have to bring in some candy.
I'm not bringing in drugs.
just go and see Ruben.
I told you, I'm not bringing in drugs. Okay. It's not an option.
Chris, Chris, Chris, I'm begging you. Please.
Chris? Yeah, Chris?
put him in the fucking van.
you know, you come back empty-handed,
Andy's going to get fucking hit, and you're still gonna have to come up with the goddamn money.
look, I'll figure it out, okay?
just keep Briggs away from my family, please.
Yeah, of course.
Hey, I got a little problem at work I got to take care of.
see you later, buddy.
Bye, Sebastian. Everything okay?
Yeah, everything's fine. You got your key?
Yeah.
I'm telling you, man. Stay away from Gonzalo.
he's been acting crazy lately, since he became a boss.
stay away from him.
Danny: Chris, we should have listened to him.
we got less than an hour to get back to the boat. It ain't going to work.
it will work.
I mean, do you even know where Gonzalo's warehouse is?
we're in fucking Chorrillo right now.
I'm looking for something to remind me.
we're going to find it.
here we go. Here we go. Look, right here! Here!
camp: Mortin. Yeah, Cap?
where the hell is Farraday?
I don't know, Cap.
I didn't know I had to babysit him today. I didn't get the memo.
don't piss me off, Mortin.
you'll be flipping shit-burgers at McDonald's before you can say "minimum wage.
I'm sorry, Cap. Sorry.
that little visit you paid Kate, the kids, Chris' family?
that's my family.
you stay away from them. Are we clear?
Hi, Sadie.
Hi.
you know, if you had hired a real smuggler instead of Andy, our package would have come in when it was supposed to.
you know, I'm really sorry about that.
do you know how fucked up things are for me right now?
I know. He said he knew what he was doing.
I didn't know he was his brother-in-law.
Danny: Hey, man, this is way more high-risk than I originally anticipated.
I got a wife now. I like my wife.
Yeah, I got a wife, too, okay?
and don't worry about Gonzalo.
I know him, he's a little fucking punk. Don't worry about it.
Oh, yeah? I heard stories about this dude cutting people's heads off and shit.
I'm looking for Gonzalo.
Andy, stay in the van with the bag.
Danny, it's all good. I know this guy, come on.
VOICEMAIL: You have one new message.
BRIGGS: Hey, fuckhead, I'm watching your sister's kid play soccer.
you don't call me back,
I'm gonna walk out on that field and put a bullet in his head.
Chris.
ANDY: Don't... Stop talking.
like I said, I want you to take the buy money and go to that address, and talk to a gentleman named Ruben.
if you ever want to see your little nephew again, you take the package and you bring it back, all right?
Danny: Hey, is that a wolf?
that ain't no fucking dog.
excuse me, senor. Do you mind?
where is he?
where is my old friend Farraday?
bring the van around.
sorry for showing up unannounced.
edwin was trying to play games with me.
Where's my buddy Jesus?
we fed him to the wolves.

I am the new Jesus, cabron.
it's good to see you.
you, too.

Andy?
Andy!
Oh, fuck.

Michael: He charges...
Michael, not in the house. We're guests.
look at young Daddy.
Michael: He shoots!
he scores!
go find your mom.
you ain't fucking around, huh? Looks like you're ready for anything.
are you going to war or something?
I told you. We're taking down a truck. Fucking rock and roll.
CHRIS: No shit. You got all these guys.
what the fuck is in that truck, man?
you want to know?
then maybe you should show these assholes how it's done.
no, look...
I'll give you the super notes for free.
Yeah, thanks anyway. But I got a boat to catch, so...
come on. Don't tell me you don't miss this shit.
I got two kids now, man, you know? My cowboy days are over.
come on, Danny!
the money's gone.
and Andy.

what the fuck are you talking about?
you come in here and treat me like an asshole?
no, primo, I wouldn't do that, man.
I should fucking blow your brains out.
does that offer still stand?
we ride with you, I get the super notes for free?
Yeah, there's something you can do for us.
grab their wallets.
give him your wallet.
give me their IDs.
we're being fined every minute longer we sit here, Captain.
Yep.
we got to take that...
captain. CAMP: What's the status?
pitch propeller overheated. It needs oil. We're working on it.
you got 10 minutes!
it's Olaf.
Chris, you have got 10 minutes.
that's not long enough.
have Tarik delay the loading.
just stall them for as long as you can, okay?
get here. I'll do what I can.
see, Chris? This is exactly what I didn't want to happen.
exactly.
I mean, what are we supposed to be doing here?
blocking the truck.
right. That's awesome.
we're blocking the truck.
like human speed bumps.
tell my wife that...
will you shut the fuck up?
look, we're going to get through this, okay?
I'm not telling your wife shit!
gonzalo: Okay, ready. They're coming.
CHRIS: Put your seatbelt on.
he's coming down. Here we go.

Danny: Is he going to slow down?
CHRIS: Yeah, he's going to slow down.
you said he's going to slow down! He's gonna slow down.
he's not slowing down!
shit!

are you all right?
Oh, my God.
CHRIS: Oh, fuck!

Danny, are you okay?
I need you to hold containers D, E and F, until I say so.
I'm going to pay you $100, yeah?

Oh, shit. Danny, help.

if he's fucking dead, throw him out the van.
wait, wait! Get our IDs!

toss him out!
okay, boys, let's warm her up.
Danny: How much time do you think we have?
CHRIS: No time.
second MATE ON RADIO: Get those containers aboard or we're leaving without them.
TARIK: Chris, where the fuck are you, man? The ship's leaving.
CHRIS: Just hold the ship, we're coming.
just get your ass over here!
all right.
any crew member hasn't come aboard yet, you make sure they get searched before you let them on, you got me?
all right, come on, it's going to open up.
Danny: Are we going to make it?
Yeah, he's holding the container for us.
come on. Go, go, go!
CHRIS: I'm coming. Open the container.
when you come to let us out, bring something to clean up a bit of a mess.

Hey, where are you going?
I just stowed some decent beef.
Ooh! Thank God.

Yeah, you would know.
DECKHAND: Fuck you, Tarik.

CHRIS: You got the cleaning stuff? Yeah.

I need to tell you...
are you out of your fucking mind?
are you fucking crazy?
Where's the money? Where is it?
it's gone! I had to use it.
it's what? Where's the money?
what are you trying to...
what did you just say to me?
I had to use it.
you what?
I had to use it.
it's in the ceiling.
no, you fucking...
how fucking stupid are you?
I came out here to help you, to risk my fucking freedom and my wife and my children for this?
motherfucker.
what the fuck am I supposed to do with all that?
you got to be the dumbest motherfucker...
he said he was going to kill Michael.
CHRIS: What?
VOICEMAIL: You have one saved message.
BRIGGS: Hey, fuckhead, I'm watching your sister's kid play soccer.
you don't call me back,
I'm gonna walk out on that field and put a bullet in his head.
get the bag.
are you all right? Yeah.
you all right? You all right?
Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.
I'm sorry. Calm down, calm down.
Chris. CHRIS: Hey.
everything okay? Boys all right?
Yeah, they're sleeping.
what's up? Is everything okay? Is Andy okay?
Yeah. Don't worry about it. Is Sebastian there?
Kate: Yeah, he is. Do you want me to get him for you?
no, no.
no, it's okay. Go back to sleep.
I'll call you in the morning.
Kate: Okay. I love you.
I love you, too.
SEBASTIAN: Chris?
Chris, I've been trying to call you. What's going on?
Andy picked something up.
Really? I thought we weren't doing that.
I didn't have a choice.
thank God for Andy taking the initiative, though, huh?
too bad I'm not bringing it in.
I'm thinking of dumping it in the sea, actually.
why would you do that?
then we would all be fucked!
take it on faith.
I need to talk to you.
SEBASTIAN: Is something wrong?
I told you I would call you with an update.
you've got a few more days left before I cut your head off and stick it up your ass.
and you're asking me, "Is there anything wrong?
well, I got something coming in.
you don't sound so sure.
I'm sure. It's coming in.
flying solo ain't for sidekicks, Abney.
I fucking warned you.
when you first came to me for help in keeping your little business afloat,
I fucking warned you.
I said, "You've got to know your limitations.
don't live beyond your fucking means!
I don't normally do this fucking shit.
telling you what's going to happen when you don't pay.
what's the fucking point? You know the rules, right?
right.
you take care, Abney.
Jack, neat.
somebody's off the wagon.
I want you to go see Kate.
man, I thought she was your family.
you know, if you want to fuck his wife, you fuck his wife.
but don't waste my time so you can play hero.
Chris is falling apart out there.
he's going to dump the package.
don't touch her. Just get her attention.
all right.
Yeah.
Oh, man.
do you think it's going to work?
it's going to work. You think so?
did you take science in school, Tarik?
Yeah.
then you should know salt dissolves in water, bitch.
are you leaving soon?
Yeah, Sebastian is dropping the boys off.
we're going home.
Oh, that's right. Chris is coming home.
Yeah.
so, you'll be all smiles in the morning?
I hope so.
you get out of here, I got it.
good night.
good night. Good night, baby.
I'll lock the door.
Thanks.
Oh, my God!
get the fuck away from me!
my friend will be here, he'll kick your...
I'm going to be perfectly fucking clear.
you call your husband and you tell him not to dump it in the water!
you tell him that you, Michael and Eddie are all depending on him.
do you understand me?
do you understand me?
stay away from my kids!
he's got a gun!
Whoa! What are you doing?
Hey.
are you all right?
honey, I want you to get in the truck with me.
the kids are inside, all right?
you smell like alcohol.
Yeah, I had a drink.
you're driving my kids around drunk? Are you fucking kidding me?
relax. What did he say to you?
come on, get out. We're going in my car. Let's go.
SEBASTIAN: Kate! Guys, get back in the car.
Kate, what are you doing?
Kate! Kate! Get in the truck.
fuck.
Kate ON PHONE: He knew the kids' names.
hold on, you're breaking up, okay? Let me go outside.
Oh, fuck.
cell service sucks here on the river. Hold on, I'm going outside.
Hello? He told me to tell you...
no, hold on. I can't hear you.
he told me to tell you not to dump it in...
Chris, please come home.
Chris?
Chris?
Hey, how did it go?
we boarded up the front window.
the cops took a report. They're looking for the guy.
all right.
they want to talk to you.
Yeah. I'm going to go by in the morning.
they want to talk to you now.
but we have no stuff. I've got to go to Sebastian's to get our stuff.
would you mind watching the boys for a second?
look at your forehead.
are you sure you don't need me to take you to the hospital?
no, it's just... It looks worse than it is.
it just hurts. Like a bruise, you know?
I think I should go now before I can't. You know what I mean?
I'll see you in a little bit.
goodbye, Mom. I love you.
be good boys.
Sebastian?
did you tell Briggs I was going to dump it?
no. I didn't tell nobody.
don't lie to me.
Chris, I'm not fucking lying to you. I didn't say shit.
where did you get the drugs?
from a guy called Ruben.
Kate: Sebastian?
Hey.
Hi. I'm just getting our stuff.
are you hungry? Let me make you some food.
no, I can't.
the boat's not coming in. I got to get back to the boys.
Chris will be back tonight.
no, he's not. He's not coming home tonight.
I mean, the boat's not coming in for, like, I don't know, tomorrow.
Chris told me that I had to take care of you, so I'm going to take care of you.
Sebastian, are you not hearing me? We'll be fine, okay?
Yeah, we're fine.
okay, good. All right. Good.
give me a hug.
okay. Okay.
it's been such a big day.
what the fuck are you doing?
nothing. I'm not doing anything.
I'm trying to give my friend a fucking kiss. What's your problem?
what's your problem? Kate, come on.
look, I mean, did you even see this?
stop it.
Kate.
how long have we known each other?
you know what? Get your hands off me!
Kate? Kate!
leave me the fuck alone!
SEBASTIAN: Kate!
Kate!
Jesus Christ. Kate!
I'm trying to have a conversation with you, and you're acting like a fucking child.
okay. Good. Why don't you just walk away from the door, and let me get out of here.
an ungrateful child. A little fucking brat, who's not grateful for...
do you want to talk to Chris about what a fucking bitch I am?
I'm going to fucking call him on the phone right now!
don't call Chris.
sweetheart, I love you, but open the door.
I'm calling Chris!
don't mess with his head now!
why don't you fucking tell him?
shit!
honey, I'm sorry. Are you okay?
Kate?
Kate, it's not funny. Stop fucking around.
fuck.
you're going to be okay. You're going to be okay.
shit.
Kate?
Kate! Kate!
Hey.
I know what you did.
I know Briggs works for you.
you stay the fuck away from my family, or I'm going to kill you.
you hear me?
just bring in the package. Everything's going to be fine.
I'm not bringing in shit.
you'll never see that fucking package.
you know, I didn't know about...
I can't believe you. You fucking played me.
I'm not playing you.
I'm coming. I'm coming for you.
okay.
captain Camp.
Sebastian.
what do you want, Abney?
Chris Farraday is running shit.
okay.
he's going to dump the package.
if you make sure he doesn't, I will give you his share.
Jesus, Abney. You are one cold rat bastard.
all right.
but if Farraday don't give it up,
I'm going to call in the dogs, and your package is getting seized.
no, he'll tell you where it is. He won't risk doing time.
camp: Next time you want to run shit on my ship, you do it right and pay a fare like everybody else.
camp: Where is it? Where's what?
you're running something. I know you're running something.
I'm not running anything, Captain.
you want to play that way? Check.
this is your one chance.
you give it up now, or you want me to call CBP?
I'm not running anything.
your wife asked me to bring some Panamanian dog shit home for her to eat and rub in her fucking cunt...
fuck you, you piece of shit. But I didn't have time.
you dumb-ass motherfucker! This is how you want it?
Yeah, this is how I want it.
you want to go down just like your dumb-ass daddy, you piece of shit mick?
fuck this.
you made it now, motherfucker.
right?
whatever it is, CBP is going to find it.
Yeah, he's in the cafeteria.
you're clear.
come on, come on.
shit! Pick up the phone, buddy.
customs and Border Protection, Port of New Orleans.
it's Redmond, line two.
Redmond.
Yeah, John, I've got a good tip.
somebody's making a run on my ship.
Really?
all right, listen up, guys and gals,
I want an interdiction team ready for deployment in 20 minutes.
let's go.
male DISPATCHER: Flight 104, copy that. Three minutes to contact.
ready. Standing by.
holy shit!
well, it was good while it lasted.
who the fuck called the cavalry in?
second MATE: Inspection, please!
all crew. Everybody.
who's in here?
welcome aboard.
all right, gentlemen, sit down.
what the fuck is going on?
Larry, check the ceiling.
take it down.
Wow! Look at this.
CBP OFFICER: There's nothing in there.
there's nothing in there?
shit!
second MATE: That's enough.
a tarp.
tool box with nothing in it.
you said you thought it smelled funny, right?
Yes, Captain.
maybe it's just been cleaned. That's about it.
could be covering up something, maybe?
could be.
second MATE: Watch your step.
just put the carpet cleaner in the trunk.
you got it?
just put it right there, that's fine.
fuck.
Oh, shit.
davis: The van in D-7.
what about it?
we're taking it apart now.
but you can just save us the trouble, and tell us what's in it.
I would love to help you, but I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
do you think we're stupid?
LAIRD: And who is Jib Lakowski?
it says right there, he's the guy shipping the van, so maybe you should talk to him.
he died in 2004.
then I guess he's not going to need the van. Huh?
what's up, Houdini?
you got something for me?
what are you talking about?
come on, man. Just give it to him.
what the fuck are you talking about?
come on, man!
Yeah, I didn't think so. Say goodbye to Andy.
Chris! Chris! MARCUS: Shut the fuck up!
ANDY: Don't fuck me, man!
what are you doing?
ANDY: Chris!

pull the fucking trigger!
you don't get your dope if I'm dead.

this is it right here.
right here?
Yeah.
what, you got your grandma selling cocaine?
it's my friend's place.
BRIGGS: You better not be messing around,
I'll put a bullet in your face.
CHRIS: All right, take it easy. Come on.
DESMOND: Is your friend home? CHRIS: Quiet.
trust me, you don't want to wake this fucker up.
male DISPATCHER: One, state your position, please.
211, responding.
we have a home security alarm triggered at 452 King Drive.
BRIGGS: Hey, you got some rich friends, man.
come on.

Whoo! That's some world-class smuggling right there, man.
Yeah!
MARCUS: We got it now, man.
check this out.
this is the shit, man.
check this out.
Yeah.
Oh, that's some real booger-sugar right there.
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.
it's good?
Yeah, yeah.
great. I'm going to take a piss,
I've been holding it since I got off the boat.
all right, you do that.
it doesn't want to come out, man.
they make it stubborn...
who the hell are you?
what the fuck are you doing in my goddamn house?
BRIGGS: Go back to bed, old man.
MARCUS: Shit, it's Five-O!
get the fuck out! Pack that shit up, man.
Jeanie, is Kate there? She's not picking up her phone.
are the boys with you?
Yeah, the boys are here. She left a while ago.
said she was going to Sebastian's to get their stuff.
listen, if she calls you, tell her to call me right away.
camp: Absolutely fucking ridiculous.
I've never seen these idiots before in my life.
that one dumbshit right there is bleeding all over my couch, and they're cutting up their drugs.
CHRIS: Kate?
Kate!
Sebastian!
I want you guys to pour the cement on the south corner first.
can we start on the south corner first?
woman ON RADIO: We're set up for the other side. No, we can't.
south corner first, hurry the hell up.
you guys have milked this fucking job long enough!
hold it!
man: We're pouring over on the south corner. Take it over there.
what the hell's going on here? I thought we were doing the other side.
why are you moving the cement truck?
you're blocking the fucking trucks.
you send guys to my house?
huh? I trusted you with my wife and my kids.
and I fucking loved you like a brother.
where is Kate?
where the fuck is Kate?
one more fucking time. Where's Kate?
she's gone.
are you okay, Seb?
man: Whose phone is this?

Chris?
Oh, my God!

Oh, fuck.

man: Yeah, I need an ambulance...
CHRIS: Oh, shit.

Yeah.
these are the coordinates Chris gave me when he dropped it.
we're definitely in the right place.
Chris.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I got that. And you got one.

Danny: Oh!
Yeah!
Danny: Oh, man! I can't believe it.

CHRIS: I'm not taking any less than three.
okay, three.

so you were down in Panama, were you?
Yeah.
did you hear about that famous painting by Jackson Pollock?
it got ripped off in Panama.
come on, it's been all over the news.
no. No idea.
what's that thing worth, anyway?
about 140 million.

you tell them. They have a right to know.
what? What?
it's just a setback.
Betty.
what am I gonna do, Abra?
give up? Is that what you're saying?
it's gone. They looked?
can't they look again? They did.
mistakes happen.
obviously, or Kenny wouldn't be in prison.
Betty, they destroyed it.
no.
that evidence exists somewhere and I'm gonna find it.
okay. Let's say you do find it.
what if the DNA matches Kenny's?
get out. Get the hell out of my house right now!
no, you gotta hear this.
even if you're the most amazing fighter, the most brilliant lawyer in the world, there are forces greater than you and you may not win!
you think I haven't thought of that?
no. You haven't.
just go.
sorry, boys.
it's just a setback.
eat your food. Come on.
good morning.
can I help you? Yeah.
I'm an attorney, Abra Rice, and I'm trying to locate evidence from the Kenneth Waters trial.
Yeah, we spoke on the phone.
did you check with the courthouse?
Yeah, and they can't locate it.
Yeah, well, like I said, they probably destroyed it by now.
I mean, it's been, like, what...
Betty Anne Waters?
you know, I'm sorry, I don't...
lieutenant Daniels.
I knew your brother Kenny.
I was a rookie here when...
you're his sister?
but I am an attorney, and he is my client.
holy shit!
my sister won't even send me a birthday card!
I was just telling Ms. Waters that we don't have any evidence here.
here? From back then?
that's a lot of years.
would you mind looking?
you're really his lawyer, huh?
Yeah.
that's it for the old evidence.
and there's nowhere else?
that's it, just supplies.
working hard for your brother. I wish I had better news for you.
how's Kenny holding up?
not so great.
I remember that case.
funny guy, that Kenny. I gotta tell ya, even with what he did... He didn't do it.
I liked Kenny. We all liked him.
Nancy Taylor didn't.
Yeah, well, Nancy Taylor doesn't work here anymore.
why not?
she got herself into a little hot water.
Groton Police Department. Chief O'Connell's office.
no. He's not available right now, sir.
I gave him your message.
I understand.
I will let him know.
why aren't you a cop anymore?
I left the force when I got married.
Really? You mean it had nothing to do with you framing another cop?
I beg your pardon?
what was his name? Oh, yeah, Stanley Randall.
he found out that you were dirty, so you got a waitress from the Rusty Scupper to accuse him of rape.
is that what they told you over in Ayer?
I'm sure you can imagine what it was like to be the only woman on that police force. Hmm?
I wasn't dirty, and the rape charge wasn't false.
the truth is, they never got over me solving the Brow murder.
you didn't solve it. You put an innocent man in prison.
I am sorry you have wasted your life on this.
your brother killed that woman.
Hi, Don.
Hi, Betty.
is she sleeping?
she usually is at 5: 00 in the morning.
come on in. I'll get her up.
Thanks.
baby, sweetheart. Guess who?
I wish we could use this. I mean, she framed a cop, for Chrissakes.
it still doesn't prove she framed Kenny,
I mean, it wouldn't be enough.
thank you.
no. it's not enough for a new trial.
God, I hate the damn legal system. it's so fucking inconvenient.
I'm sorry I kicked you out of my house.
it's okay. Your mac and cheese sucks.
you were wearing that outfit when you said you were me?
Yeah. Too bad being you didn't get me anywhere.
you know, there is one thing we haven't tried yet.
how long will it take you to make yourself look like a lawyer?
Hi. I'm attorney Abra Rice and this is my associate.
I'd like to talk to Mrs. Halloran.
do you have an appointment?
it's a pressing legal matter. Mrs. Halloran's aware of it.
I'm Mrs. Halloran.
hello. I'm Abra Rice, we spoke earlier.
Yes, but as I told you on the phone...
I'm Betty Anne Waters.
and the evidence in question is from my brother's trial.
I'm also his attorney, and I became an attorney just to help him.
I understand that you looked, but if you could please just look one more time.
if we did this for every person who came in here...
we don't have the Staff.
look, I don't know what else to do but beg.
I'm asking for a favor, a favor from a complete stranger, but, please.
you're talking about evidence that's 16 years old.
our record shows it was destroyed.
is it possible that the record could be wrong?
that's highly unlikely.
but possible.
are those your grand kids?
Yes. Beautiful.
they look like you.
please.
my brother's innocent. And you're right, it's been 16 years.
and our family really wants him home.
she's there.
why don't we come back here?
just set it right there.
thank you. It's okay,
here you go.
you're allowed to touch.
14B.
victim's blood.
number 29?
victim.
exhibit es, A through F.
perpetrator.
good job, counselor.
I'll need to file a motion to preserve the evidence.
well, that office is closed now, but I'll file it for you in the morning.
I'll get you the paperwork.
you're gonna...You're just gonna leave the box out on the table?
it'll be fine.
my brother's life is in there. Please.
could I just put a sign on it with my name?
that really isn't necessary. Please.
if anything happens to this...
well, all right.
okay. Thank you. Yeah.
could I borrow some tape?
it's right over there.
okay. Here you go.
thank you.
all right.
okay.
you missed a spot.
he's getting out of here!
shit.
hello.
is this Betty Anne Waters? Yes.
this is Barry Scheck.
Oh, my God. Hi.
Hi.
how are you?
fine, fine! Great!
congratulations on finding the evidence.
it's extraordinary.
thank you, but I really didn't do anything.
you mean, besides becoming a lawyer?
no, I mean, you know, we were just lucky that the box was still there.
I hear you beat up an old lady to find it.
no, but that was gonna be my next step.
Kenny thinks he's getting out tomorrow.
I wish.
das don't like to admit they put an innocent person in prison.
and this DA, Martha Coakley, has just gotten elected, so she's really not gonna like it.
how long do you think it's gonna take?
we're gonna have some hoops to go through, it might be a couple of months.
a couple of months?
it may be less.
but the important thing is, if your brother's innocent...
he is.
then this is a travesty of justice, and we will get him out.
thank you, Barry. Thank you. Thank you so much for calling.
no hugging.
I'm his sister!
he's in segregation. And that's the rules.
let's go.
Thanks, Dad.
