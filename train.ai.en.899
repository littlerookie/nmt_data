he has good instincts. He'll be fine.
look, I know it's been hard for you, not being out there yourself, but you'll be cleared for action soon.
in the meantime, maybe find another punching bag?
this isn't personal.
it's about making sure Owen's ready.
ready for what?
look, you know as well as I do when you're out there, things can turn on a dime.
and when that happens, you need to have absolute trust in the skills of the person who has your back.
and I know Owen can be that guy.
good, because I can't.
Nikita, I'm not going back into the field.
this--this may be good enough for someone who wants to drive again, or use a fork and knife in a restaurant, but for what we do, it is not good enough.
it is nowhere near good enough.
you're just frustrated. - No. Actually, no.
this is not frustration.
things have changed... and I accept that.
but it is why I need to make sure Owen is ready for this job.
he's your partner now.
Birkhoff, there has to be something better.
what? - Michael's hand.
that's some kind of training model, right?
something to get him used to the system until
I don't know. Something better?
there is no better.
that's it.
look, Michael came to me with the same question.
I had to give him the same answer.
now, he didn't like it, but he accepted it.
maybe you should, too.
SEARCHING"HEDECKER"
Hey, it's okay.
come on. Come on.
did you build this?
started it the day I got free of my government commitment.
I cleared out a space for you, over here.
no phones, no computers.
Oh, don't wander outside.
I set up some--some deterrents.
don't want anybody sticking their noses in our business, right?
I'll show you where they are later on, so you can walk around, but...
I got to take care of some stuff. - No!
the other kidnapped women, what happened to them?
they haven't been found yet.
is there a pattern with the victims?
well, his profile suggests that he's trying to regain something that he lost a long time ago.
why do people always have so much trouble letting go of the past?
because it reminds them of better times?
not always. Kate...
she went through a horrible experience with Ray, and it haunts her. She couldn't let it go.
I should have helped her.
sometimes, no matter how much you want to help someone, you just can't.
come on. Time to go.
the troopers are clearing the first zone now.
Where's Sean's team?
sweeping the area closer to the cell tower.
punji trap. He's set booby traps.
tell Nikita to be careful. - Hey, guys, the target left behind a few unwanted presents for us.
keep your eyes peeled. - Copy.
division.
all units be advised.
central command has designated current search-and-rescue a closed operation.
only official PSP personnel have ground clearance.
what about the FBI already on the case?
command is unaware of any authorized federal agents.
can I see that map again?
Hey, what field office did you say you were from?
Philly. - Right.
and who's the-- who's the S.A.C. over there?
do you know people at the Bureau?
Oh, yeah. A few.
I'm on it.
the Special Agent in charge in Philadelphia is...
well, I will tell Javi that you said "hello."
you know, I think there's something to be learned from those past kidnappings.
why don't we go back to hq and you can show me those case files?
that's a good idea, although I don't think we have time for that right now.
I think we do.
come on!
ops? Nikita. We're clear.
what the hell happened?
we were blown. We had to get out of there.
no, from what I could tell, you were doing fine until Owen started decking cops. There was a situation.
that we were defusing. - It wasn't working.
I had to make a move.
Michael, it was the right call.
Yeah, well, you're dead to the cops now, and Ray's on alert.
now get back here so we can sort out this mess.
if he doesn't get off my case, I'm gonna take his other hand.
just, believe me, he's thinking about you.
Yeah, I know exactly what he's thinking of me.
no, I mean he's hard on you for a reason.
he wants you to be good enough for me.
he's not coming back, Owen.
not to field work.
he says you're my partner now, for good, and he wants you to be ready for that.
he's trying to do the right thing.
all he's doing is leaving behind his life as an agent. That's it.
what if that's not all he's leaving behind?
I can't look at another tree.
this must be what squirrels feel like.
he's got to have a structure in there, even if it's just a tent.
Yeah, but this guy's whole mojo is about making himself invisible, and if he had time to set those traps, you know he took his time hiding his base.
Yeah, but how much time?
Birkhoff, can you call up a satellite image of the forest from six months ago?
okay, now can your imaging software look for any changes in the terrain?
there was a clearing in the northwest corner.
not there anymore. It's all trees now.
what kind of trees grow like that in six months?
camouflage.
Birkhoff, send the coordinates to Sean.
Nikita, we have a possible bearing on Ray's base.
can you and Owen turn around and meet up with Sean?
we're almost there.
you are? I told you to return home.
we're better prepped on Ray's profile than the other team, and they're undermanned for that search area, so I changed the call.
sometimes you got to do that out here in the field.
let me know when you find Sean.
bastard.
what have we got?
some kind of bunker over that rise.
seen Ray?
no. No sign of the girl, either.
Sean, Owen. Owen, Sean.
you know, from what I'd heard, I thought you'd be bigger.
Really?
I didn't know what you'd look like, because, well, nobody ever talks about you.
all right, let's move on. Where's your team?
far side, covering the flank.
red one, get me recon.
I lost Jensen. - We lost Jensen's signal.
checking.
Nikita, you're under attack.
I repeat, you are under attack!
red three, meet me at the previous waypoint.
eyes on the bunker.
wait, stop! Don't move!
No!
agents down!
Oh, come on.
you okay?
your armor caught it. Can you move?
Yeah.
Owen's wounded, but mobile.
we're heading for Sean.
dead.
Sean's alive, but he needs medical attention.
okay, we can airlift him out of there in 1/2 hour.
but there's another problem. We heard police chatter.
they heard the explosion, and they're on their way.
I'll go after Ray.
look, you can't even take a deep breath.
you're staying with Sean. Take cover.
I'll go after Ray. - Not by yourself.
if you hadn't noticed, he just kicked our ass.
he took us by surprise.
Nikita- -Look, you want to have my back?
watch out for the people I care about.
that includes you.
okay.
Kate. Kate, wake up.
Where's Ray? - Who are you?
I'm here to help, but I need to know where Ray is.
I don't know. I don't know.
I'm gonna get you out of here.
can you get under the bed and wait for my signal?
Yeah. - You can do that?
Yeah. - All right.
it's okay. It's over.
the cops are gonna be here very soon.
I'm not with them. I'm with the government.
I can't really explain what happened here, but if you tell people Ray was alive, it's gonna raise questions.
questions without answers. Understand?
your boyfriend, he's waiting for you.
he wants a life together, and if you want that, too-- and I think you do
you can have it.
but you've got to forget about Ray.
all of this.
do you understand what I'm saying?
Yeah. Yeah, I do.
okay.
thank God. Are you okay?
Yeah.
where is he?
I don't know. He ...
he left a while ago, and he never came back.
place is clear.
tell me the truth...
was it Ray?
no.
ray's dead.
Kate Barrett credited her quick rescue to the efficiency and hard work of Pennsylvania state police.
as for the unidentified suspect behind her abduction, he's yet to be apprehended.
but troopers did find blood and torn clothing in the area, leading them to believe that the suspect is injured and, quite possibly, dead.
the blood and torn clothing?
well, cleaning isn't just about dissolving the bodies.
it's leaving enough of a story behind that folks don't ask questions.
well, good job.
Yeah. - Not just about that.
thank you for being there for Nikita.
look, Michael...
I know we haven't been on the same page lately, but you should know something.
you'll never have to worry about me protecting Nikita.
that's something I'll always do.
no thanks needed.
well...
you guys make a good team.
what did the doctor say?
I mean, I got some cuts and bruises, but I'll live.
good.
I'm glad you think so.
the way things have been going between us, I wasn't so sure.
I wanted you to make a choice.
me or this place. That's why I left.
how could I have made a choice when you were already gone?
well, you could have called. - You could have come back.
that's why I'm here.
look, what you said, about what most people would do?
don't ever expect that from me.
most people haven't seen their father murdered before their eyes.
most people aren't sold into slavery.
I'm not most people.
never have been. - I know.
I know. I should have known that.
Yeah, you should have.
are you angry? - Yes.
but not at you.
I can't do this.
not here.
you want to go a round?
I don't think so.
your hand not ready? - No.
aren't you the guy who once told me that you could take me with just one arm?
one arm behind my back.
it's your funeral.
nice try.
look, if you don't want to be out in the field anymore, that's fine.
Owen's ready to be my partner, and I've worked solo for many years, so I can handle myself.
Nikita, what do you want?
I want you to fight! For me! For us!
I don't need you as my partner in the field.
I need you as my partner in my life.
so fight!
want to even the odds? - Sure.
you want to move on? I understand.
but I will never move on from you.
Nikki, we got to talk.
remember when I said there was nothing better?
no better options for Michael?
Yeah. - Yeah, I lied.
there might be something better.
but it could open the door to something a hell of a lot worse.
what does that mean? What are you talking about?
I'm saying there might be a very real way for Michael to get his hand back.
Oh, Nikita, just go.
No! The tank's gonna blow!
I know. I want you to live. Just go. Please.
I'm not going.
I love you! Damn it, just go!
I love you.
where are we on Heidegger?
Heidecker.
Birkhoff, where are we on our best chance at fixing Michael's hand, please?
what do you think I've been doing here?
I've been going back over all the stuff Heidecker gave Division.
kill chips, polymer masks, pharmaceuticals, anything spy-fi.
and you found something?
no.
I remembered something.
Heidecker used to come in for follow-up visits.
he'd stop by, talk to the doctors, pick up any clinical data they recorded.
these guys used Division for advanced field testing.
to Percy, we were pawns.
to Heidecker, we were lab rats.
and that made me wonder.
who are Heidecker's lab rats now?
meet Kosta Beciraj.
deputy prime minister of Kosovo and one of Heidecker's newest test subjects.
on the surface, Kosta looks like any other politician, but scratch the surface and there's a chewy criminal center.
ties to organized crime, drug trade, human trafficking, you name it.
why would a guy like this agree to be somebody's lab rat?
about a year ago, Kosta was secretly rushed to the hospital for emergency surgery.
the official story is, he was receiving treatment for minor injuries after being attacked by his pet tiger.
who is this guy, a Bond villain?
keep your shirt on, double oh hottie.
he had the tiger put down, walled himself up inside his house.
he didn't want anyone to know the truth.
it wasn't a tiger.
the CIA tried to kill him.
now, they failed, but
he lost his leg.
Transtibial amputation.
now, check this out.
these were taken just a few weeks ago.
what the hell?
deal with the devil.
Spyfi.
how do we get him?
did some digging.
Heidecker's been visiting Kosovo about once a month.
his first stop is Kosta's house.
my guess would be some kind of maintenance on the wonder leg.
that, and maybe the sacrifice of a virgin or two.
he stays for three days and then flies back out for parts unknown.
do we know when his next trip is?
he flies in every month on the first.
that's today.
I have two days to get there, grab Heidecker, and bring him back?
what do you mean,"grab" him?
same thing I usually mean.
come with me. I'm not gonna hurt you. We gotta go.
so, I get him back here, and he shows us how to give Michael a new hand.
you think Ryan's gonna okay that?
this is not a Division Op. It's personal.
the only people who need to know are you, me, and...
Michael.
I gotta tell him.
Hey, how'd your meeting with the President go?
we're still standing here, so I think it went fine.
which brings me to what Michael and I were discussing.
given how well he ran Ops while I was in D. C.
I've asked him to assume that role permanently.
Yeah, it's like the job I used to have when Percy was running the place.
only Ryan promised that he won't try and kill me, so that's a little different.
well, it's the least I could do since the promotion doesn't come with a raise?
right.
that's great news. Congratulations.
Thanks.
I should probably get down there.
did you need me or Ryan?
okay.
he seems better.
how are you doing?
I'm still adjusting.
although not as fast as he is, I guess.
look, I know this can't be easy on you.
I wish there was something I could do to help.
actually, I could use some time off.
we need to confirm that that leg is real.
this'll do it, right?
let's make sure.
why don't I use it to examine your head since you seem to be suffering from some sort of brain damage?
I've been on solo missions before, nerd.
can't you call Alex or Owen or someone?
just have some backup?
no, Owen is still recovering from his broken ribs, and Alex has gone out of town with Sean, some sort of meet-the-family thing. I can't pull her away from that.
what about Mikey? You were gonna tell him. What happened?
he got a promotion.
he's doing better.
He--he's adjusting.
he even made a joke this morning.
was it funny?
look, that all sounds like good news.
it is. He's rebuilding his life.
so, if I go in there and tell him about this new hand and nothing comes of it?
I can't give him false hope, not after...everything.
dude's got a new leg.
that hope is not false.
neither is the danger.
why are you so afraid of this Heidecker guy?
he works for people who spend their days dreaming up new and interesting ways to commit murder.
kill chips. Bullets made of teeth.
that stuff that liquefies your stomach.
they're not nice folks. Trust me.
I am not afraid of a bunch of scientists.
you should be.
Birkhoff, they have something that I need.
if they are the only thing standing in the way of me and fixing Michael's hand, they are the ones who should be afraid.
pristina, KOSOVO
okay, Nikki... According to CIA files, the penthouse is home to one Bettina Fath.
former model and current mistress of Kosta Beciraj.
yes?
flowers.
just put it on the table, please.
no card?
no tip?
Kosta just left his office.
he's on his way to you now.
I know you're scared, but I'm not here to hurt you.
you are here to kill Kosta?
I need something from him, but I don't want to kill him.
why not?
he is a pig.
he deserves to die.
you have a gun. Why not shoot him?
well, I need him alive.
but if you can help me, I can help you.
Bettina, where are you?
you look tired.
you need to relax and let me take care of you.
so, what did you have in mind?
a sedative.
pig. - There's a ticket waiting for you at the airport.
when you land, check into the hotel.
there'll be a packet there, everything you need to start your life over.
thank you.
okay. Hold the ultrasound steady.
I need accurate measurements to calculate this. We don't want to kill him.
it really is live tissue.
over a metal endoskeleton.
actually, it looks like his bones are made of carbon fiber.
it's a little disappointing.
it's awesome.
okay, give him three ccs of the NSM-26.
how long till this drug does its job?
as soon as he wakes up, he'll feel warm and tingly.
then pain and swelling.
he'll be begging Heidecker for a house call before you know it.
we found Bettina's car at the airport.
she flew to Berlin.
no idea where she went from there.
keep looking. She does not get to leave me, understand?
my leg has, it's been bothering me ever since I woke up.
where is Heidecker?
our driver is on his way to meet Heidecker now to deliver the payment.
I find Mr. Beciraj's payment acceptable.
thank you.
all right, load the plane.
Mr. Beciraj needs to see you.
we're about to take off. I have a schedule that must be adhered to.
you will have to be late.
Hey, do you know where Nikita went?
Ryan said she took a few days off.
I'm not sure. I think she went somewhere with Alex.
like a spa or something.
or maybe not.
you're supposed to be out of town with your boyfriend.
sorry to expose your web of lies, but his sister canceled.
her kids are sick.
okay, let's try this again. Where's Nikita?
look, maybe you should call her and ask her yourself.
I don't want to be in the middle of this.
you're up to your neck in this.
whatever "this" is.
what is all this?
what did you do?
I overrode your hotkey app and restored all the hidden windows.
the timestamps on these are wrong.
no, they're not.
they have to be.
if this guy lost his leg a year ago, he can't be walking around.
as far as we can tell, it's not a prosthetic.
it's real flesh and blood grown over carbon fiber bone.
Oh, my God. Michael.
my leg is throbbing.
it hurts to walk.
there's swelling.
it must be that shot.
what, you give me bad medicine, maybe?
there is nothing wrong with the medication.
this sounds like a bug bite, some kind of allergic reaction.
call a doctor. - I called you.
you fix it.
I'm not a doctor.
my function is merely to observe and gather data from the test subjects.
I am not one of your lab rats.
or am I?
is your little experiment done?
have you decided it's time to put down the test subject?
no one is trying to kill you.
american agents already try and kill me.
that's how I lost my leg.
maybe they try again?
what, they get to you?
convince you to do the dirty work?
I don't have time to indulge your paranoia.
my friend.
you are not going anywhere.
Birkhoff, we have a problem.
I think Kosta may be crazier than we thought.
I gotta go in. - No, Nikita, you need to get out.
Michael, what are you-- - Pull out.
it's too dangerous, and you're alone in there.
I can't let them kill Heidecker.
damn it. Nikita!
what the hell is going on here?
you're going to fix my leg.
and you're going to give me all the wonder medicine I could ever need to make it strong and healthy.
until then, you will stay right here with me.
what?
the gun makes it very difficult for me to focus on your problem.
well, maybe I shoot you?
a leg for a leg.
maybe you'd focus then.
now, you don't want to threaten me.
and why is that?
come on, let's go.
looking for this?
Kosovo?
do you have any idea how delicate the political situation is there?
why the hell didn't you stop her?
please remind me of the last time someone successfully stopped Nikki from doing anything.
ever. - He has a point.
and we have an international crisis.
Nikita just assaulted the deputy prime minister of a U. N. recognized
Kosta Beciraj is a criminal.
everyone knows that.
he's a duly appointed government official.
that's what matters. - No, what matters is, she's captured.
wait, wait, wait, wait. Shut up, everyone. Shut up.
I got Nikki. She's close to her comm.
I will send them your head in a box.
maybe they can grow you a new body.
this is a misunderstanding.
No! I paid you for this leg and you double-cross me?
now it's you who will pay.
after you undo what you did to me.
and what did I do to you?
your accusations keep changing. Am I a mad scientist? Am I a CIA assassin?
Oh, you travel alone and pretend to feel no fear.
but she
she proves this is not so true.
pay close attention to what happens to your bodyguard.
it will happen much more slowly to you.
if you harm her, I won't help you.
why would he protect her?
he's buying some time.
maybe you're warm-blooded after all.
Michael, you can't go in there blind.
you come up with the plan.
I'll call you when I get there.
I gather his plan is, step one, fly to Kosovo, step two, kick ass?
I want to go with him.
take backup with you.
what, you shadow him every trip?
the medic is here.
not here. The kitchen.
take them to Kiki's room.
we'll continue this after I'm cleaned up.
and call Slavisa.
tell him I want the borders closed.
sir?
we may have other conspirators in the country.
they must not be allowed to escape.
tell the minister of defense to radio the checkpoints and close the borders now!
there's no way we can keep a lid on this.
no containment possible.
well, look, even if Kosovo flips out and seals its borders, it doesn't necessarily mean Division had something to do with it.
Yes, but if Danforth finds out and tells the President, then we are, all of us, dead.
they will brand Nikita as a rogue assassin and they will burn this place down to make sure we can't cause damage like this again.
I'm beginning to understand why Percy made the Black Boxes.
government has a trigger on you, you put a trigger on them.
how would Percy deal with this kind of thing?
he'd try to get ahead of it, spin something.
he called it "controlling the narrative.
Danforth.
commander, I hope you don't mind me calling you on your secure line.
that's what it's for, Fletcher. What's wrong?
nothing wrong.
just curious about the situation in Kosovo.
what situation?
Evan, please, I've got people on the ground in Macedonia.
they've heard the rumors.
I just need to know what to tell them.
rumors about what?
that Kosovo is getting ready to close its borders.
if there was something going on, I'd hear about it from Camp Bondsteel.
but you haven't.
you want to check rumors, call TMZ.
I don't have time for this.
now we just wait for him to call back.
what? Did it sound like I was lying?
no.
so, this is Kiki's room?
his pet tiger. Now deceased.
well, we haven't been formally introduced.
I know who you are.
what I want to know is why you saved me back there.
shameless self-interest.
Mr. Beciraj is going to kill me.
based on the skills you possess, courtesy of your Division training,
I decided that you afforded me the greatest chance of escape.
how do you know that--?
how do you know who I am?
I know every agent in Division.
not personally, of course. Statistically.
blood type, body mass, response time. Things of this nature.
right.
because we were just useful tools to you.
I hope so. In this case.
be careful.
some tools have a sharp edge.
now, you went to a great deal of trouble to find me.
I must have something that you need.
well, I subscribe to the principle of fair exchange.
if you help me, I would be happy to return the favor.
assuming you tell me what that favor might be.
one of our own was wounded...in combat.
he lost his right hand.
Oh, dear.
you made him a new leg.
I thought you could make us a new hand.
well, I didn't, uh, make the leg. The men I work for did.
I merely applied the technology and occasionally returned to service it, collect data.
same as I used to do at Division.
Birkhoff told me you were the source of the tech.
no, no, not the source.
the, sales rep for the source.
I saw that leg. The skin was real.
it was real. - Yeah, most of it is.
the bone is carbon fiber, of course, but the tissue
the tissue was regrown from his own DNA.
that's not possible.
you've worked with some of our prototypes.
I would hope that your perspective on what's possible might have been expanded by now.
I'm sorry if gadgets like the kill chip don't fill me with a sense of wonder.
we didn't design them to kill.
that was simply how Percy chose to apply the technology.
used in other ways, those chips could help millions of people.
you allowed your technology to be used in this way.
you gave it to a covert Black Ops group.
the military funding of science has led to breakthroughs that have changed the lives of every single human being in the world.
you mean like the atom bomb.
I mean, like atomic energy.
like the Internet, developed by DARPA.
like GPS, developed by the Navy.
yay, science.
the answer is yes.
we can make your friend a new hand, one indistinguishable from the one he lost.
but it can't be built from inside this cage.
so, what do you say we, we get me out of here.
now...
tell me what you did to my leg.
it's a slow-acting poison.
what you're experiencing right now is just the beginning.
by tomorrow, it'll be too painful to walk on, and by next week, you'll be dead.
you must fix it.
we can, but we'll need some assurances.
if we help you, you have to agree to let us go.
and what assurances do I have?
you already poisoned me once.
how do I know that the next shot's not going to make things worse?
you can test it out on one of your many men.
if he survives, you're safe.
and once your leg is healed, you'll take us to a location of our choosing and I will give you all the anti-rejection medicine I have.
we will leave.
you'll never see us again.
I accept your terms.
where is the antidote? In your bag?
no, I'm afraid not.
we'll have to manufacture the antidote right here.
and how long will it take?
several hours. And...
we need supplies.
that's quite a list.
it will take a while for my men to pull this all together.
you better hurry.
we wouldn't want that beautiful, perfect leg to rot and fall off while they're out shopping.
this is Fletcher.
you were right about the borders.
great call. No one else caught it.
what's the President's plan?
stall.
until we figure out how to handle this.
you remember what happened last year when the Kosovo police tried to take over the northern posts.
six months of violence on both sides of the border.
I don't suppose the U. N. Security Council wants to repeat that particular part of history.
they aren't sure what to do.
the prime minister can be reasoned with.
his right hand man is a different story.
it's why the CIA tried to take him out in the first place, right?
I don't suppose they could try again.
I can't risk another botched CIA job.
if we took him out, it would have to be clean.
invisible, even.
you're not suggesting
it's why Division was created, right?
do you think your people can get to Beciraj?
I believe we might have a way in.
I thought you said you weren't a scientist.
no, no, I said I wasn't the kind of a scientist who could engineer a way to regenerate someone's limb.
basic chemistry, I can manage.
so, the leg. Tell me how it works.
I can only explain it in the most rudimentary way.
good.
cause that's the only way I'll understand it.
all right.
we know that newts and salamanders can regrow severed limbs.
so, the researchers developed a chemical cocktail that creates pluripotent stem cells
the same thing salamanders use for regeneration.
do you know how much something like this costs?
I mean, I don't know if you got the memo, but Division lost most of its government funding.
our organization isn't interested in money.
we're very well funded. What we need is data.
the kind that comes from clinical trials, real world testing.
how did your friend lose his hand?
it would help me figure out if he's a good candidate for the regeneration process.
he was pinned under a burning car.
it was either cut off his hand or watch him die.
a clean cut.
not a crush injury. That's good, that's good.
I assume the amputation took place in the field, yes?
a great deal of blood loss?
there was a lot of blood.
too much.
medical support was an hour away, and, fortunately, there was a sharp blade and a burning car, so it only took a-- a few tries to cauterize the wound.
I'm sorry.
it must have been very difficult for you to, do what you did.
I don't think I'll ever get the sound of his screams out of my head.
when you see him whole again, you will.
okay, we're at the compound.
you told me to make a plan.
I'm all ears.
I need you to kill Kosta Beciraj.
this order has been sanctioned by the President.
Hey, I thought Division didn't do kill missions anymore.
consider this the last one. Good luck.
okay, we're in position.
from what we heard on the comm, they're holding them in Kiki's room.
it's behind the house in the old stables.
once you start moving, there's no cover between you and the house.
okay.
bill, you guys keep the guards busy on this side of the house.
and that'll be your position, once Chris takes care of the guards.
go! Go, go, go!
this is our shot.
all right, we're good. Go ahead and use the fire.
fire in the hole.
let's go.
Michael? What are you doing?
the keltrex prototype.
I prefer "Michael," but thanks.
what's the plan? - To get you out of here.
I've got a car half a mile up the road.
we won't make it on foot.
I saw another car on the other side of the house.
ops, I've got Nikita and a passenger.
we'll get another ride.
keep him distracted, but don't kill him.
Alex, target is on the south side of the building.
sir, Sir Sir, we must go! - I need Heidecker.
cover story?
Yeah, cover story.
ops, target is eliminated.
it'll look like his own man shot him.
copy that.
alpha team, disengage.
rendezvous with Alex and follow exfil route as planned.
did you erase the security footage?
like we were never there.
tell the President it's done.
Mikey, local fuzz got a call about all the noise.
they're coming to crash the party.
you need to stay off the main roads.
all right. Alex, take the team to the extraction point.
we'll find another way. We gotta get going now.
I have a plane. - Let's go.
it's Heidecker.
I'm on my way now.
please ready the plane and make sure the cargo is secure.
Oh, yeah, that model always was twitchy.
we had trouble calibrating the biosensors.
what we came to realize was that the myoelectric feedback had been weakened because the signal was spread across too many sensors.
I'm sorry. You lost us.
all Seymour needs to do is clip a few of the returns.
you'll get far more consistent results, although I doubt you'll be needing that prosthetic much longer.
do you really think the limb regeneration's gonna work?
well, from what you tell me about his injury and from what I can see in this incredibly poor light,
I believe Michael an excellent candidate.
we're here. Eh, just up ahead.
that gentleman in the black jacket is the last of Kosta's thugs.
we're going to have to deal with him before my pilot can take off, otherwise...
got it.
well, I'm sure you'll want to get started as soon as possible.
we'll need to run a few tests.
you're gonna want to start on the anti-rejection meds immediately.
why are there kids on the plane?
I told you to secure the cargo.
as I explained to Nikita, everyone pays what they can.
the children are Kosta's payment.
who are they? Were they kidnapped?
well, to be honest with you, it never occurred to me to ask. It was irrelevant.
real world testing is important to our research, and it's very difficult to find able-bodied test subjects.
they're children, not guinea pigs.
these children come from abject poverty.
they have extremely short life expectancies.
at least now, their lives will have some meaning.
no wonder you and Percy got along.
you're a monster.
and you're Division agents.
you've both killed plenty of people.
you can't be surprised that this is how the world works.
it doesn't mean we're gonna stand by and let you get away with this.
the President was quite impressed by what you did in Kosovo.
to be honest, so was I.
I know it was a delicate situation for the President.
making it look like an attempted coup?
stroke of genius.
it's not that I don't appreciate the kudos, but you could have said this all over the phone.
why'd you need to see me?
the President and I have given this matter a lot of thought.
we'd like to have a serious conversation about Division's future.
well, I assumed Birkhoff was exaggerating, of course, but you really did take over his whole space.
Yeah, I needed it to lay all of this out, but it's everything we found on that plane.
Heidecker can't talk, but maybe his stuff can tell us something.
I'm so sorry about Kosovo.
don't apologize.
I should thank you.
I was ready to give up and accept that this was the best I was ever gonna have, but you proved me wrong.
you gave me hope.
how? I shot Heidecker.
he's dead. - Yes. But the people he works for aren't.
they're still out there.
they can fix this. They can give me a new hand.
Michael, these are not good people.
Birkhoff was right to warn me about them.
Yeah, and you were right to ignore him.
this is my chance to get back what I lost.
I mean, I didn't even think it was possible.
now that I know that it is, I can't give up on that.
we can't trust them, and we certainly shouldn't be in business with them.
we won't be.
we'll find them, we'll take what we need, and we'll burn their house down.
whatever it takes.
whatever it takes.
how'd it go with the boss lady?
she was pleased with the operation in Kosovo.
no one suggested liquidating our assets even once.
that's good news, right?
what else did she say?
she was so impressed that she's asked us to look into a few other matters.
all right, hold on.
we all agreed that there wouldn't be any government missions.
we'd find these rogue agents and then we'd shut this place down.
strictly clean-up duty, with a real hard expiration date.
what do we do?
I mean, I feel like I've done enough.
it's four files.
we take care of them, maybe that's the end of it.
no, not the end.
this is how it begins.
Brighton BEACH, BROOKLYN
vodka.
well, I'll be damned.
the prince has returned to the slums from which he came.
on the house.
good, because I can't afford it.
drink.
I'll go get some of the good stuff in the back.
it's me. I have something.
Ari Tasarov himself has walked into my bar.
I don't know.
he looks like the world has given him a beating.
Ari Tasarov is wanted in connection with the murder of the CIA director.
after you left Naomi's body in the FBI morgue, people started asking questions.
the FBI searched her apartment.
they found an encrypted phone she used to communicate with her former Gogol handler.
he's got at least three agencies after him, FBI, Interpol, and CIA.
Amanda's little games caught up to him.
that's what happens when you get in bed with a schemer.
let's fire up Shadownet and see if we can catch him breaking pattern.
way ahead of you.
Shadowbot coughed up a mention of Ari Tasarov on a phone call.
sounds like it was between an FBI agent and his C. I. some bartender in Brighton Beach.
Ari's wanted for killing an American official. What's he doing in Brooklyn?
FBI's got the same question.
it looks like the world has given him a beating.
he says he's broke. - Broke?
the mighty are not so mighty anymore.
keep him there. We're on our way.
I will keep him here. You can believe it.
don't forget about me.
how long ago was that call? - Five minutes.
tactical's warming up the SUVs.
so he's in Brooklyn. He's broke.
sounds like he's on the run.
why don't you seem too happy about that?
because Ari's alone.
still waiting for the not happy part.
where is his beloved Amanda?
why is he on the run and she's not?
she's not wanted by Interpol. She's got no reason to hide.
right. So why is she not hiding him?
we shouldn't have let Ari escape.
you can stage the operation from here.
he knows nothing of this location.
but he knows me. - Saalim, do you really want to call this off now after you've come so far?
what about you? - What about me?
we have our reasons for wanting this.
you're an American. Why are you supporting us?
I also have a cause.
your success is going to help me with it.
as long as Ari stays out of the way.
Ari is a coward.
he's only as brave as his bank accounts...
which are now my bank accounts.
without his men or his money, he will crawl into the shadows and stay there.
we will not hear from him again.
are you sure this is okay?
the tab is open, and it can stay open.
I never liked you, Tasarov.
but...you settle your debts, and you are never far from a very big payday.
okay, listen up. FBI just reported they're on the scene. Get a move on.
we're here.
please stand back!
nerd, he's on the run.
can you get him on the street cams?
can do. Get mobile. I'll help you intercept.
what took you so long?
is that all you guys do around here is train?
helps kill time.
that's not so different from being in prison.
plus they have a yard, so at least I'd see some sun.
Actually...No, they'd keep a domestic terrorist like me in Supermax. No sunlight there, either.
you're not gonna be down here forever.
just until- - The next big American tragedy bumps me off the nightly news.
on the upside, at least I'll have some free time so I can pester you to tell me what that thing means.
if that is your idea of a good time, then we've gotta get you topside soon.
come on, it's just a tat.
I mean, sailors get 'em all the time.
it's a personal thing.
kind of private.
Really?
you kinda look like a billboard over there.
and you?
you're like a walking conspiracy theory.
how's that?
everyone thinks him and Naomi were working together.
navy SEAL was in bed with a Gogol sleeper.
that's almost funny.
no. It's not.
I was just messing with you.
I'm not offended. But I kind of like how she was offended for me. Yeah.
still, I'd--I'd ease off on the tats thing, you know?
she'll tell ya when she's ready.
I'm glad that we can finally talk.
you said you wanted to be safe.
from who?
trouble in paradise?
we're not together anymore. She doesn't know I'm here.
let me guess. You became a wanted man, and she no longer wanted you.
that's fairly accurate. - Oh, boo hoo.
you shouldn't have gotten in bed with her in the first place.
Yes, well, that's the trouble with Amanda, isn't it?
she makes her bed, and then one is forced to lie in it.
a few days ago I returned from Europe to learn I was being sought by every major law enforcement agency on the planet.
I was understandably agitated.
what the hell have you done now?
Interpol has three separate bulletins out on me!
it was your asset that blew the mission.
Yes, my asset.
Naomi was never meant to be activated.
one might say I came home to find another man in my bed.
who?
we'll get to that.
just know this: Like Naomi, he is an asset that Amanda has taken and twisted to her own ends.
Interpol? What's this about Interpol?
relax, Saalim. It's no problem.
can we discuss this in private?
please tell me you're not actually arming this amateur psychopath.
arming and teaching.
you're using him.
you're using him as part of your plot against Division.
what's Division? - I am exposed!
these are weapons I acquired.
I can't have any more suspicion fall on me!
he's right. He's a loose end.
if you don't want to be exposed as well, you'd better kill him.
timur, before you pull that trigger, consider this
you're not like Saalim.
you're not here for a belief or a cause.
you are here because you are well paid...
and I have frozen all of Ari's assets.
what? - If you pull that trigger, you'll be pulling it for free.
ask yourself-- is Ari worth that much?
is she lying?
I barely made it out of there.
and you ran straight for Division?
that's pretty desperate.
especially for you. - Yes, well, you'll thank me for that once I tell you who she's working with.
Amanda's gone too far this time.
all right.
who is this mystery asset?
terrorist. - Okay, terrorist. Who?
the answer to that question depends entirely on whether or not you're willing to make a deal.
well, how did I know that was coming?
no, Nikita, believe me...
you have no idea what's coming.
I'll give you a hint.
pittsburgh, PENNSYLVANIA
the first attack will seem like a random act of violence.
small. Isolated.
the target will be innocent average Americans.
I have my target.
I'll get the next one.
you'll know it when you hear about it.
but you won't be able to stop it, not without my help.
and how much is that gonna cost?
50 million. Electronically transferred to the J. S.L. Partner bank of Switzerland, account number 569711008.
50 million? - Correct.
dollars?
not Monopoly money?
that's awesome.
got a sec?
this is an unbelievable scene.
if you're just tuning in, as of right now, authorities are unclear of much of anything.
was it a disgruntled employee, a random assailant?
there are reports, all of them unconfirmed, that a man in a business suit fled the scene.
Birkhoff, tap us into local first responders- - see what they know.
on it. - That remains to be--pardon me.
I'm just getting word that we are receiving a claim of responsibility, a transmission.
it is streaming from the web right into E.N.N. headquarters.
let's listen in.
how's it feel?
everything you love ripped away in a second.
when it happens in America, it's called a national tragedy.
when it happens in our countries, it's called collateral damage.
acceptable losses.
a percentage some General signs off on before drones start flying.
you send your troops, your helicopters, your drones, to kill your enemies.
but you hit innocent people too.
you say you want peace.
your so-called road to peace is splattered with our blood.
call us the Crimson Resistance.
we don't know when death will come.
neither will you.
the people we love were taken from us, and we never had a chance to say good-bye.
neither will you.
tapped into E.N.N. servers, got a line on that video stream.
no way to trace it, but the packet encryption is definitely Division signature.
how do you know that? - I wrote the algorithms.
which means Amanda is on the other end of that broadcast, - just like Ari said she would be. - Son of a bitch.
he knows who this is and he's holding out for money?
wait a second, wait a second.
look, Ari surrendered.
then he asked to be brought into Division, and then he tries to get 50 million out of us.
he'd have to either be crazy or stupid, and the man is neither.
well, he must have another move.
maybe he's trying to raise money, build an army, break himself out of here?
it doesn't matter. He's not gonna get 50 bucks, much less 50 million.
I wouldn't give him 50 seconds.
give me an empty room and a pair of pliers
I'll use 'em to take off Ari's fingernails, one by one.
he'll break after his pinky.
he's trained to resist torture.
Ari's a negotiator.
just give me some more time with him.
we still have a few moves of our own.
okay. In the meantime, let's get you two on the ground in Pittsburgh, see if we can't get some clues from the crime scene.
I thought it would feel different.
how does it feel?
when that stray bullet...
took my little girl...
it was like I'd been torn apart from the inside out.
I remember holding her...
screaming so loud I couldn't hear myself.
I thought then I had wanted revenge, but
this isn't revenge.
you want them to feel what you feel.
it's the only way they'll learn.
they need to scream so loud they can't hear!
Saalim...I know where you're coming from.
it's why I'm assisting you.
you're not laughing anymore.
what does Amanda get out of helping a bunch of terrorists?
why does Amanda do anything these days?
you.
she's trying to frame Division.
you armed the Crimson resistance to create a panic.
the weapons they're using are the last few I purchased from Cyrus, your former arms dealer.
Oh, I assure you, the trail will lead right to Division's front door.
unless you end it now.
for a price.
what are you gonna do with $50 million?
you can't spend it from a prison cell.
the real question is how much are those innocent lives worth to you?
I don't put a price on human life!
then 50 million is a bargain.
then that would be for your life as well.
my life? - Yeah.
or whatever you want to call spending the rest of your existence in a 7x12-foot box, because no matter what...
you are never getting out of here.
the attacker worked his way through the lobby.
security cameras were scrambled.
division tech.
courtesy of Amanda.
they didn't ask for this.
just got caught up in somebody else's war.
I think that was the idea.
it's a good kill.
simple, yet still a little bit dirty.
just like Division.
Amanda's teaching them well.
just like Amanda taught us.
me, she just stuck with a needle.
you still don't remember any of it?
part of me's not sure I really want to.
one thing I do remember is Amanda said, I used to be a soldier.
my name was Sam.
and I killed all my friends.
Owen, don't let her define you.
don't let anyone.
she taught us.
she taught them. Birkhoff.
how's that help us?
Ari said Amanda gave the terrorists equipment.
maybe she gave them ghost phones.
Yeah, so?
you said that the video streaming used our encryption signature. Don't the phones?
Yes, but we can't trace them.
that's the point. - Just go with me.
can we find any evidence of the encryption on the cell towers around here?
okay, the call logging in the towers at the time of the attack does show evidence of the encryption, but again
we can't trace it. But...
if they were to use the phones and talk before the next attack, we might be able to trace where they're about to hit next.
sure, if we jacked into every cellular network nationwide.
are you telling me that Shadowbot is not up to the task?
bite your tongue, princess.
we do agree on one thing.
what's that?
you are a spy, not a terrorist.
I like to get things done without firing a shot.
I had a chance to kill you once.
in '06.
at a basketball game. You brought your son.
or have you forgotten?
I lied to Division.
I told them that my rifle jammed.
you owe me.
I spared your life. I took care of you.
you simply behaved exactly the way Amanda thought you would.
she called me.
she told me to bring my son to the game.
she knew you'd figure out a way to not murder me in front of him.
killer with a conscience.
she told you to use your son as a prop?
was there no place she would draw the line?
we both used the relationship to our mutual benefit.
she's been playing you from the jump, Ari.
every single one of your plans has been derailed by her obsession with hurting me.
lately, yes. - Then what are you waiting for?
she ruined you. Let's bury her.
all you have to do is give me the name, and we can end this now.
Amanda is all the reason you need.
Oh, I can think of 50 million more.
he's not budging.
how did Alex and Owen make out? - Nothing concrete.
just a plan to isolate the terrorist's phone, which is a long shot, a very long shot.
it looks like our only other option is to pay the son of a bitch.
let's say we did. - We ran that.
well, run it for me.
the account Ari mentioned is on a secure VPN.
you put the money in, and it gets walled off.
it's only accessible through a dedicated satellite uplink.
so, we drop in the money and we track it.
Birkhoff can find it through satellite.
we'll know where it's going and what it's for.
too risky.
it's the federal government.
it's 50 mill. It's a drop in the bucket.
it would be if we were actually funded by the government.
what are you talking about?
oversight used to tear off little black budget earmarks for Division.
feed the dog under the table.
not anymore. The President doesn't want any taxpayer money flowing into this place.
how do we have an operating budget?
we received some seed money, which I grew into a sizeable pile of cash with Birkhoff's help.
nothing illegal.
point is, our operating budget is currently 53. 6 million.
we pay Ari, we're running on fumes.
so unless you want to start taking mercenary jobs for profit, paying up...
means shutting down.
RDMED, MICHIGAN
I have a target.
people are in shock.
if you're just joining us, we are hearing that the Crimson Resistance has struck in the small town of Romeo, Michigan.
no one is safe. Authorities still have no leads.
to strike terror in the hearts of all Americans.
and I'm hearing... Five dead.
gunned down at a roadside stand.
where will they strike next?
I've just been informed we're getting another message, a transmission that's coming into the E.N.N. headquarters.
let's listen in.
from your biggest cities to your smallest farms...
no one is safe.
many of you will now want to stay at home with your families, behind closed doors. It won't make a difference.
the next attack will be in a normal suburb, in a normal house. Maybe yours.
my God, they're all random targets.
how many more of these are coming?
this is the last one.
like the innocents who have died in your wars
the acceptable losses-- you won't be able to predict it.
and soon, very soon I hope, your fear will turn to anger.
and that anger will awaken you to the truth.
the only way to stop the violence...
is for you to end it first.
tell me...
the terrorist's...
name!
all you've gotta do is give me a name.
all you have to do is pay.
$50 million.
countless lives saved. It's a simple transaction.
you are not gonna see a dime.
there is no way you win.
don't worry about me. Worry about Amanda.
if she wins, Division dies, unless you pay.
clock's ticking.
okay, I just flagged our encryption on a cell tower in Columbus, Ohio.
if the terrorists are talking to each other, it's in this neighborhood.
it's too soon for another attack.
the hits have all been in 24-hour intervals.
maybe it's an early call? They're prepping?
it is in the suburbs, like our whack job predicted.
do we have surveillance on sub-level 12?
no cameras in the dungeon.
no one ever wanted to see what went on down there.
look, Nikki's just trying to do the same thing we all are
prevent the next attack. Just focus on that.
all right.
if you gotta find a needle, it'll help to shrink the haystack.
we can get our teams out there quick.
you're worried about Nikita.
I'm worried she's going to kill him, and then we'll have no leads.
go. I'll cover for you here, help coordinate the teams.
all right.
I can do this all day.
forever.
is that what you think that ring means?
you getting delusional now, Ari?
you're tougher than that. - Your sad attempt to build a life with Michael...
that's how Amanda and I started so many years ago.
now look at us.
there's no forever in this business.
you know, someone once told me to beat a monster you have to...
get down on their level.
fight fire with fire.
let's get started.
you gonna tell me to stop now, Michael?
you afraid this is gonna end up like Sierra Leone?
Yes. - Well, that was worth it.
we broke our target that time, didn't we?
but at what price?
why, thank you, Michael...
for lending me a hand.
you've heard of an eye for an eye.
how about a hand for a hand?
Nikita, that's enough! That's enough!
Ari, you better give me that name now, 'cause I'm not gonna be able to hold her off of you much longer.
the couple that tortures together stays together. Is that it, Michael?
what was the code word?
sierra Leone?
I've done too many versions of good cop/bad cop, children.
how do you know which one I am?
when's the wedding, Michael?
have you even set a date?
if your relationship meant anything to either of you, you wouldn't be here.
ops, we're on scene.
Columbus, OHID
the other three teams are in their sectors.
head east, towards Tivoli Court.
assuming they're gonna try to make a quick escape like they have in the past, that street has the best egress towards the interstate.
copy that. We're on the move.
first Nikita, now you. - What's that?
I ride off with the cowgirl, while the boyfriend stays back at the ranch.
Owen Elliot. Designation: Third wheel.
right.
Thanks, by the way.
what you said back at the elevators.
Emily used to say stuff like that all the time, that I could change.
that's why I got my-- my butterfly.
she said it was proof that- - people can have a second life.
Yeah.
someone I knew used to say the same thing all the time.
is that why you got your ink?
she was a girl in the pla, in the brothel.
that's where they put me when I first came here.
we shared a room.
she said she would dream some nights about escaping by climbing to the roof and flying away on butterfly wings.
one night she got high.
she made it up there...
to the roof, and...
she decided to try and fly.
you know, she's just like those people in the elevator.
innocent.
I'm sorry.
guys, listen up.
I think I just caught a whiff of our encryption on the local cell network.
you should be right on top of it.
ops... We may have something.
I'm gonna get out. Keep driving past.
the target is in sight.
where are they? - They are inside.
I go now.
drop your weapon!
something's wrong.
where is he?
Where's the man who gives you orders?
Where's the man who gives the orders?
the attacks will keep coming if we don't break him.
Owen was right. He should have broken by now.
maybe he's greedier than we thought.
he's not gonna take this much abuse.
no way. Doesn't matter how much money he thinks he's gonna make.
what is he holding out for?
what would you hold out for?
you. - Seriously.
I am serious.
the only reason to hold out is for someone you love.
Yeah, but to say he loved Amanda is a stretch, and she left him anyway.
so who does he have that
what?
it's for Stefan. That's who the money's for.
you're holding out for your son.
I'm trying to give my son a life.
a real life, away from all this.
50 million. That's quite a golden ticket.
the money is for a trust.
and for his caretaker, an elite operative who will protect him from the likes of you.
or Amanda. - You should have told us.
we would have protected him.
why, so you could use him against me?
or use us both as a lure to catch Amanda?
I wouldn't have done that.
you're my sworn enemy, Nikita.
forgive me if I didn't give you the benefit of the doubt.
right, so instead you traded in on innocent lives, like your son's
he didn't ask for any of this!
he certainly didn't choose his birthright.
you didn't have a plan to get out of here, did you?
you ask me what I call my future existence in a 7x12-foot box. I call it my fate.
and I accept it.
all right. Then accept this.
we are not funded by the government anymore.
I don't have that kind of money.
and if your caretaker is not paid, the only thing standing between your son and Amanda's retribution is me.
the terrorist's name is Saalim Nassar.
a Yemeni-born American citizen. He was visiting his home country when a stray bullet from an American raid struck and killed his only daughter.
I don't have his location, but I have his personal phone number.
division should be able to trace it.
you said they wouldn't find us, and I hear one of my people killed on the line!
something's happened. - You heard them.
who could they have been?
one of your people made a mistake.
we didn't do anything different!
this is your fault. - The equipment is sound.
then someone's helping them!
it can't be on my side.
I don't pick the target until the last minute.
someone on your side is helping them.
am I wrong?
Saalim, there are no sides here.
my cause is your cause, and the world knows exactly who the Crimson Resistance is.
it's not enough.
there needs to be at least three.
you're right.
we'll broadcast sooner, before the next attack.
keep them terrified, off balance, the way they should be.
we got him. Birkhoff tracked his phone.
he's in an apartment on the upper West Side.
grab team? - Alex and Owen.
they were already choppering back here, but they diverted, and they're close.
good. - Not good.
what is it?
news outlets are receiving another live broadcast.
some people say we should stop.
we will not.
Birkhoff, now that we know where he is
Yes, I know, I know. Tapping local Wi-Fi.
as I speak, another attack is being prepared.
when I am finished, I will signal them to continue.
Owen and Alex will never make it.
can we shut him off? I got a better idea.
Birkhoff, let's hack into this guy's software.
copy that.
time for Toto to pull the curtain back on the wizard.
only then will your voice be the one your leaders hear.
we will not stop until this policy is changed, until we put an end to random, indiscriminate murd
Michael, this is the frame up Ari was talking about.
Hello, is this the counter-terrorism section?
I have a very important tip for you.
clear!
all clear.
ops, we're clear.
better get crackin'. FBI's on the way.
Birkhoff, are you sure this is gonna erase every trace of Division off this computer?
super clean, baby.
just like you like it.
I'll clean the rest.
I got an encrypted phone call. It's her.
we got it upstairs.
Yeah.
word on the street is Ari Tasarov's been picked up by federal agents.
don't believe everything you hear.
I know he's there, and I know he's helping you.
is that why you called? To confirm a rumor?
I just have one question: Why the delay?
you couldn't get Saalim's name out of him?
I didn't need to. You did that.
I'm a hero, just like you.
you are gonna pay for the lives you took.
you had the chance to kill me once before, Nikita.
but for some reason, you didn't. That was a mistake.
I guess I have a target on my back now.
just like Stefan.
Nikita, are you still there?
you leave that boy out of this.
Ari betrayed me.
the boy is fair game.
something has to be done.
it will.
you're gonna sit down and you're gonna give us all the details of Amanda's operation
names, dates, everything.
and if this protector of yours is as good as you say he is, then Stefan will be fine until the current deposit runs out.
shortly after Amanda's betrayal, I found myself alone, riding the subways.
I ran through every possible scenario, and I realized I was in a place I'd never been.
I was out of moves.
I've been there. Tends to change your priorities.
Yes, well, it suddenly became very clear to me that the only thing worth fighting for was my son.
which is why I did what I had to do.
and no...
I don't expect you to understand.
but I do.
I'm here to protect the innocent.
the difference is, I'm not gonna lose myself in the process, because if I do, Amanda wins.
and I'm not gonna let that happen.
all traces of Division gone?
FBI thinks Saalim was killed by one of his comrades, so...
we're safely back in the shadows.
you all right?
they were together for 20 years.
it was all a charade.
but it was Amanda. How could it not be?
there's no forever in this business.
that's what he told me.
well here's what I have to say to that.
Varca Beach.
Goa? - South side.
there's a little hut on the water right about here.
a few paces away from that...
is a perfect place for a ceremony.
does Birkhoff know you're using his satellite to plan our wedding?
I'll let him pick the caterer.
Oh, no you won't.
let's set a date...
and stick to it.
done and done.
okay, I want admin-level access to the Swiss P. D.
what they see, we see.
Heidi yodels in the woods and someone phones in a noise complaint, I want to know about it.
it's been eight hours.
she could have crossed the border by now.
no, no, not Zurich--Geneva. The radius starts here.
what was that exit strategy again?
no exit strategy. Cops were improvised.
was that her call, or was that yours?
hers. What does it matter?
I'm just trying to figure out how the hell Amanda pulled Alex out of the back of a police car, when just an hour earlier, you were sitting three feet away from her.
because you think the answers are so easy.
no, I think Alex is in danger again.
it doesn't matter what the exit strategy was.
we are going to find her. We are.
Michael's right. Amanda's not gonna kill her.
if she wanted that, she would have done it on the spot.
she has a plan.
I got her. I got Amanda. - Put it on the map.
no, I mean, I got Amanda on the line. She's calling in.
Hello, Nikita.
it's prerecorded. I can't trace it.
I don't know about you, but I found Switzerland to be very fruitful.
I may not have gotten what I came for, but I walked away with something far more valuable.
I guess that's the thing about being on the run.
you never know when things will suddenly turn your way.
the offer I'm going to make should be relatively easy for you.
hand Ari over to me, and I'll give you Alex.
I'm sending the coordinates for the exchange.
be there in 48 hours, or Alex dies.
you're not seriously considering this, are you?
why not?
she's right for once. It'd be an easy trade.
I have the code for decrypting the Black Box.
you hand me over to her, you'll be giving her the key to all of your government's darkest secrets.
she had access to the box's contents before.
we survived.
Yes, that's because I kept her in check.
what do you think she'll do with that information now?
she'll topple presidents.
she'll cause global conflict.
she'll wipe out Division without even blinking.
that's tomorrow's problem.
today we save Alex.
I'm assuming it's not even a consideration that you'll be signing my death warrant.
you should have picked your girlfriend better.
of course, you can give us the password to the Black Box.
that'll give us a chance to negotiate, give her the code without turning you over.
Yes, I can't do that. - Why not?
because I don't actually have the code.
I am the code.
it's a subliminal password.
the security system only unlocks after I perform a series of tasks on the computer, very much like playing a video game.
it's a double lock, so Amanda needs to do the same.
the software detects patterns that we ourselves are unaware of.
you guys are just too clever for your own good, aren't you?
Yes, while my death may be meaningless to you, there are a few things I'd like to point out.
relax, Ari.
we are trading you for Alex.
but we'll get you back.
as much as you deserve it, we're not gonna let Amanda get her claws into you.
why not? - Because...
screw Amanda.
Amanda sure knows how to choose her vacation spots.
the coordinates she sent lead to South Ossetia.
look up "hostile environment" in the dictionary, and I'm pretty sure they're using stock shots from here.
war in '08 pretty much left the place a smoking ruin,
Russians and Georgians still in armed conflict, organized crime groups profiting from the chaos.
it's like the wild west, if the wild west had A. K.s and vodka.
that's why she picked this place for the meet.
she's out of manpower. This levels the playing field.
great. We'll go in small and quiet--just Nikita and Sean. - And Owen.
Owen's in lockup. I put him there after he assaulted a guard.
we need him.
we're taking a flight risk through a hostile theater.
it's more than a two-man Op.
the guy's a bull. I thought you wanted to go in quiet.
Owen will be fine, and we could use him when we recover Ari.
we're recovering Ari? - After we get Alex back.
we can't let Amanda use him to unlock the box.
right, but Alex is the priority.
where am I?
don't worry about that now.
careful.
you have been given a lot of sedatives
Phenobarbital, I think, probably some painkillers too.
are you a doctor?
a medic.
I'm Larissa.
it's just saline.
you have been out for over 24 hours.
they told me to watch you, make sure you didn't stop breathing.
who?
Hello, Alex.
how are you feeling?
I can't have you dying on me now.
you're the key to getting everything I want.
well, it's been a long time since we've had a proper conversation.
I'd offer you some tea, but I don't think these people can boil water.
still keeping high-class company, I see.
the Ossetians are just a partner of convenience.
I was able to fill some of their needs.
soldiers always need more weapons.
and in return, they've allowed me safe haven in their country.
so what's the plan...
torture...videotaped and sent to Nikita?
perhaps later.
but for now, let's just keep it casual?
tell me, how are things at Division?
fine.
everyone's very excited about hunting you down.
see, I-it must be stressful, knowing the government could come in and wipe you out at any moment.
ginkgo biloba helps, so does ginseng.
and Michael and Nikita
how are they dealing with his disability?
been rough, but I think they'll get through it.
I mean, other couples have survived bad haircuts before, haven't they?
as long as Nikita has Ari, you still have some value, but I never promised to return you in one piece.
now, about Ari, tell me
how did Division capture him?
Capture"?
he came in on his own.
that's how desperate he was to get away from you.
don't gloat, Alex.
it wasn't your victory.
it was Nikita's, as they all are.
you're just a background player.
status report.
team touched down in South Ossetia 18 minutes ago.
they're headed to pick up their baggage.
south OSSETIA
Yes.
he's gonna be so dead if you don't revive him in the next ten minutes, after which, the tetrodotoxin will kill him for realsies.
Ari looks kind of peaceful dead.
let's leave him that way.
sorry, I don't think Amanda's gonna trade for a mostly dead Ari.
if they stay on the back roads, they should avoid the military checkpoints.
good. Let me know when they reach the city.
you getting any E. M. interference out of that airport?
negative. All clear on my end.
okay, cycle the channels on the trackers.
I think whatever primitive transmission standards they're using out there in the land that time forgot might be messing with our signals.
you know, maybe you should go back there and help Nikita with the revival process.
it can get a little bit tricky.
I mean, I know. I just went through it.
I'm pretty sure she's okay.
she's better at this kind of stuff than anybody.
so what's your deal, man?
are you just this guy who latches on to women that he knows he can't have?
excuse me?
Nikita, Alex...
you got your signals majorly crossed.
I was on the comms when you guys were tracking those terrorists.
I heard your little heart-to-heart.
I don't know what you think you heard, but we were having a conversation, like people do, nothing more.
sure about that? - Yeah, I am.
and if you're not, maybe your problem's not with me.
maybe your problem's between you and Alex.
you know what? Maybe I will give her a hand.
why don't you pull over right here?
why are you working with Amanda?
I do not work for her.
the soldiers-- they tell me to help her.
so you're with the Ossetians.
I'm their prisoner.
when the war broke out, my husband and I gave shelter to the injured.
when the separatists discovered that some of the wounded were Georgians, they accused us of being sympathizers.
they took me with them because of my medical training.
and your husband?
they stood him up against our living-room wall...
and they shot him.
so I'm as trapped as you.
in that case, you can help me get the heck out of here.
it is no use.
this place is filled with soldiers because they store weapons in the building.
it's an old trick.
they know even the enemy would not bomb a hospital.
that will not work.
it is too small.
that won't be a problem.
so how did...
Alexandra Udinov end up here?
what? I don't
Oh, I knew you immediately.
your story was everywhere.
Anya loved hearing about it.
Anya? - My daughter, seven
she's with her grandparents.
we used to watch news every night, listen for the word of Russian princess who miraculously came back to life.
it was Anya's favorite fairy tale.
it wasn't exactly a fairy tale in real life.
what happened?
you had all that money, all that fame.
I chose a different path.
here, try this.
and you angered this woman
the one who is so interested in you?
Amanda. She's not interested in me.
she's trying to hurt someone else.
I'm just her way of doing it.
so you're just another victim.
Anya would be disappointed.
so where are we?
welcome to South Ossetia.
south Ossetia?
that's not good.
wasn't exactly our choice.
here, stay hydrated.
the tetrodotoxin can do a number on your electrolytes.
and if we get stopped, stay quiet.
let us do the talking.
you try anything, Amanda won't get a chance to rip you apart.
I'll do it first.
you know, it's no wonder you lost your memories.
your brain had insufficient power to hold on to them.
if we get stopped, my silence might not be enough.
what are you talking about?
Zetrov's defense contractors played a major role in the South Ossetian war.
they had me accompany some weapons systems here as a consultant.
I won't go into the details.
suffice it to say, I'm not a very well liked man around these parts.
Why? What'd you do?
they may believe I'm responsible for a massacre...
or two.
I told you, South Ossetia--not good.
what's wrong?
did you modify those tracker signals?
Yeah.
I'm still getting that weird interference.
it's narrowband in origin.
it looks like there's another signal coming from inside their truck.
inside the truck?
what kind of signal would be coming from in
do you recognize it?
unfortunately, yes.
Mikey, we got to talk.
you put a kill chip in Ari Tasarov's head?
Yes, I did...
during the tetrodotoxin procedure.
I did it to save Nikita's life.
it was never a question that we were gonna do this mission.
Alex's life depends on it.
but we need to be clear about what we're talking about
giving Amanda the Black Box.
giving Amanda the Black Box.
Yeah, we understand the consequences.
that's why we're rescuing Ari after we get Alex back, so she can't use him to decode the box, right?
give me your honest tactical evaluation of that plan.
it will be tough, but...
it's a dog
high risk, low probability of success.
Amanda will be on the move.
she'll have protection. She'll be on guard.
no. The smart play is to...
kill Ari after we make the trade for Alex.
kill Ari, and the code dies with him.
why did you keep us in the dark?
we could have built a mission plan around that.
because Nikita never would've let that happen.
she would have insisted on saving him.
she's Nikki.
that's why you sent Owen.
he's the triggerman. He hates Ari.
Nikita can't know...
for her own safety.
you're gonna tell her, right?
Ryan's right. She'll risk her life for him.
you have to tell her. - No!
I do not like that you did this behind our backs, but I understand...
why you did it in the first place.
but now that it is done, we have got to keep this quiet.
did I do that right? It was perfect. Come on.
wait. No, you go. I-I'll tell them that you forced me.
it is too dangerous. - No, it'll be all right, I promise.
trust me.
look out!
let me see.
let me see.
okay, keep pressure on it.
go. - No.
you must.
Birkhoff says there's a weapons cache at a dead drop in the village.
it's not that far.
Owen, why don't you go with Sean, back him up?
it's okay. I'll be all right with Ari.
Yes, I understand these small-minded tasks are usually reserved for you, Mr. Elliot, but I'm sure Nikita can handle this on her own.
the only drawback to turning you over to Amanda is that I won't get to watch you die.
okay. Why?
why do you do that? Is that necessary?
I don't know. There's just something about him that draws it out of me.
for the life of me, I don't understand what you see in him.
there's more to Owen than you think.
Amanda was right.
your compassion will be your downfall.
Amanda is not right about anything.
she has her blind spots, but she excels at ferreting out the weakness of people.
with you, she's aiming directly for the heart.
only Amanda could use love as a weapon.
as I recall, when you needed some information on Saalim, you were very quick to use my son's safety as leverage.
that was-- I wasn't trying to
I'm not looking for an explanation or an apology.
I know the rules of the game.
this is the life we've chosen.
and that's also why...
I know there will be no rescue for me.
Ari, I'm not playing a con.
no? - No.
I've run the scenario in my head.
tactically, it doesn't make any sense.
if I was in Ryan Fletcher's shoes, I wouldn't authorize the mission.
however you parse this, it ends with my death.
very resourceful, Alex.
it seems you did learn a thing or two from Nikita.
but here's something I've learned.
stop!
you have yet another weakness.
now, about those questions...
what does it matter?
nothing I say will ever help you.
interesting, isn't it?
how fiercely you protect Division the place you've hated for so long.
how did that happen?
Oh, right, it was Nikita's idea.
did she even bother to ask you first?
no.
because she doesn't know what I know
that there's another Alex, one who doesn't take orders, one who gives them.
I've seen her-- the heir to the Zetrov throne.
that was just a dream...
one you created by pumping me full of drugs.
no.
it was your potential, one you could still fulfill.
why do you care, Amanda?
because one day what you want and what Nikita wants will come into conflict, and I cannot wait to see the look on Nikita's face when it does.
Amanda's bullet would be a welcome relief for this headache.
move your hand.
son of a... - What is it?
what is it?
Birkhoff, there's a kill chip in Ari's head.
no, no, wait a minute. Wait--wait a minute.
no, no, no. You knew about this.
that's crazy. - Birkhoff?
she knows. - How?
I don't know. - Birkhoff, answer me.
Yeah, Michael wants to talk to you.
you put a kill chip in his head when the doctors put him under?
Ryan did. - Then get him on the line.
Nikita, listen to me. - No, we agreed.
the plan was to get Alex and recover Ari.
the plan is too risky. We could lose the Black Box.
but more importantly, we could lose you.
how are you gonna trigger it?
there's no way to know from Ops when the trade was done.
you would need someone
why should we let this bastard live?
have you forgotten how many times he's tried to kill us?
no, I haven't.
and he'll pay for his crimes, but not like this.
why not? This is what he deserves.
that's not your call.
I got something going on up here.
he stabbed me, he lied to me, and then he laughed about it.
I could push the trigger right now.
there's another way. - We don't need another way!
give me the trigger.
why'd you save us?
I saved myself.
it was the only way I could see not ending up facedown in a ditch.
the way I see it, my options are rather limited.
if I had let you die, the Ossetians would have hung me in the nearest town square or handed me over to Amanda.
either way, you are still my best hope for coming out of this alive.
besides, if you die, Amanda wins.
and to quote your eloquence,"Screw Amanda."
here's the trigger.
you should have escaped when you had the chance.
I couldn't do that. - Why not?
I was told you never leave a friend behind.
time to go.
listen to me.
you hold on, okay? I'm coming back for you.
no.
you saw how many soldiers there are.
it is suicide.
I have friends coming back for me, and I'm gonna return with all of them.
all right.
but if you can't, don't feel bad.
sometimes no matter how much you want to help, you can't stop someone from dying.
no, don't do that.
don't you want to see your daughter again?
I will.
I will see her. - That's right.
where did you say her grandparents live?
I didn't.
they are with my husband also...
so is Anya.
but she would be so happy...to know that I was friends with Alexandra Udinov.
I'll see you on the other side.
I am not leaving here without you.
lots of eyes, lots of hardware.
Yeah, that's what Amanda wants.
if we try anything, this place erupts.
after the exchange, Amanda's not gonna stick around.
she's gonna have exfil ready.
I can track Ari's kill chip within a five-mile radius.
if we stay close, we'll be okay.
she'll have security, at least until she's out of the country.
intercept, takedown, extract--by my count, this is a four-man job.
anything less, we got a high risk of failure.
we're getting Alex back.
we're going in at full strength.
got 'em. Amanda and Alex plus one.
I'm not leaving here without you.
come on.
are you okay?
Yeah, it's been a regular holiday.
it's good to see you, Ari.
I can't say the same.
no point in drawing this out.
they say with any good trade, both parties leave a little disappointed.
I'm not disappointed at all.
Really?
then maybe I didn't ask for enough.
or maybe you underestimated how much you've given up.
I certainly haven't.
Owen, they're on the move. Find her transport.
they're in a black van headed west by southwest.
she's got an armed escort.
thank God.
you okay? What did she do?
I'm fine. She didn't do anything.
we're going to recover Ari.
what?
no. No, there's a woman who was helping me, and she's hurt. She's being held prisoner by the military.
I said that we would save her.
okay. We'll go get her after.
no, she's dying. She doesn't have time.
Alex, Amanda's gonna use Ari to open the Black Box.
we have to get to her before that happens.
okay, then you go. I'm going back for Larissa.
Alex, we need you.
we can't do this unless we go in full force.
there's another option.
use the trigger.
what trigger? - Ari has a kill chip.
Nikita could end the threat of the Black Box right now.
no. - Why not?
because we don't sacrifice people, we save them.
that's what I'm trying to do!
Ari is the priority. - Why, because you say it is?
Alex, please...
we need you.
Alex. - Let 'em go.
let's go get Ari. Come on.
Birkhoff, are you there?
Alex?
it's good to hear your voice, girl.
Thanks, we can get all emo later.
look, I need you to find a hospital.
you hurt?
no, it's where Amanda was holding me
somewhere in the combat zone.
check facilities that the Ossetians could have used for weapons storage.
okay, just give me a minute.
is she safe? - Yeah, yeah, she's with Sean.
according to their trackers, Nikita and Owen have split off.
Owen, why haven't you activated the contingency plan?
because...
Nikita has the trigger.
Nikita, I want you to listen to me.
activating that kill chip is the only smart course of action.
can't do that. - Why not?
because we don't make that choice.
or have you forgotten that we're not that kind of Division?
Nikita, it's just you and Owen.
you cannot pull this off.
like I said...
she's Nikki.
Birkhoff, you find that hospital?
Yeah, I think so.
I'm sending coordinates of a possible match to Sean's phone now.
here. You navigate.
your turn.
I could refuse.
after I unlock the code, you're just going to kill me anyway.
you of all people should know there are many ways to die.
over the years, I envisioned how our relationship might end, Amanda, but I never thought it would end like this.
it didn't have to end at all.
you're the one who betrayed me and went scurrying to Division.
Yes, I know all about that.
it's astonishing how you choose to define your reality.
division was a last resort after you tried to kill me.
well, you know what they say
betrayal is in the eye of the beholder.
finish the code.
what's Alex and Sean's status?
they just entered the hospital.
can you get visual? - No.
thermal imaging registers multiple heat signatures in the facility.
which room?
I don't know.
come on, we got to keep moving.
they'll get reinforcements soon. We will not be able to hold them off.
I'm not leaving her.
Alex, grenade. - I see it.
no. Larissa, no.
we have to move.
no cover.
we can't take 'em in one strike.
she's got another man in that van.
we need a flanking team to set up a crossfire.
but we don't have 'em.
I'll handle the soldiers. You take the van.
you can't take them all on, not by yourself.
I'm not gonna take 'em on.
check it out. Don't go far.
no more stalling.
don't-- don't try to talk.
it's the life we've chosen.
it's the
the scan's all clear.
no hidden bombs or gas pouches.
I guess Amanda knew better than to turn you into a party pinata.
you okay? You zonked out during the exam.
it's been a long last few days.
how you doing?
neck's a little stiff. I think I slept on it wrong.
you were probably talking to her, weren't you?
I'm fine.
she pass?
with flying colors.
she's the same old Alex.
you sure you're okay?
you had me worried there.
Yeah.
if anything, I feel better than ever.
listen, there's something Owen said about us.
there's nothing Owen could have said about us that I don't already know.
and what I know is you had my back.
Nikita didn't.
she had a mission.
she always has a mission...
her mission.
come here.
why didn't you tell me? - You wouldn't have listened.
so you kept me out of the loop?
it wasn't my call, but for the record, I think Ryan was right.
it was a bit risky, and we could have lost everything.
I could have lost everything.
you know, say what you will about Ari, but in the end, he's one of Amanda's victims.
and if we're not in the business of saving people from Amanda's cruelty, then what are we doing, Michael?
I told him I would save him, and he knew he was lost.
Alex left.
and we lost.
I'll be in Ops.
so...
so...
I just want to say, job well done.
look, I know we had some differences over tactics, but we got Alex back, and we recovered the Black Box.
and I cannot argue with those results.
you guys really do make a great team.
a mutiny.
I was afraid something like this would happen when you told everybody about Danforth.
I did this.
Alex, you told 300 trained killers the government has a gun to their head.
not all of them want to stick around to see what happens next.
Rachel, we need to lay low.
division will never get shut down.
we are going to get there, Chris.
we are going to be free.
Rachel says that she's the leader, but that isn't true.
if Division is left standing, more people are going to die.
give me the gun.
the plan will still work. - How?
you're going to have to take the fall.
make it look like you took my gun.
I should have been here.
look at him.
you say you're trying to help the people in here?
that's all Ryan was ever trying to do
help you, get you guys a new life.
look at him!
Rachel, I know you're scared, but this isn't the old Division.
cooperate, and there's still a way out for you.
tell us who you're working with.
we know you had help trying to blow the tracker array, and someone tried to get you out of interrogation.
when you shot Ryan.
so give us a name before anyone else gets hurt.
you got me. It's over.
Oh, this is nowhere near over.
she won't break.
well, maybe it's time Nikita used some enhanced measures.
she did with Ari.
Ari was an enemy. Rachel's one of us.
not anymore.
Rachel's just the tip of the iceberg.
the only reason that she is in here is because a lot of other people feel the same way that she does.
even if we hunt her friends down, it will not solve the problem.
so you're saying you agree with her?
I'm saying I understand her.
this is Ops.
we're getting some flash traffic that I think you need to see.
agent Harris: Emergency alert.
death confirmed.
it's Danforth.
he's dead.
if you're just joining us, this is a breaking story.
commander Evan Danforth, special advisor to the President, has died.
he collapsed earlier today at a Georgetown restaurant.
preliminary reports indicate a ruptured brain aneurysm.
brain aneurysm?
it's hard to diagnose. It's easy to fake.
right out of the Division playbook, which means- - Amanda.
Amanda? Why would she kill Danforth?
because he was shielding us from the President.
only after you blackmailed him.
Nikita played the only card we had.
the point is is Amanda found out about this.
she knows, by killing Danforth, it would turn the heat up on Division.
Owen called it in. He's been surveilling Danforth.
Owen, where are you?
I'm on site.
they're taking the body out right now.
did you see anything out of the ordinary?
no. He was at the same place he had lunch at every day.
same table, same time. Just like clockwork.
once she knew his routine, it was easy.
Amanda saw the pattern, and she exploited a weakness.
we dropped the ball on surveillance.
surveillance.
when Alex and I broke into Danforth's house, we left some surveillance equipment there
phone taps, keystroke loggers. The feds do a sweep, they're going to find it.
Yeah, but they won't be able to trace that back to Division.
if the President learns there's unidentified tech in Danforth's place, she'll know that we're behind it.
she'll think we watched him, then killed him.
Owen, I need you to get to Danforth's place and clean the scene.
you want the quick version, or the full works?
the full works, but also quick.
copy that.
the President's going to want to talk to Ryan about this.
what are we supposed to do when she calls?
say Ryan lost his voice? He's on extended vacation?
no. We tell her the truth.
we tell her that Ryan's been in an accident but that he's expected to make a full recovery.
until then...
you're in charge.
she trusted a Navy man to manage Division before.
she can do it again.
you think that'll be enough to keep her finger off the SEAL trigger?
commander DANFORTH'S APARTMENT - 3: 15 P. M.
ops, we have a problem.
no response.
I'm going out there. - Take a team.
don't worry. It's just a mild paralytic.
I wouldn't want you to end up like poor commander Danforth.
unlike him, you're far more valuable alive, aren't you, Owen?
or should I say "Sam"?
you still alive? Sam?
Owen, are you okay?
what happened?
you called in, said there was a problem, and then radio silence.
where are they?
who's they?
I mean Danforth.
Danforth's dead. You don't remember?
it's been over an hour since you called in.
what? - My name.
first special forces operational detachment Delta.
I remember.
what's happening to him?
he suffered a concussion, and it looks like it's causing his brain to rewire sections that were previously damaged.
and that's what's bringing his memories back?
essentially.
it's rare, but it's been known to happen.
you need to relax.
I'm fine. I'm fine.
were you attacked?
was somebody already there?
no. Nobody was there.
it's like I had a seizure or something.
I must have hit my head on the floor when I fell.
it's a good thing we recovered you when we did.
the CIA got to Danforth's place right after Nikita pulled you out of there.
they find anything? - No, no, no.
we finished cleaning the place.
Birkhoff's hacking their system just to make sure, but I'm going to go see how he's doing.
you should take it easy.
thank you, Captain Obvious.
still hurt? - No.
I had worse hangovers in the army.
when you were Sam.
Yeah.
so it really is coming back.
in flashes, like a strobe light.
I remember my unit going down. I was hit.
and Amanda?
do you remember why she tried to wipe your memories in the first place?
no.
there has to be a reason why she did this to you.
we figure that out, we can find out why she tried to grab you back in Russia.
what the hell are you doing?
they were worried you might have been followed.
they?
how's Rachel?
she's holding up.
but for how long?
this is Division. They are going to break her.
even if they don't, once Ryan wakes up, he'll I. D. you as the shooter.
let me worry about that. The plan is still on track.
we get everyone new identities and money to start new lives, then we get out.
Rachel too. All of us.
we're going to have to do something about the trackers.
Birkhoff's decentralized the entire array, so we can't just take out one server to bring down the system.
that means we need software access to bring the trackers down.
we'll never get that.
let me handle it. - How?
Birkhoff is the only one who has access to those systems.
I told you that I will handle Birkhoff.
nerd, we need you.
I'm busy here. - This is important.
Yeah, well, I'm trying to make sure that if the rabble rousers in our midst launch another attack, they don't bring down our whole network.
is it more important than that?
this could lead to Amanda.
okay, what is it?
check any records on Sam Matthews.
your alter ego? I already did.
Mikey filled me in.
there is no trace of any Delta operative by that name.
Amanda must have wiped your file.
did a thorough job too.
usually there are some digital echoes left behind, but with Owen or Sam, whatever your name is--nada.
try Ray Kramer, Enrique Morales, and Darren Stoffer.
who are they? - Members of my old unit.
we were in Kosovo.
the guys in my unit were smuggling heroin.
I caught them.
and, they shot me.
I was able to take them all down.
I killed them all.
Amanda was right. I killed all my friends.
bingo.
army special Ops, assigned to support NATO peacekeepers in the Balkans.
all listed as killed in a helicopter crash in Kosovo in '99.
division cover story much?
looks like there was one survivor
a corporal Scott Atkins.
you remember him?
he tried to help when the others turned against me.
honorably discharged in '05.
last known address is in Baltimore.
all right, looks like you're going to visit an old friend.
first we blackmailed him, and then we kill him?
president's not going to like this.
Hey, Michael.
people are jittery, worried about what Danforth's death means.
well, they know he was ready to kill us all.
they also stood here and watched us as we blackmailed him.
they don't know what to think.
is this good for us, is it bad?
well, this couldn't have happened at a worse possible time.
all right, everyone, listen up.
stop what you're doing.
first, we had nothing to do with Danforth's death.
this wasn't some sort of covert kill, and second, this changes nothing.
the President is aware of our situation and is committed to letting us see our mission through.
so I'm here to tell you that everything is under control.
we just need to focus and keep doing our jobs.
now, as you were.
are you serious?
tell me you haven't thought about it.
Birkhoff, you're the only person I can talk to about this.
I know what you mean.
Nikita, Mikey, Ryan-- they're too close to it. They can't see it.
so you'd really leave Division?
why not?
every mission leads to another.
every secret leads to ten more.
Ryan's in a coma, and for what?
because we have an obligation to clean up somebody else's mess?
I haven't told anybody this, but right after you alerted the troops to the seal threat,
I asked Sonya to leave here with me.
what did she say?
she turned her back on me and walked out the door.
she's right. I'd be letting Nikki down.
I'd be leaving a lot of people in the lurch.
what if you didn't have to? Leave them?
what do you mean?
michael asked me to check those new security protocols.
you finish?
Yeah, sure.
did I interrupt something?
no.
BALTIMDRE, MARYLAND
looks like your friend had a really rough time since leaving the army.
I'd probably be in worse shape than him if it wasn't for you.
you always knew what was best for me, didn't you?
yeah? What's it about?
Hey, Scotty. Been a long time.
Sam?
no. Can't be. You're dead!
we're not here to hurt you.
you don't know me like he does.
the nice thing about killing a drug dealer is they always tend to have what you need to erase the job.
Owen, something's happened to you.
let me help.
you already helped.
you found Scotty for me.
you said he was your friend.
he was.
Amanda was wrong when she said I killed all my friends.
one got away.
not anymore.
Owen, let me go.
I'll help you fix this.
there's nothing to fix.
I remember now.
everything.
my unit was smuggling drugs, but I wasn't the whistle-blower.
I was the leader.
I organized the whole operation, but they tried to cut me out.
what the hell?
Sam. This isn't what it looks like.
good.
cause it looks like you're moving product without me, and I know you wouldn't do that.
right, guys?
no way.
we just intercepted an unscheduled delivery.
don't worry.
you'll get what's coming to you.
you still alive?
Scotty's mistake was not finishing the job.
you get a man down, you finish him.
else it's going to bite you in the ass.
it might not happen right away, it might take ten years, but it's going to happen eventually.
am I right, Scotty?
operator. How may I assist you?
you can shut up.
I'm talking to the bitch who's tapping this phone.
call me back.
let's talk Nikita.
Amanda.
once she restored my memory, she knew I'd come looking for Atkins.
I half thought I'd find her in the house.
Owen's a tool.
no, Amanda did this to you.
she created some kind of... delusion.
I don't know, but this isn't you.
you don't get it, do you?
Owen was the delusion.
he was just a whipped, little puppy dog following you around.
I mean, it felt like I was medicated for the last ten years. - Why would Amanda do that?
why would she create someone like Owen?
you are so obsessed with that woman, aren't you?
okay.
from what I remember, according to Percy, the perfect candidate for Division was a troubled, violent killer with low self-esteem.
does that remind you of anybody?
I mean, they didn't want thinkers, planners, leaders.
they wanted to do all the thinking for themselves.
so Amanda, being Amanda, took her little needles and blunted my edge.
something about judgment centers around the brain.
take a born leader, and turn him into a loyal follower.
a guardian.
no.
no.
you can't tell me the man that I know
the one who saved my life, the one who loved Emily
that that man doesn't exist?
Emily didn't know who I was.
I didn't know who I was.
if she knew, she wouldn't have been with me.
this is Sam.
it's been a long time.
I have to admit, I thought you might call Atkins before killing him.
you're moving a bit faster than I expected.
had a lot of time to make up for.
meet me at Ellwood Park at midnight.
and why would I do that?
same reason you're tapping this phone.
you knew I'd come with what you want.
be prepared to pay cause it's going to cost you.
you're not really going to go through with this.
you can fight her. I can help you.
Oh, she'll get what's coming to her, after I get mine.
you're not really surprised this is who I am, are you?
I mean...
deep inside, you always knew what I was.
you just didn't want to believe it.
Where's the bad cop?
no bad cops.
I'm here as a friend.
yeah?
then let me go.
that's up to you.
tell me who else you're working with.
you know, your Division record was outstanding
five sanctioned solo kills, seven missions as team leader, all clean successes.
except for that last one in Madrid.
what happened there?
a member of your exfil squad went down.
your orders were to leave him, but you went back for him, got caught in the crossfire.
said you spent three months recovering in medical from those bullet wounds.
now, you know what it means to be responsible for the lives of your people, and I am telling you that your friends are following a very dangerous path.
if you give me their names, they'll be fine.
my friends will be fine when they are free.
but we both know that's not how it's going to end.
division will come after you, with or without a tracker, and this time, it won't be to put you into custody.
it will be to kill you, to kill all of you.
that is how this is going to end.
so...
are you really going to let that happen?
if I gave you access to the server, could you reroute tracker control?
not with Birkhoff's security protocols in place.
you have to disable those first from his station.
what happened? I thought you were taking care of him.
still working on it. - There is another way.
take control of Ops. Ryan's out of commission.
Nikita's off on one of her personal missions.
we have a window here.
out of the question. - You heard Michael.
he thinks it's business as usual.
nothing is going to change unless we do something about it.
we don't have the numbers.
we can get the numbers.
word is spreading fast. - No!
no more recruiting people until we get a handle on this tracker problem.
we've got to be smart, wait for our moment.
I will get everyone out, safely.
check him.
he's clean.
and you're stupid.
what's the matter?
you don't have a plan for this?
that was unnecessary.
seemed necessary to me.
you got the money?
what's this?
50000
that's it?
I get you Nikita, you think it's worth 50 grand?
this is what's going to happen.
I'm going to give you a bank account number, and you're going to transfer all of your funds into it.
the entire Tasarov bankroll. You understand?
there is no more bankroll. That's all of it.
my goal was never money.
sucks to be you.
there's another way.
the Black Box.
a lot of people would pay for its secrets, a lot more than $50, 000, and right now, there's a small window of time where Division still thinks you're Owen.
you could go back and get it.
that's not a bad angle. Thanks.
but who would you sell it to?
I have all the contacts.
your only avenue to them is through me.
I'm going to be so happy when I'm done with you people.
wait for my call.
what about Nikita?
any progress with Rachel?
not yet, but I think I'm starting to get through to her.
Michael, it's Owen.
Owen? What happened?
Amanda was waiting for us.
I tried to fight them off, but there was too many of 'em.
what about Nikita?
Amanda has her.
is there an active threat on site?
no, they cleared out.
all right, stay put. I'll bring an Alpha team.
all right.
Michael, Amanda must have a plan for her.
she'll keep her alive.
Yeah, but for how long?
I'm taking an Alpha team out there.
you stay here and start the sweep.
check the satellites, the cell towers, traffic cams, all of it.
Birkhoff, give Alex full command code clearance.
you're in charge.
how do you like my new lair?
it somehow suits you.
I'd been hoping you'd come by for a visit.
Sam just made that happen sooner than expected.
remember what I said?
you told me that the people I love would betray me, but you had to destroy Owen's mind.
you had to turn him into a completely different person for him to betray me.
that's not winning, that's cheating.
I'm not talking about Owen.
I was very specific, remember?
what did I say about her?
you said that...
you made her, and like everything you love
she will turn against you.
which is exactly what Alex has done, with a little help from me of course.
Dana found some traffic cam footage that could be Amanda.
it's grainy, inconclusive. Can you help her?
Yeah, no sweat.
I got a new full-spectrum analysis process, should clean it up.
where is she? - Logistics.
with Owen, the solution was to build a wall.
a bit crude, I admit, but the memory wipe did its job.
with Alex, I needed a more elegant method.
Alex is still Alex. She remembers who she is.
that's because this time, I didn't need a wall.
what I needed was a bridge.
Alex is a survivor, and like most survivors, she carries the guilt of that.
her father died. She lived.
she had escaped the world of sex slavery but left many girls behind to suffer.
I needed to connect the pain of her past with her present circumstances in Division, so I introduced her to someone who could link those two worlds.
look out!
Larissa?
the girl she was trying to save?
a hallucination.
during her stay with me, Alex thought she was in a bed when she was really in my chair.
larissa was an idea I projected into Alex's mind
an innocent young woman who had lost everything, still working for the people who killed her family.
parallels, anyone?
I stimulated the empathetic regions of her brain, gave her a few suggestions.
you can't leave now, Alex.
Larissa's hurt.
she needs your help.
let me see. - Let me see.
keep pressure on it.
keep pressure on it.
her own mind filled in the rest of the story.
she blamed me for Larissa's death.
transference.
Alex survived but couldn't save Larissa.
that feeling of being powerless, she needed someone to blame.
who else but the most powerful figure in her life?
you.
no.
Alex has defeated your mind games before.
she's a good person.
she's not going to forget that.
and I wouldn't want her to...
read-only RESTRCIONS APPLY
because there's no telling how far Alex will go to save the people who depend on her.
command APRVILEQES RECOGNIZED
she will sacrifice everything before letting them die like Larissa.
security PROTOCOLS DEACTIVRTED
everything.
all you can do is sit there and wait for it to happen.
Owen, are you okay?
you're lucky Amanda left you alive.
I wasn't the target.
once she got Nikita, she was gone.
Birkhoff, any leads?
none yet, but I got everybody in here on the hunt.
come on, I'll catch you up on where we are.
shouldn't you be in medical?
in a minute. I had a thought.
that's a new one.
What'd you say to me?
easy. It's a joke.
of course.
what's your thought?
I think Amanda might be making a play for the Black Box.
you mean like another trade? Nikita for the box?
maybe.
or she's got a mole inside that could use the distraction to steal it outright.
impossible.
it's in Ryan's safe with a biometric lock, and considering Ryan's condition right now,
I don't think anybody's going to be getting in there anytime soon.
charming as ever.
the thing is, I hated Percy, but I got him.
you were either valuable, or you were dead.
simple as that.
but you?
you poke around in people's heads for fun.
you manipulate who they become.
I help them become what they should have been.
I fix what was broken.
this is important work we're doing.
did someone fix you?
or was the problem that you were too broken for them to even bother?
I didn't need anyone to fix me.
I did that for myself.
well, I couldn't.
I needed help-- your help.
and I passed on what I learned from you to Alex.
I thought you didn't make Alex. You made a point of saying that.
I didn't remake Alex in my own image. I didn't need to do that.
she already was me, lying on the floor, trying to kill herself, believing that she was worthless because she had nothing to live for.
I saw that, and I thought...
I could help her.
because you used to be her.
and you used to be me.
transference, right?
that's what this is all about.
you're trying to break me the way someone broke you.
though, when the people you loved betrayed you, I'm doubting there was a cranial needle involved.
I have a feeling they made that move of their own free will.
what's wrong?
I think someone's been using my terminal.
did they do anything?
no. Critical systems are all secure.
they'd need command code access to get into those anyway.
I told these doofuses to stay off my station.
Sean? What are you doing?
I was going to ask you the same question.
where are you going?
I don't have to explain myself.
Sean, wait!
what am I going to find in here, Alex?
let's just go upstairs, and I'll explain everything.
you've been different ever since South Ossetia.
aggressive, secretive.
this again? I told you
you and Rachel were the only ones in the room when Ryan got shot, and...
I saw you use your command code clearance at Birkhoff's station.
it's you, isn't it? Behind this whole mutiny?
it's not a mutiny, Sean. You don't understand.
you're right, I don't.
I have to do this. - Why?
if I don't get everyone out of Division, more people are going to get hurt.
you mean like Ryan.
help us. - What?
you're the one who always said how dangerous this place is, how I had to get out of here.
that was about you.
and what about everyone else?
we have a chance to save them, Sean.
all of them.
are they down here?
how many of them are there?
more than enough.
Chris, back off!
he knows too much. He could expose us all.
he isn't going to say anything.
he's with us.
find that hard to believe.
how did you get out?
people are joining our cause from all over, including security.
Rachel, listen to me. Sean is helping us.
who do you think shut down the trackers?
the trackers are down?
not yet, but when Michael went off-site, he put Sean in charge.
Sean used his clearance to bypass security protocols.
we can access them at any time now.
division's responsible for my mother's death.
you think I have any loyalty to this place?
you know what this means?
now's the time.
what are you talking about?
we're going to take Ops.
we have the numbers.
and if the tracker server really is vulnerable, we can strike now before Birkhoff or anyone else can turn the security protocols back on.
we don't need to do this.
I can still get everyone out quietly and safely.
we go in there, guns blazing, it'll be a bloodbath.
it'll be their blood. - This is not the plan!
the plan has changed.
we're getting everyone out, tonight!
Hello, there. It's been a long time.
going somewhere?
following up on a hunch.
is that why you visited Ryan first?
his guards have orders to report all entries.
the first thing that bothered me was, why would Amanda take Nikita and not you?
then, Birkhoff told me about your Black Box theory, and I thought, that's...funny...
how you never mentioned that to me.
Yeah. What can I say?
memory's not my strong suit.
take him to holding.
I said- - you're not in charge anymore.
excuse me?
what?
I'm on your side.
what do you think I was just doing?
keep your head down until this is over.
until it's over?
no, no, no, no, I'm going to get out of here right now.
no one leaves until we've secured the facility.
everyone, stand down!
we're taking charge.
what?
stop!
stop! No shooting!
no one needs to get hurt.
we have Michael in custody, and we control the exits.
all right. Disable the trackers, and transfer the money.
once that is done, then we can get everyone out.
no.
we also have to make sure they can never come after us because they will.
attention, Division personnel.
there's been a change in leadership.
ops is now under the control of those who want to get out of this hellhole.
those who are with us will get new lives, free of Division forever.
those who are against us, they will be shot on sight.
it's your choice.
Rachel, what are you doing?
what needs to be done.
we have a problem.
hold on. I think you should hear this.
go ahead.
there's been a coup in Division.
they've taken over Ops, instituted a lockdown.
I have the Black Box, but I can't get out.
you're resourceful.
I'm sure you'll find a way. Good luck.
so it begins.
you think you can just break everyone out of here and run for it?
all of you? - Get in.
look, whatever you think is going on up there, I am willing to bet Amanda is behind it.
she's got Nikita- - Amanda's nowhere near this.
Alex started this, and we're gonna finish it.
Alex?
your new identity.
for the rest of your life.
thank you.
this is your numbered account and your severance share.
transfer TO ACCOUNT COMPLETE
merry Christmas.
once everyone gets their cut, we will release the lockdown, throw open the doors, and kiss this place good-bye for good.
you gotta do something.
you need to retake control from Rachel, make the rest of them listen.
listen to what?
the truth.
the government's never gonna let 300 former convicts turned assassins just disappear without the President's approval.
now look, if you take charge, we can free Michael and restore order.
but you need to make them stop following Rachel.
I thought you were on board with this.
no, that was just so the angry villagers wouldn't tear me to pieces.
Alex, if we run, we will be hunted for the rest of our lives.
these people are not gonna end up free.
they're gonna end up dead.
no. Not this time.
I will not let that happen again.
again? What do you mean "again"?
this time,
we have to shut down the trackers.
that way, they'll never find us.
tell that to the rogue agents we've already caught.
they cut out their trackers, and we still found them.
you may be right.
I know I am.
Rachel, I need to talk to you.
not now. - Yes now.
if there is any hope of us surviving past today, we have to disable Shadownet.
say what?
it's too powerful.
it has backdoor access to almost every major law enforcement grid in the world.
it can access security cams around the world.
if we leave it in Division, someone can use it to find us.
and you're the only one who can shut it down.
escort Birkhoff to the server room and get it done.
let's go. - Okay, all right.
Hey. - All right.
Sonya will continue the account transfers.
Alex, what the hell?
I'm sorry, Sean, but I can't let you stop us.
No! Stop!
look, just because he's not on board doesn't mean he's a threat.
he's just having second thoughts.
there is no going back. You said so yourself.
that doesn't mean we have to turn on each other.
nobody needs to get hurt.
take him to holding.
Hey, this will all work out, trust me.
I did.
the objective was to use Alex's survivor's guilt.
that's why she's so obsessed with making sure everyone in Division gets out of there alive, even if they end up killing themselves in the process.
that place is going to tear itself apart.
don't bet on it. - I wouldn't.
if not for Ryan in a coma and Michael locked in a cell.
I wouldn't bet on it if you were there.
but you're here.
Oh, if you're gonna keep talking, Amanda, just kill me now.
not yet.
or ever.
you can't kill me. You don't want to.
you've had so many chances.
as have you, and you couldn't pull the trigger.
I didn't want to kill anyone. I never did.
that's what you didn't understand.
always so superior.
time for your final lesson.
shadownet
critical DATA LOSS.
all right, there. You happy?
Shadownet's down. Little birds can fly free.
if you ask me, you're all a bunch of honey badgers.
it's really gone?
Oh, it's never gonna be gone.
shadownet not here.
shadownet here.
and here.
that's true.
as long as you're around, Division will always be able to track us.
you ever kill anyone, Chris?
no.
but how hard can it be?
it's harder than you think.
believe me.
all right, kiddies.
Christmas is over.
Santa's done giving presents.
firewall ENGRAGED
the place is on lockdown, and I can't get out.
and what do you propose I do about it?
send goons or mercs or whatever.
have 'em attack the outer perimeter and create a diversion.
that way, I can get out of here with the Black Box you told me to get.
your plan's a bit crude.
you got a better idea?
the elevators have an emergency override.
they can be triggered from the server room.
go trigger it.
that's it? - That's it.
now, if you'll excuse me, I'm being rude to my guest.
what did you do to me?
nothing permanent.
I just needed to stimulate certain visualization centers in your brain.
south Ossetia special.
you gonna make me see...
an imaginary room with a fake girl?
no. The people you meet won't be fictitious.
major Matthew Collins, neuropsychiatrist, and his daughter, circa 1987.
the room is 8x10, green dresser against peach walls.
pink flowered pillows on an unmade bed.
a mirror on the door.
sorry I'm late. I got stuck at work talking to pencil pushers.
but I picked up some dinner.
why don't you set the table while I wash up?
Amanda, I've had a very hard day.
now is not the time to push me.
so please, do as you're asked and set the table.
I'm Amanda.
I'm Amanda.
in Geneva, you demanded I tell you what made me.
be careful what you wish for.
we didn't have much, but we didn't need a lot.
the army provided for most things.
and daddy, well, he wasn't one for decorating.
except for those ducks.
he was always obsessed with those damn ducks.
they forgot your salad. I'm running back to get it.
it was about as ordinary as you could get.
what is all this?
isn't it obvious?
you wanted to know how it all started.
well, this is where I grew up.
so you're gonna show me that a hard life is an excuse for what you've become?
it isn't. So just skip to the end.
I can't skip to the end.
how this ends is up to you.
I'm trying to tell you what I remember of my life at that time.
and thanks to the psychotropic procedures I've perfected, you're able to simulate your own vision of it.
I'm just providing the framework for the story, but your own mind is filling in the details.
and your own choices.
I'll set the stage, but what happens here is determined by you.
it's similar to what I did to Alex in South Ossetia, except she didn't know it was all in her head.
I'm granting you the gift of self-awareness.
if you want to reveal to me your deepest, darkest secrets, Amanda, cut the theatrics.
no.
this is something you need to feel, not just hear.
it's the only way you'll learn you know nothing about who can and can't be saved.
who is that?
get out.
are you okay?
I said, get out!
he's not here.
he went out.
Oh, what did he do to you?
Amanda, please.
you know if father finds you in here, he's going to blame me.
and then he's gonna up the dosage, and then-- and then
no, no, no, no, no, I'm not gonna let that happen, because I'm gonna help you.
Oh, you're gonna help me?
daddy's little princess?
you can't help me!
or can you, Nikita?
when can we get out of here?
when are we getting our money?
please, just be patient.
Sonya, what's the holdup?
division's accounts are more secure than we thought.
a firewall I've never seen before just sprang up.
everything's frozen.
Chris, come in.
server room. Let's go.
Charlie, get that firewall down and free up the money.
Yes, ma'am.
ops.
I want two-man teams sweeping the entire facility.
find Birkhoff and bring him down.
wait a minute!
don't tell me No one needs to get hurt.
this?
this is not like Birkhoff.
I know him. He's not a killer.
I think Vince would beg to differ.
there's got to be more to the story.
look, he didn't shoot Chris.
no, just smashed his face.
I guess he was having second thoughts.
hands! Don't move!
bring him in!
Owen? What are you doing here?
story of my life.
I was getting a little stir-crazy waiting for my severance package.
didn't know you guys had a curfew or
look, I don't want any trouble, okay?
I just want to follow the conga line out like everybody else.
we didn't do this. Birkhoff did.
post guards near every terminal.
that's how he'll come at us.
you okay?
Birkhoff?
damn.
Owen, please.
I need you to find him before this gets worse.
can he really hack into any terminal in Division?
what matters is that they're gonna kill him, and I can't let that happen.
okay, okay, okay. Okay. Okay. - Look, I gotta get back to Ops, but I don't
dial it down.
I'll find him.
something's not right.
she's not right, I'm telling you.
I saw it.
Amanda did something to her.
are you listening to me?
Yeah, she attacked Nikita and Owen, but she left Owen behind.
that's not very Amanda of her.
and since then, even before then, Owen's been off the rails.
okay, so are you saying that she did a number on him too?
it's the only way to explain it.
explain what?
Owen stole the Black Box, and then he attacked me after I caught him trying to sneak away.
to where? Back to Amanda?
she didn't grab Nikita. He did.
Owen gave her up. They're in this together.
Hey, look, I know you want to find your girl, but the only way you get to her is if I get through to mine.
we have to convince Alex to let us out of here.
Derek, call up to Ops.
we've got something Alex is gonna want to hear.
you're gonna have to try harder than that.
tell her it's about the Black Box and the agent roster on it.
she'll listen.
ops, come in.
daddy's work was brilliant. Far ahead of its time.
the army knew that post-traumatic stress was going to continue being a problem, so they commissioned him to find a treatment.
but he didn't want to just treat PTSD, he wanted to prevent it.
he searched for a way to split the moral judgment centers in the brain so that a soldier could engage in the horrors of war, and with the flip of a switch, return home and be a normal citizen.
the emotional scars would be locked safely away.
the military refused to allow him to conduct clinical trials, so he decided to do them on his own.
on his own daughter?
well, that's how much he believed in what he was doing.
it was a sacrifice, but that's the benefit of having twins.
you can use one as a control.
Amanda! - You're hurting her!
Amanda, stop it!
you know you cannot interfere.
what are you thinking?
you risk contaminating the study.
this isn't a study. She's your daughter!
and Helen knows how important this is.
I thought you did too.
now, we've talked about this.
this is..."Important work we're doing.
look, it's too dangerous to play games right now.
this is no game.
they told me you said something about the Black Box.
that's right.
all this trouble you're going through to give everyone a new life?
their identities are on it.
the entire Division roster.
Yes, yes. I stopped by Ryan's office on my way down here.
the safe is open. The box is gone.
maybe we should talk about this in private?
don't do that.
do what?
why are you so jumpy?
this place has gone all Crimson Tide, or are you late to the party, as usual?
why don't you give me the gun before you hurt yourself?
all right, we gotta get to a terminal, hack the holding cell, and bounce Mikey out of there.
system override on the elevators, can you do that from anywhere?
Owen, what's wrong with you?
Sam. The name is Sam.
now answer the question.
Yeah, yes.
yeah? - Yeah.
okay, let's go.
it's right around here. There it is.
she said Birkhoff can override doors and elevators from here.
at ease, ladies. I found him.
agent double-oh-zero.
do your thing. Don't get cute.
security
access - What the hell did you do? - Nothing.
you may now approach the elevators in an orderly fashion.
they're out!
all right, enough!
let's get out of here.
I know this is confusing for you.
you hear those awful sounds coming from downstairs.
but you need to know that's not Helen you hear.
that's someone else.
a part of Helen's mind I've created.
and if I succeed with my work, your sister will never remember any of what's happened.
if you succeed.
when I succeed.
maybe you're scared because you don't understand my work.
if you were more involved, if you could see for yourself...
how truly amazing these results really are,
I could accomplish so much more with an assistant as brilliant as you.
you want me to follow in your footsteps?
I knew you'd understand.
you were always the smart one, Amanda.
now, I need to get back to work.
but I think you should get out of the house.
call one of your friends.
go to the mall.
buy yourself some clothes.
so this is where it began...
all the manipulation and... the experimentation...
destroying people's lives.
you gave up on your sister.
you chose your daddy over her.
I won't make that choice.
I won't make that choice.
watch me.
when are you ever going to learn?
don't.
let me go!
I love you.
what do you feel? - Stop it.
do you love me? - This isn't about us.
I'm making this about us.
there are two sides in this, and you need to choose.
me or the mutiny? - No.
if we stay inside Division, we die.
that's not true.
they died, Sean, and I lived.
Alex, look at me.
Alex, look.
she did something to you.
Amanda did something to you in South Ossetia.
Sean, we need to move!
I thought you said it was close.
they should be.
they?
damn it.
go ahead, pull the trigger.
come on, you heard the man.
I can't.
cause I'm the only one that knows where Nikita is.
go away.
we're getting out of here.
you're crazy. - We can leave tonight.
he'll find us, and then he'll punish me.
no. I need you to trust me.
trust you to do what?
where are we gonna go...
two runaways without a dime?
we can go to the police.
we'll tell them what he's done.
Oh, and you think that they'll believe us?
I don't go to school.
I don't have a license.
the state doesn't even have birth records of me.
father made sure that I don't officially exist!
the best thing that could happen to me is I end up in a place like this.
is that what you want, Amanda?
so you never have to think of me again?
let me help you.
please.
I'm just so tired of it.
the tests.
the experiments, the pain.
please.
Amanda, make it stop.
I will.
you will?
Oh, I promise.
then please...
you have to kill me.
it's not an easy choice, is it?
because she really wants to die.
so you killed her? Your own sister?
I did what I thought I had to do.
but it's your turn now.
I'm not going to do it.
then you will live with the results, because I'll tell you this:
and you will be responsible for the consequences that follow.
are you starting to believe me now?
not everyone can be saved.
now there's three of them on the loose: Michael, Birkhoff, and Sean.
if you find them unarmed, shoot on sight.
No!
we start killing each other, and we're lost.
we didn't start this. Chris?
Birkhoff got the jump on me in the server room.
he took my gun and shot down Vincent in cold blood.
he would have killed me too but said I needed to live to pass on the message that no one will survive tonight.
No! No! There's no way he said that.
does anyone here believe this?
just finish the damn transfers.
Rachel, listen to me.
no, you listen to me.
most of us will get out of here tonight.
your pals made a different choice.
they stashed the Black Box somewhere.
with our real identities on it.
we need to find where it is. - No, we don't.
it can burn down with the rest of this place.
What'd you think? We'd leave it standing?
you can't save everyone, Alex.
go on, guys. Get to it.
too bad Amanda won't be getting her prize.
wasn't for her.
I was using her to sell it to the highest bidder.
she's the one who told you you could override the elevators, isn't she?
I knew you didn't come up with it.
you got a big mouth when my gun isn't in it.
let's see yours.
Birkhoff, we need to get topside.
will the hack still work?
it should. - Good, let's go.
we can't, not all of us. - Why not?
once the hack's open, I gotta stay with it, make sure the kids in Ops don't shut it down.
otherwise, you guys could get stuck between floors.
well, I'm not leaving you behind.
well, I'm not leaving without Sonya.
so there.
I got goose bumps.
shut up. - There's a panel nearby.
I can hack it in 30 seconds.
Michael, you go.
I'm not leaving Alex behind, and I can't let Birkhoff be braver than me.
let's go.
come on, come on. Let's go, Birkhoff.
I'm moving as fast as I can.
hurry it up, man. - I'm hurrying.
all right.
work faster.
at least give me a gun.
no way.
but you can take this back.
it's gonna get hot in a second.
if I'm gonna get Nikita back, I'm gonna need you and that in one piece.
so stay low and stay quiet.
soon as the elevator doors open, I'll push them off.
my hero.
get that elevator back down here!
surface REACHED
destination: AUTO BAY
he's out! Mikey's out!
so am I!
come on.
what about Michael?
Birkhoff hacked the elevator, so he could escape.
took Owen with him. - Owen?
they had the Black Box.
that's got the whole roster on it.
our new identities will be useless.
should've thought about that before you tried to whack me in the server room.
I knew it.
no, please. No, no, no, no, no.
you think I wanna hunt you?
you think I want the government to hunt you? - No, please.
no, you were Percy's little stooge.
and then Nikita. And then Ryan.
you're management, and this has been a long time coming.
No!
stop! Stop! Enough!
it's over! Can't you see that?
just 'cause they're dead doesn't mean we stay.
you can't kill all of us.
you wanna go?
go!
what are you looking at me for?
I don't give the orders around here!
you wanna stay? Stay!
you wanna go?
go.
Helen, come on, we're going.
I told you... - I don't care.
we're getting out of here. Let's go.
why is she out of her room?
you're not gonna hurt her anymore.
I'm disappointed in you, Amanda.
I thought we had an understanding.
you, back downstairs.
now!
I told you, get back to your room.
No! No!
I could have gotten us out.
Why?
daddy's princess has to ask why?
why I wanted to hurt someone who kept saying that they were gonna help me, but waited and did nothing for years.
you knew what was happening downstairs, but you let me suffer.
and why?
because I was born eight minutes later than you?
I could have been you.
I should have been you!
father did me a favor, because Helen doesn't exist...
but Amanda does.
you're Amanda.
I told you I was so much worse than all you bitches put together.
you were Helen...
the whole time.
your sister tried to help you, and you killed her?
she tried to save herself.
she couldn't bear the guilt of how she... stood by, did nothing, told no one.
she thought that if she saved me, it would absolve her of everything.
sound familiar?
you see Alex as living proof that you can be redeemed, but the truth is you can't.
you can't really save people, can you?
you slaughtered your family.
you had the freedom to make your own choices, and the story ended up the same.
no, your lesson means nothing.
for now.
but soon, you will know the truth of it.
you did something to me while I was out.
what did you do?
I used our time together wisely.
what did you do to me?
I thought I'd never make it out of that freaking hellhole.
kind of in the middle of something here.
we had a deal.
time to hold up your end.
fine, just let me finish, and then you'll get what you want.
you know what?
I've waited long enough.
now you've messed with enough people's heads.
we leave now, or I'm putting a bullet in yours.
if you shoot me, neither one of us get what we want.
just let me finish with Nikita, and then we'll go.
I can't let you do that.
don't tell me you've gone soft.
don't blame him.
I put a tracker on that box right after we got it from Ari.
now, put the box down and back away from Nikita.
and here I thought you trusted me.
Nikita. - You have to get Amanda.
she's gone.
what about the Black Box? Can we track it?
Amanda is gonna have to wait.
division?
we need to get back.
you might live to regret that, Sam.
you might not live, period.
I went through hell to get this back.
now it's your time to deliver.
I want the names of the contacts we can sell these secrets to.
I want my money.
and then I never want to see any of your faces again.
well, you're a man who seems to really know...
shut up and drive.
okay.
Sean, are you okay?
Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.
let me catch my breath.
I think I cracked a rib.
you need to go to medical.
are there even any medics left?
one. She's looking after Ryan.
Sean, there's something that I have to tell you about Ryan.
you're the one who shot him.
how did you know?
when I mentioned his name in the storage room, your reaction...
I mean, that's when I became certain that you were not the Alex I know.
I didn't mean to shoot him.
I didn't mean
I didn't mean for any of this to happen.
I-I swear I didn't.
Sean, you have to believe me.
this whole time, the thing that matters to me the most
saving everyone. I know.
no, you don't know.
I couldn't save my father.
I couldn't save Larissa.
and I-I couldn't save those girls that I left behind in the brothel.
what's done is done.
I just want my girl back.
now, help me get to medical.
you know, one thing good, I can finally use that big screen to start watching some Monday Night Football.
you got shot!
somebody, help!
I can't find an exit wound.
Where's the blood?
must be internal bleeding.
what?
I've seen this before.
bullet gets lodged in there...
and nicks a major artery.
there's nothing you can do.
No! - Alex.
promise me...
you'll find a way to get better.
no, don't think about that now.
please! Please, somebody, help!
Alex. Alex, just promise me.
I promise.
look, you were wrong before, when you said the thing that matters to me the most was saving everyone.
you were wrong.
what I was trying to say is the thing that matters to me the most is you.
this is where we first met.
No!
what happened?
is there anyone left?
a dozen or so.
you guys need to get to Ops.
this was Rachel's doing?
Yeah, he bled out internally.
Where's Alex?
she said she was gonna stay.
she was waiting for you.
when we found Sean here, she was gone.
kept saying she was trying to save everyone.
I guess, in the end, she couldn't save him.
not everyone can be saved.
my dad just gave us a lot of money for the baby's education fund.
her name is kate. She happens to be pretty special.
I had gastric bypass, and after I lost 100 pounds, this was the result.
I don't give a shit if she was once fat.
Julia met someone. You met someone.
I get it.
Ollie sounds very upper crust.
is ollie rich?
Yes, very, and it's olivia.
no, no, no, no, no.
Oh, come on. Let them out. They'll suffocate.
trust me. I'm a famous tv surgeon.
right, right, which is exactly why you should be careful because the tabloids would kill for a photo op.
of us naked in the hot tub?
Sean, I got to go.
Oh, no, you don'T.
no, no. No, I do.
I got a cramp. -Ok, ok, ok.
I promise we don't have to get naked.
wait, sean.
Oh, god.
I, uh, I drained it.
I put enough disinfectant in there to kill an outbreak of ebola, so.
honey, come on. -Don'T.
don't touch me. I can't even look at you.
I'm a doctor.
besides, this was nothing.
once you've seen your children born.
wait, wait. Hey, whoa.
are you comparing the birth of your children to me shitting in a hot tub?
maybe you've got a bug or a stomach flu.
did you eat something.
Yeah, yeah. I did. I ate something, ok?
I felt awful after doing the scene with aidan, and I tried shoving the entire catering truck down my throat.
when that didn't make me feel any better, I went over to the craft service table, and i hoovered up all the sugar cookies.
at least when you do a play, you can go to the ladies' room and vomit between acts, but, no, this is tv.
the next shot was close on my face, so I had to resort to plan "B.
you took a laxative? -Yeah, 3.
you're never going to be able to have sex with me again, are you?
Oh, for god's sake, I mean, i am a little concerned that you'd resort to pills.
it was a catch-22, ok?
I'm so dissatisfied with everything. work, my body.
so I eat.
I'm just scared.
I'm scared that I'm not gonna be satisfied till I drive away the one thing that is working.
you.
I'm not here because you're perfect.
I'm here because you're you.
human, beautiful.
and I'm satisfied with you.
whoa, tiger.
you should probably replenish your liquids.
OK.
fill her up. How about I satisfy you right now?
Mr. Poe, how long have you been a plastic surgery addict?
well, I'm hardly what you would call an addict.
Really?
let's see.
you've had two rhinoplasties to reshape the nostrils and straighten out the bone, right, a chin augmentation, two blepharoplasties, a canthoplasty to tighten up the bottom lid and give you that catlike appearance there, a brow lift, two otoplasties.
am I missing anything?
chin reduction, not augmentation.
my bad.
no. It's actually Dr. Woodman's bad.
I asked for a cleft. Do you see a cleft on me?
no. That's the one thing on your face I don't see.
it would've delineated the symmetry that I've been trying so hard to achieve.
now, that hardly makes me an addict, does it?
I mean, a perfectionist, perhaps, but in our business, that sort of goes with the territory, doesn't it?
our business? -Yes.
I own one of the top salons in beverly hills.
paragonia.
Oh, I've heard of it, home of the $800 haircut.
farmers get haircuts.
my clientele are limited to the very rich and famous. They don't come to me for haircuts.
they come to me because they know that I understand beauty is an olympic ideal.
I face a mirror all day.
every time I look up, there i am.
now, if I'm striving to make my clients pictures of perfection, then don't I owe the same obligation to myself?
and this cleft chin, it's gonna fulfill some kind of ideal?
Dr. Troy, when an a-list celebrity is thinking about getting a little work done, to whom do they turn, their maid or to someone like me who has dedicated himself body and soul to a universal standard of beauty?
so, to whom do I send my $800 haircuts?
I truly am at a loss.
OK.
so, this cleft. are we talking michael or kirk douglas?
my migraines had just gotten so bad that actually, it was my mother, of all people, that suggested I got acupuncture.
I put two needles in her, and, bingo, she starts to sob.
and she let me stay until I'd stopped, and then I invited her out to dinner to thank her.
and you're still thanking each other, huh?
so, how did annie deal with the new situation? Did she freak?
no.
well, you know how she adores her aunt liz, so I just told her.
you outted me to annie?
Why? Is that something to be ashamed of?
no. It's just that I wanted to be able to tell her myself.
like when's 60.
ladies, this is the 21st century.
you can take off your corsets.
Oh, I'm sorry. No. It's just , olivia said I should get used to pdas.
public displays of.
of affection. I know.
sorry.
so, how did annie deal with it?
she's fine. I mean, she sees how happy I am, that I'm more complete , that there's no missing part of me.
you know how it is.
well, actually, no.
Yeah. What's up with that?
you're this beautiful, brilliant doctor, and no one has grabbed you up yet?
hard to believe, huh?
honey, look in the mirror, ok?
you're one hot mama.
you've got sexy spilling out of every pore, doesn't she?
you do.
you know, I'm surprised you two never went for it.
Oh, liz is like family.
it'd be like going out with your sister.
well, call me stupid. You're married with kids.
I sort of assumed that you were straight.
lesbian lesson number one.
never assume.
time's up.
do you have an appointment? I'll give you a lift.
lesson two. hotel sex: Hottest kind.
we've got this incredible suite overlooking hollywood. I always stay there when I come out on business.
thank you.
thank you. -All right.
let's go take advantage of the kids not being around.
I can't wait to do you on the balcony.
and you hang in, ok? She's out there.
you just have to have a little faith.
thar she blows, laddy!
damn it, christian. She got sick.
Oh, come on. It's no big deal. There are plenty of women out there.
some are even potty trained.
well, I'm not like you, ok?
you see the slightest imperfection in a woman, and, poof, you're gone.
well, news flash.
the only kind of woman who doesn't fart and cry and look like crap in the morning is either inflatable or dead.
Sean, you're not gonna start dating the shitter.
stop saying that. -Come on.
how can you look at her naked body and not think,"rubber sheets"?
I got some leftover sloppy joe'S. Any takers?
no, thank you, liz.
asshole.
was it something I said?
I tell you, man, that guy is the job of the dating world.
first, julia moves to lesbaynia.
then bachelorette number two.
Julia is just a tourist.
she hasn't taken up residency, and I don't think she plans to.
I thought she had the hots for that olly chick.
gay, straight, who wouldn't be?
Olly is incredibly beautiful.
so she's just bi-curious?
right now, olivia is something dangerous and new, more satisfying than what she had with sean, but this isn't it for her.
you can see that every time olivia touches her.
poor sean.
I tell you, that julia keeps you guessing, don't she?
at least she doesn't shit in the hot tub.
they told me to come right in, so at's what I did.
and you are.
Weston, eden, like in "the garden of.
no. I meant, you are.
how old?
old enough.
I just turned 18.
is your mother or father going to be present?
I don't perform surgical procedures on anyone under 21 without parental approval.
well, my father is not really in the picture anymore, and I'd be too embarrassed to talk about it in front of my mother.
what is it you want me to do?
surgically, I mean.
my hymen broke while I was riding my stupid horse at school.
I could feel it rip deep inside.
I want you to reconstruct it.
well, why don't we call your mother and just talk to her about your problem?
I'm still a virgin, ok, and i want to decide who to give it to.
I don't want some damn horse deciding it for me.
I mean, blow jobs don't count.
that's just like kissing someone, you know, and anal is cool.
I mean, guys don't mind as long as they get to stick it in somewhere, but your virginity, that's a sacred hole.
it's a gift you give to someone you care about.
you know, I'm not comfortable having this conversation without a parent present.
is that why you're squirming around like that, because you're not comfortable, or are you hard?
you need to leave.
you know, I could make that erection go away for you.
I'd let you put it in my mouth, my ass.
2 out of 3 is not bad, right?
maybe another time.
it was nice meeting you.
you're even hotter than you are on tv.
who is it?
dykes on bikes.
we're having a "welcome to L. A. " Weenie roast with real weenies.
Christian, what are you doing here?
can't an old friend come by and see how an old friend is doing?
look at you.
I love this place.
I wish you'd called because I'm meeting olivia, and I have to get ready.
Oh, just slam on a pair of jeans and some birkenstocks, and you're good to go, right?
what's this that you're reading,"lesbians at mid-life"?
wow, you need a how-to book.
I thought this kind of stuff just came naturally. This is very interesting.
um, collected writing, literary work.
Ah, you mean like "the vagina monologues"?
Christian, do you have a problem with my sexuality?
I've always had a problem with your sexuality, and you've always had a problem with mine.
that may have been true once, but not any more.
why, because you're a lesbian?
no.
because I'm in love with olivia.
bullshit. For the first, time we have the opportunity to tell each other how we feel, and you pull this lesbian crap.
unbelievable.
you think I'm with a woman because of you?
I think you're with a woman because deep down, you realized that you can't fall in love with another man.
your ego is so huge, it's a wonder your head doesn't explode.
it's the only thing bigger than my cock, if you recall.
or do men disgust you now?
you know what?
I am gay, christian.
I feel like I'm being authentic for the first time in my life.
so, what we had wasn't authentic?
what we had was exciting and illicit and full of fantasy.
Oh, this has nothing to do with you.
it's just that women have a greater level of sensitivity.
sensitivity, my ass.
remember how this felt, huh?
you know what that feels like?
puzzle pieces fit, baby. Admit it.
let me make love to you.
what's the worst that can happen, huh, that I'm right, that we stop running?
damn it, christian!
Oh, you want honesty?
you can't stand the fact that i am happy without you, that I'm in love with someone else.
you keep lying to yourself, sweetie pie.
one day, the novelty will wear off, and you'll realize you missed your one chance at true happiness.
Olivia is a nice piece of ass, but she can never get inside you the way that I can.
so, this is nice, huh?
kind of like being back in florida.
how's school going?
mom says it's a little bit of an adjustment just because everything is new, which is totally understandable.
I want to come live with you.
Oh, sweetie, it takes time.
you don't know any of the kids yet, and you don't.
it's not the school. It's mom.
her being gay?
it's pretty new for her, too, you know?
I just want to live here with you.
can I, daddy?
how about I talk it over with your mom, and then we'll see, ok?
sometimes when things are different, you just have to get used to them.
then they're not so bad, you know?
Hey, annie.
that's cute suit, but lay off the carbs, pudge.
Annie's fanny is starting to look like a blubber butt.
how do you know that girl?
Eden? She's olivia's daughter.
want some?
my mom likes to loosen her girls up before she nails them.
Julia is quite the screamer, by the way.
why didn't you tell me you were olivia's daughter?
you mean use my real name?
would've spoiled all the fun.
you know, if julia is my new mommy, that practically makes you my daddy.
don't you want to be my daddy?
what I want is for you to stay away from my daughter.
you mean my little sister?
she's so sweet and impressionable.
Oh, I have so much to teach her.
you're a real little bitch, aren't you?
what did you just call my daughter?
your lovely daughter showed up at my office requesting a hymen reconstruction.
I don't care if she asks for a third tit.
you're never to use that word in reference to her again.
what's going on?
Oh, hi, julia. I didn't know you were here.
it was so quiet. What's the matter, mom, have an off day?
sweetheart, don't think that by going on the offensive, we'll forget that you're the one in trouble.
so, who popped your cherry?
Charles. He's black.
and that should make a difference?
well, he was too big for me.
it hurt when I rode him.
you thought you couldn't come to your mother because I was in the way?
Oh, no, julia. You're not in the way.
you aren't even here. God.
don't talk to her that way. I won't allow it.
I bet you don't even know the first thing about who this charles is, where he comes from.
I told you, charles is a goddamn black stallion, you racist piece of shit.
even if that's true, I'm sure it wasn't her first horse.
your daughter came to me to have her hymen redone.
doesn't that make you a little bit uncomfortable?
Julia is always talking about how you're one of the top surgeons in the country, so i assume she went to you because you were the best.
maybe the discomfort is subjective, doctor.
can I talk to you for a minute outside?
what is wrong with you?
it's about annie.
I don't think this is a good arrangement with you and olivia.
for her or for you?
I mean, if you're worried about annie seeing her mother with another woman, don'T.
she seems perfectly fine.
that's not what she told me.
what did she say?
she says she wants to live with me, that she's not comfortable with everything that's going on.
I don't believe that.
she never mentioned anything.
she loves you. She doesn't want to hurt you.
she's not happy.
she's my baby, sean.
I don't want to lose her.
Ah, you're late. We started without you.
sorry. I got a little hung up at julia'S.
pass me the roto-osteotome, would you?
unless, of course, you want to do the honors.
there you go.
how'd everything go with julia?
Julia is fine. It's annie.
she's uncomfortable with the whole julia gay thing.
she wants to live out here with me.
I can talk to her, sean. At that age, it's all about fitting in.
maybe she's right.
maybe I'm the one who's having trouble with it. -Maybe.
maybe I don't want to see her with someone else, male or female.
maybe annie is picking up on something from me.
you know what I think you should do?
you should take kate on one of those romantic california weekends, you know, like shutters down in santa monica or something like that.
forget about julia.
you're suggesting I take the shitter to shutters?
look. I was wrong. You were right.
we're all human. Everybody poops.
Julia doesn't need you to take care of her problems anymore, sean.
you're a free agent. You should just go for it.
Eden is rebelling.
remember how you always wanted to shock your parents?
well, most kids go through that stage, but when your mother is a lesbian, it's a tough act to follow.
she's giving it a hell of a try.
look.
gay or straight, as parents, we need to set limits.
I think she could use a few more.
her story about the horse was true.
I checked with her riding instructor.
after a particularly difficult hurdle, she had blood on her uniform.
look.
she's been through a lot.
being different, having me for a mom isn't easy on a kid, and if, for once in her life, she wants to be like the other girls in her class, I want her to have that.
I'm signing the consent form.
I'm not comfortable doing this.
Julia would never approve.
Oh, she already has. She says medically, you're the best, and as far as your ethics are concerned, she trusts you completely.
I'd have to see how extensive the tear is.
what if you can't repair it?
we'll have to use a dermal regenerative template.
I'd shape it to an exact fit, replicating the natural fenestrations that would allow normal secretions.
I want your hands on me any way I can.
I'm sorry you don't agree with my decision.
I'm just doing the best job i can, and I know you will, too.
what's the matter?
Matt, what.
I've left kimber, dad.
I've taken the baby.
I really need your help.
 She's beautiful, matt, but you can't just take her and disappear.
it's kidnapping.
no. Kimber knows she's with me.
she doesn't care. She can't handle being a mother right now, and she doesn't want anything to do with me.
I've been declared a suppressive person.
what the hell is that?
it's this whole campaign they wage against people who leave, you know?
I mean, they take your property. They take your kids.
there was no way I was gonna let them get their hooks into jenna.
all right. Just relax, all right? Here you go.
take a seat.
OK. Nothing is going to happen to you now. You're with us.
does your mother know?
no, and I don't want her to.
she's going through enough right now coming out to everybody.
I don't know. I was thinking maybe I could give it a try out here, you know, start over.
if I can make a few thousand bucks, find a place to live, maybe check into school, i think.
you've got 250 grand, matt.
I can't think of a better time to dip into it.
the money is gone.
she gave it to the church.
all of it? -Yeah.
Jesus, matt, that was our house.
I didn't know she was doing it.
that's my house, everything i worked for.
how could you have entrusted her with that kind of money?
he loved her, sean, all right?
he didn't know the bitch was gonna to rip him off.
look.
here's a few hundred bucks to tide you over.
I'll pay the first couple month's rent when you find a place.
Thanks, christian.
Yeah. Great. You be the good father and watch him take everything you ever did for him and flush it down the toilet.
dad, look.
I'm sorry, ok? I screwed up.
it's unforgivable, you know, and I wish there were do-overs in life like when you're a kid.
I have to change her.
come on. Cut the kid some slack.
he can't help it if he was born with his brains in his dick.
he's just like his daddy.
I'm having a great time.
I wish you were here.
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm just.
I'm just off.
off or off me?
beginning to question my technique.
no. Don'T.
you have a very good technique.
you have a great technique.
Oh, I don't know. I'm just distracted, you know, with sean and annie and.
that christian is a piece of work, isn't he?
mm, yeah. Yeah.
you know what I think we should do?
what?
I think we should get married.
we could drive to boston when we get home. The girls can be maids of honor.
Oh, god, olivia, I just don't think I'm up for this.
you know, I don't think annie is up for it. You know, I don't know that I am.
I am.
I love you.
orgasm or no orgasm.
sooner or later, I just
I just want the world to know it.
I just have to go to the bathroom.
I'm sorry.
it's not you.
OK.
it's me. I'm just distracted.
my daughter is going through a tough time.
OK.
ride me, baby.
ride me.
Yes!
full gallop.
harder, harder.
these sheets are real soft.
the blood supply seems healthy.
the risk of rejection is what we mostly worry about with the majority of allografts.
it feels very tender.
it will for a couple of days.
there's some slight swelling, nothing unusual.
it's real sensitive all along here.
whenever I touch it, it seems so.
I don't know.
once the sutures are removed, the extreme sensitivity should lessen.
not too much, I hope.
that'd be a drag.
do I have to worry about tearing my new hymen when I touch myself like this?
I'll recommend another practice for your follow-ups.
I don't want to see you in here again ever.
I couldn't leave L. A. Without seeing the pacific ocean.
I was driving around, and I just kept thinking, "what if he's right?
what if I'm running away from the only thing that I have ever wanted?
listen.
it's beautiful, isn't it?
it's the world's oldest song.
may I have this dance?
I should be the one to tell sean , unless, of course, you want to.
no.
then I'll tell him.
he'll be upset at first, but he'll come around.
he loves us both.
I'm sure he wants us to be happy.
he'll find someone, you know?
did he tell you what happened with that tv actress that he's been seeing?
Oh, my god, that guy sure can pick them, present company excluded, of course.
he's going to have to learn how to live without you, you know?
I've been doing it for years. Now it's his turn.
is that what gave you an orgasm, imagining the look on sean's face when you told him we were together?
that's ridiculous.
I love you.
how can you love what you can't even see?
where you going?
>Meho.
Olivia said that the only way I'd get you out of my system was to sleep with you.
I guess she was right.
Hey.
do you know when christian is gonna get back?
I wanted to ask him if he could.
you know what? Never mind.
it's not important. I'm sorry.
you need some money?
what did christian give you, a couple of hundred?
here.
no. No. It's ok, dad.
you made your stance on that real clear. I got it.
I was wrong.
I overreacted.
let me help you out. I'll make it out to cash.
um, why the sudden change?
we all make mistakes, right?
we all just keep trying to do better, be better people, overcome our weaknesses.
it took guts to do what you did. take it.
leave kimber, start fresh.
I'm proud of you.
Oh, did you get it?
I got $300 worth, courtesy of my two dads.
Yes. Yeah.
daddy mac gave me a big fat check to help me get me back on my feet.
next week, it's mommy's turn to save me.
Hey, I think she's hungry.
she's fine, matt. Will you help me with this, please?
patron silver, please.
thank you.
well, helen didn't exaggerate.
she said you would be over 6 feet tall and gorgeous, although she said you'd be sitting at the other end of the bar.
do I pay for the drinks now, or should I put it on my hotel bill?
and you are. -Valerie farell.
I probably shouldn't have used my real name.
Oh, well. Too late.
I'm sorry. Forgive me.
I'm afraid I've never done this before.
paid for someone.
tell me, hmm, does your husband know how you spend his hard-earned money?
only if there's life after death.
sorry.
don't be.
he's much better off to me that way.
my husband owned most of the city of santa clarita, california.
he was a very powerful man in every way but one.
well, as they say, money can't buy you everything.
as long as it can buy you.
Campbell, isn't it?
I think that's what helen said.
is it enough?
depends on what you're thinking.
3 or 4 years ago, we had one of the worst droughts in california history.
the fruit just withered on the vine, and then it rained, and it all came back.
it's been a long dry season.
well, I hope you brought an umbrella because they're predicting thunder storms.
I know matt is an adult and I'm not supposed to worry, but when was the last time you heard from him?
Oh, you know how it is with a new baby.
Yeah. I guess with kimber and the church, he's got his hands full.
so, what did you decide about annie?
you said you figured something out.
actually, it was her idea.
he was so checking you out.
here. Let me have those.
so, did mommy tell you? Isn't it great?
Annie wants to go to preston, the school where eden goes.
it's right outside of santa barbara.
isn't it wonderful?
I'll be able to look out for her 277 like a real big sister, and it's only an hour away, so daddy can come visit whenever he wants to.
married?
what kind of a joke is this?
this isn't a joke, Christian,. Matt and I exchanged our vows 3 days ago.
that's right.
we're pregnant.
you going somewhere?
you are going nowhere, which is why I am leaving.
what aboutJenna?
Jenna will be at ram's with the nanny, and that's where she will be staying when I am not with her.
Mr. Mcnamara? I'm colleen rose.
you have a very naturalistic process.
Seanie, I need you tomorrow morning, 6 A. M. Reshoot.
excuse me.
no, excuse me. I'm Freddy prune, executive producer and creative at hearts and scalpels, how can I help you?
and I'm Sean's agent.
next week you have a nude scene.
but it's undignified-- - I told that Freddy, forget it!
you get to keep that scrumptious weenie of yours under wraps.
Hey, cookie.
got us some Jamba juice. I've got banana berry or razmatazrazzmatazz which one do you want?
eden, right? Are you looking for Sean?
I think he's hanging out with the extras, somewhere...
no, actually, I took the studio tour and snuck away.
I've always wondered if the big stars have beds in their trailer.
I am big, darling.
Oh, do we have enough time?
Oh, they'll wait.
I run this show. In fact, I run the whole goddamn network.
is this some sort of joke?
I just don't understand why I'm here.
you are here because you are the new star of hearts and scalpels, that's why you're here!
what? - You put that little bitch up to it to set me up!
I'm in the middle of a surgery here.
Hi, Sean. We're caa, and we want to be in the Sean McNamara business.
you will not take away my star!
not take away my Sean.
what are you doing here, colleen?
I'm calling 9-1-1.
I think it's a good idea.
I'd rather stick with the cold phone call.
I want to look younger, like I did when we met.
that's kind of what New York's about, too.
new york?
I accepted a position at Nyu's teaching hospital.
we're moving back in 3 weeks.
Sean, she's in v-tac.
her rate's 150.
call 9-1-1.
we lost her. Olivia's dead.
new york's gonna be so strange without her now.
you're still going?
yeah?
can you stay awhile?
just until I fall asleep?
I'm not your significant other.
well, you are kind of. I mean...not really, but sort of.
Christian,, I don't like men. I like you.
I feel exactly the same way.
most of the time you drive me batshit, but you're the only woman I really trust.
can I talk to you about something?
Liz won't be coming over tonight. She resigned.
she's moving back to Miami.
tell us what you don't like about yourself, Mr. Skerritt.
the size of my penis.
a penis enlargement, great.
not an enlargement, a reduction. I've got a tyrannosaurus prick.
I'm a yoga instructor, and a few months ago I was at a retreat up in big sur.
it was 6 weeks, intensive, my body really started to open up.
and one day I was in plow, and I just started sinking deeper and deeper
so was your penis prohibiting you from achieving certain poses?
no. I can't stop sucking on it.
you mean metaphorically?
no, I mean, I spend almost all day in my apartment with my dick in my mouth.
Oh.
giant penis plus incredible flexibility equals the best blow job you have ever had.
self fellatio, that's impossible.
Mr. Skerritt, that's not
no, no, no, wait, wait, wait.
you can--you can do that?
I can't hold down a job.
and forget about a relationship, because nobody gets me off the way I can.
you guys have to help me.
I spend almost every waking hour with myself.
I know, it sounds like a joke.
but, it's a goddamn curse.
don't you think you should maybe see a therapist?
you know, to deal with your compulsive behavior?
I've tried shrinks. I even tried the drugs they prescribe.
but nothing is as strong as the impulse.
look, you guys staple fatty's stomachs so they won't eat. What's the difference?
well, the difference is there's no known surgery for a penis reduction.
you can understand how that procedure might not be in high demand.
so, how many inches do you want to lose?
I don't know.
just enough so I'd have to break my back to get a taste.
2 inches?
well, we're gonna have to research some options and get back to you.
just do it quick. I'm desperate, man.
will you stop with the judgmental looks?
don't tell me you guys have never tried it.
that close.
what?
let me be clear, kimmy.
I will never, ever do another surgery on you again.
well, that's great, because I look and feel fantastic these days.
I'm not the one who needs the touch-up.
she does.
hello.
Oh, I see. So you've gone from stupid to completely insane.
make fun of me all you want, grandpa, but thanks to my tireless devotion, your granddaughter has just been signed to the hottest baby modeling agency in town.
but in order to book the high-end campaigns, we're gonna have to do something about her mouth.
her mouth?
the Steves, her agents
steve Meyer and Steve freedman said she was perfection, right?
other than her thin, villainous lips.
which she did not get from my side, by the way, so it had to have come from that witch.
Hey, Linda, do you mind stop practicing your putting and get your butt in here, please?
are you gonna give her the injections right now?
well, that's fantastic.
love of my life. Would you do me a favor and take littleJenna, and give her a fruit bowl? Come here, you sweet little thing.
Oh, my goodness. Aren't you so sweet? Why don't you go with her while I have a little chat with Joan Crawford.
I knew you would have issues with this!
there is not a plastic surgeon alive who would operate on a baby, including me.
there are a number of plastic surgeons right here in Beverly hills who do work on babies.
Really?
name one.
I don't know their names, but I know that the Steves refer all their clients to them.
they do restylane, botox, lipo.
kimber, get out.
answer me this, Christian,, who's gonna pay for her college education?
your son, that zero?
you touch one flaxen hair on the head of that baby, and I swear to you, I will get custody ofJenna.
you and I have gone to such tragic lengths to feel loved because we weren't valued as children.
now, I am determined to give ourJenna a shot at feeling special, and to develop her sense of self and her value.
and I will move heaven and earth to give that to her, because nobody did that for me.
so are you--are you on board with that?
Botox on a baby?
it's criminal. You need to go talk to those modeling agents.
Kimber would never touchJenna now, trust me.
I'll put the fear of god in her.
well, it's not just forJenna.
you have a moral obligation to find out the names of the quacks they're using before they hurt any more kids.
fine! You figure out how to turtle Mr. Skerritt's dong, and I'll get right on it.
well, the principal would just be the inverse of the funditory and suspense religament release we do for a penis enlargement.
makes sense. Tighten the ligaments, shrink the Wang.
Yeah.
you know, if Liz were here, she'd be giving us a lecture right now about how Mr. Skerritt's compulsive self-fellating is just another example of our narcissistic society.
tell me about it. Isn't it nice not to hear her vagina monologues anymore?
I tell you, screw Liz. She walked out on us.
no, she walked out on you.
how can someone as self-involved as you not see that this is your entire fault?
I accept responsibility, which is why I'm taking care of finding a replacement.
I talked to a headhunter yesterday, and he's already sent over a stack of resumes.
and what qualifications did you give him?
must have big tits and a willingness to give blow jobs?
no. You put the resumes on my desk, ok?
I'm not getting stuck with some mediocre doctor just because she happens to be a nice piece of ass.
um, well...
let's, uh...
uh, if I may ask, theodora...
call my teddy.
Teddy...who is Harley?
that's my hog.
it's a motorcycle.
I race in the desert.
Oh. That would explain the motto on your other arm.
I got that after a wild night at Coachella.
and how do your patients react to these uplifting tattoos?
I've only ever gotten complaints from other physicians.
uptight old farts.
Yeah.
well, dr. Rowe--ahem-- you certainly like to live dangerously.
I like to live, period.
look, I am very good at what I do.
to get this job, do I need permission from you to be who I am?
if so, let me know now. I'm out the door.
uh, you were first in your class at Ucla?
I cheated.
kidding.
I just happen to pick things up pretty fast.
you're lucky.
maybe. Maybe I just get bored quickly.
I see. So...what guarantee do I have that you'll stay if we hire you?
there are no guarantees in life, doctor.
but I do promise if I take the job,
I will only take it if I find the place interesting.
and, uh, how-- how do we seem so far?
so far, so good.
what about you?
uh, your vitae is certainly outstanding, so
blah, blah, blah. Anything else you find interesting?
why do I suddenly feel like you're interviewing me?
I am.
Oh, my. She said granddaddy had good genes, but we're talking extra special genes.
I don't know if Kimber's filled you in, but she's getting in on the ground floor of a billion dollar industry
make-up, accessories, and of course, fashion.
armani, Gucci. Everybody wants in, everybody's paying.
we thinkJenna can be the next baby Cindy Crawford.
so what's all this talk about changing her?
Dr. Troy, in theatrical parlance,Jenna has thin, villainous lips.
people don't like that look on babies.
they like full, bee-stung, sensual lips.
that is really sick.
try to think of it in another way.
you were circumcised, I presume?
would you call yourself scarred or traumatized by that procedure?
probably what scarred you was more about being misunderstood or unloved by your friends and family.
that's a good answer, Steve, that's very good.
so who you go to, baby plastic surgeons? I'm curious if I know any of them.
we don't disclose that information.
I'm--I'm sorry.
I thought we came here today because you're interested inJenna's future.
right, yep.
it's the baby Dior people.
they want to book little amber for the fall collection.
Hello, Mary, we're thrilled.
what's the offer?
we're looking for 5 digits, Mary. 10, 000 a day.
10, 000! I had to do anal for that kind of money.
a limo with a fully stocked bar for mom and all wardrobe becomes property of baby amber.
love you, Mary. Stevie sends kisses.
So...where were we?
what type of augmentation did baby amber receive?
she was a Scowler.
there's cute crying, you know, with the tender little tears, and then there's angry, Scowly crying.
people don't like that.
so she was given a little Benadryl loll to keep her calm, and 4 units of botox.
she was a beautiful girl before the botox.
she's a beautiful girl now.
the only difference is, now her college fund is full.
Hey, Steves, could you tell Christian, how horrible and demeaning catalog work is?
you know, the kind that you said thatJenna would only book if she didn't do the lip filler.
it only pays about 275 a day.
and be prepared to wait in hallways with a sea of snotty tots and poorly-groomed moms.
I'm onto you guys.
why actually go out and hustle when you can beat the competition with chemicals?
come on, Kimmy.
we're out of here.
we are not sharingJenna's fortune with these lazy scumbags.
I'll be her manager.
good luck with that.
Oh, Sean bear!
Oh!
Oh...
Oh, man.
I could use a cigarette right now.
or a Jamba juice.
you're insatiable, colleen.
you're what fills me up, Seanie bear.
you, and your scrumptious, super-sized weenie.
Oh.
let's do it one more time before we eat, ok?
I'm gonna make you hit an e flat.
then you can run out to hooters, you can pick me up some hot wings. What do you say?
Oh, hooters. Oh, my god.
yeah?
Aidan, this is insane.
I know. I wrote the shit out of that script.
no, no, no. It's completely inaccurate.
I never slept with colleen.
Oh, that's artistic license, dude.
it's called increasing the stakes, raising the drama.
what we're doing is we're taking the viewer on a journey, Sean.
keep reading, you're gonna like it.
no, Julia. I said no, goddamnit!
Yes, I screwed a hot teen, but I'm not losing my children over it.
the only way you'll get custody over my children is over my dead body, woman!
damnit!
Oh, why, why?!
Hey, Christian,, I didn't see you there, buddy.
how was your day, partner?
rough one, huh? Yeah, me too.
Oh, I got a face transplant at 7 A. M. I better hit the sack.
don't stay up too late.
you killed Christian,?
I didn't know what to do with his character anymore.
what did you do?!
Oh, my
I gave you everything, cookie.
Oh--ah!
how could you leave me for the cia?!
the cia? I left colleen for caa!
I know. How cool is it that I made you a spy?
what's the big diff, anyway?
CIA, caa. Come on, they're both big and scary and they think they rule the world.
no. I'm not selling you the rights to my story, no way.
look, sean. You owe me, dude.
ever since I got out of sex rehab because of your little set up with Eden
Hey, look, I didn't set you up-- - Don't even go there, Sean.
don't even go there.
next thing you know, I can't get a job.
Freddy replaces me with Ricky Schroeder.
I am depressed.
and I say, you know what, screw him, I'm Costner, man.
I'm a triple threat. I write this script on spec, lifetime.
the network picks it up.
the Fairchild attaches herself to play colleen. Come on, Sean!
this is my comeback!
deadly tightrope: The Sean McNamara story.
it's my dances with wolves, man.
no.
I'm giving myself to you, Sean.
I'm sacrificing myself for you. I'm unarmed.
what are we going to do?
we're gonna kill some Indians?
Aidan? No.
we're not going to kill them, no. We're going to help them.
you're going to read it.
just read it, Sean.
just read the whole thing. The ending's amazing.
then we'll talk. I'll call you in the A. M. Or you call me.
I'll let you sleep on it.
I love you.
see ya.
maybe she needs some food.
we've been here over an hour.
no, I've fed her twice already.
I'm just trying to keep her from napping. She's hot.
honey, do you wanna play patty cake? No?
I'll be right back.
excuse me, miss? Miss, excuse me.
why did that lady just go straight in there?
we've been here since noon.
she had an appointment.
an appointment! We had an appointment an hour ago.
you're not with the Steves, are you?
they always get in first.
Oh, that is bullshit!
come on, Kimber, we're going in. Let's go.
get the kid, we're going in.
I'm sorry, sir, we still have one more mom we're waiting for
listen, lady. They're not going to get the job. We are.
Wow. This is so Hollywood.
see, honey, look. That's called a fake beach.
Hi. I'm Christian, troy.
I'm the little starlet's manager and this is Kimber henry, her mother.
next. Thank you very much.
excuse me? - Not what we're looking for.
have reception show the next one in.
is it because she's too fat?
because she doesn't need to eat the day of the shoot.
you can't just dismiss us like that.
she's the most beautiful girl you've seen all day.
fraid not. Thanks for comin'.
this thing's for those sunglasses, right? Over here.
let's take a look, all right?
Hey, come on, sweetie. Show this lady.
Hey, look, the kid is a star.
you want the honest truth?
cover her ears, sweetie.
you'll never get her a national campaign.
not with those thin, villainous lips.
that's my job.
since when is the anesthesiologist not allowed to see the patient's body?
I would just prefer it if we followed protocol.
Oh, my god in heaven!
Linda, get over here.
Linda, you stay right where you are. Teddy, that's enough.
why would a guy write "nam" on his dick?
he looks way too young to have ever served over there.
well...it doesn't say "nam," ok?
Namaste.
namaste home at night and play with that thing, oh, yeah.
all right, that's enough.
I've gotta get a picture of this first.
no. Absolutely not.
that's unethical.
then I won't ask you to take it. You do it, Linda.
it's not funny, teddy.
Oh, Sean, relax. No one will find out. Ok.
Ah, give me that.
now I know why Linda said the other guy's the fun one.
fine.
I'll get in there.
you know, I'm not a tight ass, you know?
I can kick back.
stretch it out.
I'll do it.
OK, that's great. Fantastic.
come on, smile. Get down, oh, yeah.
Oh, guys, that's fantastic.
I love that one.
Oh, my god. One more. Come on, just
holy shit! Whoa! Take one of me with that monster!
Aidan, what the hell are you doing here?!
I'm shadowing you, bro.
for the movie.
OK, great. Perfect.
Oh, wait, get one of me with my lips on it.
wait, maybe that would make me gay.
we just took a picture for our medical records, ok?
Oh, all right. But what is he? Is he like a circus freak?
I've never seen anything like it.
a yogi, addicted to sucking himself off.
God, if I could do that, I swear, I would never watch TV.
Hey, let's see how long it can get. - That's enough.
Don't--don't--you're suffocating him.
Oh, hey, did you read the script yet? The last scene?
I told you, I'm not interested in having a movie made about my life.
and that script is full of lies.
well, so what? Come on, at the end of it, you come out looking amazing, Sean.
the last scene, Sean, when you read it, you're the hero.
you off colleen, you save your daughter.
I mean, what else could you want?
and don't forget the nuclear bomb under the operating table.
that's--you don't like it?
easy lift. - That's it.
well, it's an easy lift. - No, this negotiation is over.
that's it. Out, out.
what?
you know what, I don't like your fancy costumes, anyway.
and your--and your medical jargon, your fancy talks.
doesn't even fit me!
none of this fits me!
I'm gonna scrub up.
prep him.
collagen's a natural substance.
I mean, babies get their ears pierced, right?
I mean, do you consider that child abuse?
no. Come on, do it.
no. I'm not doing this.
you are a stupid wimp just like your pathetic son.
to babyJenna.
to baby burberry.
to my new best friends.
right?
Cheers.
whoa, dude.
watch it, you're gonna strain your milk, buddy.
Oh, it's ok. Stretching helps the circulation. I'll heal up faster.
are you here to check my stitches?
I know it's hard to believe, but I'm not really a doctor.
Oh, ok. I'm sorry. Who are you?
get your head out of the ashram, buddy. Watch some television. Seriously.
I can'T. I don't own one.
You--neither would I if i were swinging your club.
I guess doctor-patient confidentiality doesn't mean shit around here.
no, you know what, you're right. You're absolutely right.
you know, your doctor, sean mcnamara, narcissistic prick.
Yeah. He's a ruiner of lives.
I've observed this firsthand.
I've been following him in anticipation of a television event I'm about to film.
I was there when he snapped a photo of your super dick.
what?
Yeah, he did.
I am a phenomenal actor.
and even I couldn't hide my distaste at his despicable actions.
why would he do that?!
why would he? That's a great question.
I don't know, why would he? Is he jealous?
is he?
is he jealous of your god-given gift, your beautiful, beautiful gift?
I don't know.
it's possible. I can understand that.
Ok...does he still have the pictures?
I don't know. I don't know.
I don't know, but don't worry, I am on your side.
thank you.
I am on your side. We are going to figure this out.
we're gonna figure--you know what you should do?
no, what? - You know what you should do?
this is your chance to cash in.
Yeah, I know you guys take a vow of poverty or something, right?
all you own is a pair of sweaty shorts and an incense burner, am I right?
cash in!
Oh, my god. I should get a lawyer.
Yes, yes! You should get a lawyer.
you should get a lawyer, you should sue the pants off them.
now teach me how you did it, myagi.
...your hands on it, looks good.
and the arms.
put down that coffee cup.
you don't work here anymore.
excuse me?
you're fired.
you can't fire her.
I can do whatever I goddamn like when it comes to violating the rules of the american board.
one of which just happens to be taking pornographic photographs of a patient under anesthesia.
I just got an earful from suck me off in there, and he's threatening to get a lawyer.
so you did. You actually took a sears family picture of you two and that guy's dick.
that is just not funny.
Yes, it is. - No, it's not!
look, it was terrible what we did, ok?
we weren't thinking.
but it wasn't meant for publication.
we were just trying to relieve the stress of being snake-wranglers.
when did I become the responsible one?
do you realize how ugly this could get?
Oh, relax, there is no evidence.
I erased all the pictures.
this guy is a yoga teacher.
he lives off canned lentils. Throw him a bone.
he'll leave here thinking he won the lottery.
I don't want to relax, sweetheart. Ok?
and where am i gonna get this bone from? Petty cash?
we could sell a pair of your shoes.
Oh, yeah, that's real funny.
you hired her. You fix this.
that's terrible. - Sorry, it is.
it is, it's terrible. We should never have done that. - Sorry.
you eaten yet?
well, there's nothing to eat here.
so I was gonna grab some dinner. You want to come?
Nope. I ordered chinese for me.
Oh, come on.
look, I'm sorry about what happened.
it was stupid and immature, and how can I be talked into something that was just so much fun?
Hey, when's the last time I cut loose?
before julia left?
Oh.
maybe I'm just not supposed to give a shit about having fun.
maybe you reach a certain age, and fun just isn't what life's about.
certainly hasn't been what my life's about.
what the
hurts, doesn't it?
probably not as bad as when you stuck a needle into my daughter's mouth!
Jesus.
well, what the hell is wrong with you?
Oh, don't worry, it's sterile and there's nothing in it.
very different from the crap you shot intoJenna's lips so she could sign some modeling contract.
did you actually do that?
Oh, of course not!
stop lying, man! I just picked her up from a play date and she looks like she's got a damn innertube in her upper lip!
that was my daughter, Christian,, how could you do that?
it wasn't me, you asshole.
did you ever think about Kimber?
Where's your phone?
I swear to god
shut up!
what do you want, matt? I'm shopping.
it's Christian, on speakerphone with matt so he can hear.
who the hell did you get to shoot up my granddaughter?
both of you need to calm down.
there's nothing wrong with Jenna.
her lips are fun. I'm the one who gave her the shot.
you did what?!
well, I've been injected a thousand times.
I know where to aim and I know how hard to squeeze.
it's completely safe.
I simply borrowed the supplies from Christian, when he refused to do it, and now Jenna's a star.
kimber, alley cats who dump their litters in gutters make better mothers than you.
Oh, well, then why don't you sue me, matt?
Oh, wait, on second thought you better not, because I'll haul your ass into court for the months you're behind on Jenna's child support.
why don't you shut up and say thank you?
What--thank you for what?
your daughter is only 18 months old and she's already more of a success than you'll ever be. Be grateful.
I'm sorry I stabbed you.
don't pop any champagne corks just yet, aidan.
I'm not saying yes.
I just wanted to know what the numbers might be.
all right. I'll call you.
Aidan says they're willing to pay 300, 000 for the rights, and another 50 to consult on the production.
holy shit.
Yeah, but I don't know.
if you could have read this script, it is terrible.
so have them hire someone else to rewrite it.
or don't, who cares?
I care. I mean, I don't want my image misrepresented.
I've performed some of the most interesting surgeries of all time.
of all time?
Sean, you should go hang out with Mr. Skerritt, you two have so much in common.
you both like blowing yourselves.
I don't need to listen to this.
you don't understand the pressures I'm under.
trying to raise 3 kids, trying to save up, buy a place of my own.
and you're willing to turn down $350, 000?
you walk around here like you have a camera on you, Mr. Perfect.
the dirty secret is, no one cares.
take the cash, give half of it to manny skerritt and blow the rest on a trip to Vegas.
stop worrying about how other people are going to react to you, and do what you want to do.
really. It's that simple?
it's that simple.
tell us what you don't like about yourself.
uh, I'll tell you what I don't like about L. A. Bro
doing 95 down sunset's against the law.
what happened to your neck, Aidan?
Oh, heh, funny story.
I was, I was out bird dogging with my greatest bro, patty D...
Dempsey. And paparazzi stops us at a stoplight, and then, uh, we peeled out when the light changed. Got some distance on those jerks, and then, my maserati hits an ice pass.
and the next thing I know, we're slammed against a phone poll at beverly glen.
so weird.
you hit an ice patch on sunset boulevard?
Yeah. Yep.
anyway, broke my neck.
wait, does this mean that deadly tightrope: The Sean Mcnamara story is not happening?
do I have to give the money back?
Jesus, Sean, is it always about you? I broke my neck.
the producers pushed the start date.
it was actually a good thing for me, because I can rewrite the script and, you know, make it better, more honest, more real.
you know, get rid of all that boring bullshit with the what's her name - Julia? - Julia and the kid.
let's make it more about my character, you know?
really flesh it out. Workshop it.
so what are you doing here, Aiden?
well, I get these things out tomorrow, and I know that they're gonna leave a nasty scar right at my temples.
well, that's easy. I think we can fit you in friday morning.
Oh, great. That's perf
Yeah, I gotta get back to work.
which reminds me, oh, you know, when I'm under, you guys wouldn't mind adding a couple inches in my pants?
you want a penis enlargement?
well, unless you can lengthen my tongue.
you broke your neck trying to suck your dick, didn't you?
what?
where did you come up with that?
That's--what are you--that's just
I can't keep the charade up.
I wasn't bird doggin'.
there was no ice patch.
ever since manny skerritt taught me how to pleasure myself,
I've been a man possessed.
I have gotten so close so many times.
but I just couldn't--I just couldn't- -I just couldn't get to the
you know, I just couldn't
I just wanted to give it little baby kisses, that's all I wanted. I didn't ask much.
then what happened?
I fall of my goddamn bed and I break my c2 vertebrae.
I just want to taste some nectar, guys.
that's all I want.
can you make that happen?
so, we have some scars from his neck brace that we'll have to revise, as well as the penis enlargement.
and I always say, start with the hard stuff first.
15 blades.
a 15 blade?
are you sure you don't want a paperclip?
I mean, Linda, have you ever seen anything that small?
looks like 2 blueberries and a cocktail weenie.
he doesn't need surgery.
he needs a miracle.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm just gonna
don't need to cause anymore trouble.
actually, you know what, he's the one that caused all the trouble.
he almost cost you your license.
prick.
little prick.
do you have your phone on you?
what are you doing?
Oh, just a little insurance policy just in case my fee on the Sean McNamara story doesn't quite cover my expenses.
heh, here we go.
Yeah, now I can offer up a little blackmail of my own.
have dinner with me tonight.
sorry, not interested.
I was thinking of something a little more adventurous.
you're so beautiful.
you are perfect. Huh?
and I love you.
I do. I love you very much.
I want you to know that...
that everything I do for you, I do...
I just want you to know that there's somebody who would give their life for you.
you know?
Christian,, come on, get out of here, we have a shoot to do.
her lips are impeccable.
and just the right plump.
what the hell are you doing?
what needed to be done, Christian,.
it's lopsided, you sick, twisted bitch.
I've had filler a thousand times.
it just needs time to spread. Right?
give me the goddamn needle.
she looks deformed.
see, she's not even crying.
like they said, when you mix it with lidocaine, it just feels like a kiss.
now you are perfect, aren't you, sweetie?
by the time I turn around, you better be gone.
don't worry, grandpa.
your reputation's safe, I'll take the fall.
everyone thinks I'm a horrible mother anyways.
Mrs. Caldarello, we've had tremendous success in lip reconstruction using the patient's labial folds.
what about when my husband kisses me?
if he finds out, he'll never kiss me again.
what about the secret joy of knowing that it's the first time those lips will have ever been kissed?
do it. Put my pussy on my lips.
if I may ask, theodora.
call me teddy.
why do I suddenly feel like you're interviewing me?
I am.
anything else you find interesting?
the tumor has spread to the supraclavicular lymph nodes.
give me a ballpark.
6 months.
I want you to marry me.
how does it look? Any moths?
give me a minute. Just to try it on, okay?
everything all right, bizzy?
it's been in storage since the day your father and I got married.
no, it's fine. - But?
I just need a little privacy. Please.
Oh. Sure.
Bizzy. That's what you call her, huh?
since she was 2 years old, she was always getting into things.
rearranging her room, sorting out the silverware. Very industrious little girl.
I encouraged her. I told her, you put your mind to it, work hard, you're gonna get whatever you want in life.
because let's face it. She was not going to get anywhere on her looks.
could I get you a drink, mariela? Soda, water?
please. And call me "mama."
patron doble. Because we are celebrating, aren't we?
my daughter is getting married.
and to a man of all things.
Yeah, well, nobody's perfect.
pretty close.
so why are you marrying my daughter?
um...the sex.
the last time I visited, she was a flannel-shirt wearing lesbiana who was having trouble getting a date.
what is the real story here?
the real story is I should be toasting you for giving me such a beautiful woman.
to family.
so you're gay?
this is an arrangement between you types?
you get insurance now or something.
Christian. Can you come in here, please?
Yeah.
can you please--could you help zip this for me?
you're gonna have to let this out a little.
Oh, no, I can'T. This is an antique.
it's an "as is" kind of thing.
well, this is not gonna work.
so, uh, why don't we just buy you another dress and we can start it on tradition?
Oh-oh. No. You don't understand.
ever since I could remember, my mom has wanted me to wear this dress in my wedding.
and then I came out to her, and neither of us thought this would ever happen.
a traditional wedding? In a church?
in my mom's dress?
this means everything to me now.
are you sure that's what this is about?
Bizzy. You know very well it is bad luck for the groom to see you dressed like that before the wedding.
ma! The dress doesn't fit!
ay, mira.
it's those tatas of yours.
you've always been top-heavy.
ladies, I think we're going gown shopping.
no. If I can't touch the dress, then I'm gonna shrink my chest.
I wanted it before, now I have to.
book me for a breast reduction.
well, this is quite a surprise.
it certainly is.
tell us what you don't like about yourself now, mrs. Caldarello.
her tits, her ass, that turkey waddle under her chin, and maybe you could lighten the luggage under her eyes.
I guess the only thing you don't have to do are my lips.
Oh, not those beauties.
you did such a bang-up job on them, doctors.
that's why we flew all the way out here.
well...that's very flattering, mrs. Caldarello.
you never struck me as the makeover type.
we could barely talk you into repairing the damage from your oven, I believe it was?
it's nice work if I do say myself.
I mean, you could never tell that the skin came from your
breasts. No. Never.
ordinarily it would be fine for allegra here to let gravity take its course, but she's gotta go back in the market.
I've got prostate cancer.
the doctors aren't optimistic.
Oh, boy. I always figured by the time I kicked, she'd be set, financially speaking.
I'll be fine, manny.
I can get a job.
with what skills, honey?
with a little luck and a lot of surgery, she'll find another guy.
someone who can care for her in the manner to which she should have become accustomed.
Oh, those lips...
I'm gonna miss them like nobody's business.
Ooh. Damn. Where's the head?
all I do is piss these days 'cause of the big "C.
by the way, I saw you on that tv show you did.
I was quite upset about that character you based on me.
the one you called--I can't even say it.
Pussylips. - That's the one.
and the part about her father abusing her?
Mrs. Caldarello-- - How did you know?
I am so sorry about your husband.
I know how devoted you are to each other.
I can't imagine life without him.
Hey, sadie.
Sadie?
Sadie sadie, married lady.
just trying to keep things light since you look at me like I stole your job, when you look at me at all.
let's have a little girl talk, shall we?
the thing is, is that I wanna spend as much time with christian and wilber as I can.
but if I stay home 247, they are gonna make me crazy.
so, I think we should split the job.
that's genius.
I'm totally ok with that.
Oh, now we can be friends.
it's so much easier.
ha ha! Ok, I just have to ask.
OK. I know, I know.
now, I am...now, let's see.
I don't take antidepressants,
I have no history of diabetes, no allergies to any drugs, no hypertension.
I'm all ready for my surgery, mr. Demille.
that's helpful. Thank you.
um, but what I really want to know is how it works.
being one way and then suddenly switching horses mid-stream.
isn't that weird?
you just loose interest in girls? I'm just curious.
bi-curious?
ha. I didn't mean to be too personal.
it's just that I have trouble keeping my own wilder side in check.
having secrets is difficult, painful. Don't you think?
how's our girl?
her milk bottles are down a quart, but aside from that, she's doing fine.
I'd say they're only down a pint. Didn't she ask for a high "c?
she said she wanted to fit into her mother's goddamned ugly dress, ok?
a "d" will do.
didn't this all start because she had back pain?
I mean, now we're killing two big-titted birds with one stone.
where are you going? Come on, hang around.
this is history right here.
This...my last surgery.
no more lipo on chunky divorcees or rhinoplasties on self-hating jewesses. I am free, baby.
I'm taking lizzy and the kid to italy.
we're gonna eat like pigs. I mean, who cares if I get fat, right?
why do you look at me like that?
listen, I've had to accept this and you will, too, all right?
which is why, I'm gonna start interviewing replacements.
who says I wanna hire someone new?
you think you can keep this train running all on your own?
this O. R. Is in use 70 hours a week.
I own half of that, which means that when I'm dead, that money goes to lizzy and the kid.
I don't want them to miss out because you're so depressed you can't get real.
they'll be taken care of.
you know that. Even if I have to pay them out of my own pocket.
I just think it's a little morbid to start interviewing people when you're still seemingly healthy.
look, sean, I'm doing the best I can to keep it together about all of this.
it's not easy knowing that your whole life is gonna go on without you.
I just wanna know that the guy standing opposite you in the scrub room every day is there because I want him to be.
I can't replace you, christian.
everybody's replaceable, sean.
even me.
can you, uh, can you call me when she's coming out?
sure
you're gonna have to let him go, sean.
that man is dying and not in a metaphysical "we're all dying" kind of way.
he's going to be a ghost before halloween.
life is changing. You can either ride the wave or get smashed to smithereens on the rocks.
it's easy for you to say. He's my brother.
graduated with honors from U. C.L. A.
and trained at cedars, distinguished residency at the joseph still burn center in augusta, guest editor for njm.
credentials speak for you.
that's encouraging.
if I was looking to hire a nobel laureate for surgeon.
so my partner and I have been together for over 20 years.
we've done over 6, 000 surgeries, I was best man at his wedding, and we have a son together.
so as you can imagine, we're not looking for somebody to just come in and play doctor.
it needs to be the right personality fit as well.
somebody who's willing to emotionally invest in the practice as well as the partnership.
Oh, well, that's definitely not me.
I'm only in this business for the money and the girls.
you're not married?
don't believe in it. - Kids?
not yet. But under the right circumstances...
what about your dating life?
often, but only if they're a 9 or a 10.
ever had twins?
sisters, but not twins.
ass man or tits? - Why choose?
new york or vegas? - New york is vegas for anyone with taste.
well, you have taste. I'll give you that.
so do you, dr. Troy.
this room, for instance, impeccable design.
this chair, milo baughman.
distressed celadon velvet. That couch...
the color, vintage tweed.
the whole palette of this room is...inspired.
I should give you the number of my designer.
you could kiss her ass instead.
I'm sorry. I know I get a little carried away.
my mother was in the business.
I grew up around this stuff.
you have a patient. Female. She's coming for a brow lift.
what's your approach?
how old?
early 50'S.
I'd push for an endoscopic brow lift.
provided you use a laser.
you get nearly the same results.
patient tells her friends about it. Quick recovery, and that only means more repeat business.
I don't wanna do this.
would you rather I hire him first and then you find out you don't like him?
I won't like him no matter how good he is. He's not you.
no, but he's got the best credentials by far.
I would think he could be able to break you out of your...
shelf from time to time, which you're gonna need when I'm gone.
don't say that.
let's go back to the wedding, right?
I mean, I need time off for that first, remember?
who picked out this table?
this is top of the line.
Double-swivel casters, split leg plates. Beautiful lines, too.
Sean spent weeks looking for the right table.
he had to have the best one.
well, I'm impressed.
work with the best, you never go wrong.
guess I have some pretty big shoes to fill then.
all right. Well, I guess I'll let you guys get better acquainted.
so, I understand you already performed a labial transfer on the patient.
about 3 years ago.
fantastic job.
no wonder she flew all the way out here to have you do it again.
thank you, doctor.
I just hope one day you can say the same thing to me.
OK. Fire it up.
what do you think?
beautiful work, doctor.
OK. Let's do some lipo.
after work, do you want to get a drink?
I'd like to, but I'm scouting locations for christian's bachelor party.
mind if I tag along?
it's always best to get a second opinion.
sure.
so this is christian's favorite place, huh?
nice.
what were you thinking?
10 to 15 girls back in the "champagne room" for the night?
that'd be fun.
Yeah. Fun.
I say something wrong?
no, this whole thing is wrong.
christian used to pull me in here after a difficult surgery to blow off steam.
of course he got the dances for free.
this doesn't make any sense anymore.
it is a bachelor party.
it's not just a bachelor party.
I mean, he's not just getting married. He's leaving.
the 20 years working together.
I suddenly don't have a partner anymore.
you're a good friend, sean.
I know I can never replace christian.
but if you give me a chance, I know we could make a good team.
it's nothing personal.
well hey, now that you mention it, I really can't see celebrating in this dump anyway.
it's grotesque.
girls aren't so bad.
the girls are top shelf.
but if you look at the upholstery on that couch, it's all frayed, there's food stains on the carpet.
and i don't even wanna know what you can see if you shine a black light on the chairs in the vip room.
are you hungry? 'Cause i know a great place to grab a bite.
it's not too far from here, and it's really tastefully decorated.
sure.
you're such a lucky duckling, mija, to have a handsome prince with the power to turn you into a swan.
that hurts. - They're going to be a little tender, ok?
no fondling for a week.
don't worry. You'll learn to love it doggie style.
Christian, my mother is standing right next to you.
ay, that's music to my ears.
nothing between a man and a woman is ever wrong.
there we go. Perfect teardrops.
they're more like water balloons.
why didn't you do what we decided?
look, I took them down so you don't need back surgery as you get older, period.
as far as getting rid of the two most beautiful assets you have,
I made an executive decision. One that we could both benefit from.
you're not even married yet and you're lying to her.
that was a bad decision for you to make.
my daughter is in charge of her own body. - Mom.
you're in charge-- - Mom, Please stop.
please.
Christian, I am in charge of my own body.
then why don't you order your body to put this on instead of that moth-ridden relic?
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god. Oh, my god, this is gorgeous.
sorry, mom. Oh, my god, it's gorgeous.
it's not you.
but you want the world to know how rich and glamorous you are?
or do you want to take your sacred vows in the same blessed tradition passed on from mother to daughter for generations?
ma, where are you going?
I'm gonna phone your grandmother and tell her the news.
dios mio. Me va a matar.
she's gonna kill me. And when she does, enjoy your wedding.
maybe wilber's wife could-- - One more word and I'll change my will.
here's the key. Dr. Troy said to make yourself at home.
Thanks. - You're welcome.
I just wish you wouldn't hand over your office to him so soon.
I'm not gonna be using it now.
and he really loves my decor.
jeez
that was awkward, huh?
well what the hell were you doing?
were you masturbating?
probably looked that way.
like you were screwing an invisible woman on my couch.
it was no invisible woman.
you were screwing the couch?
gentlemen, I'm completely embarrassed.
so let me apologize and explain.
I struggle with objectum sexuality.
what's that, couch-banging in english?
O. S. Is not a widely known condition.
it's barely understood. But it is real.
those of us who identify ourselves with O. S.
are fully capable of forming a strong relationship with...
physical objects. It stems from a belief in animism.
wait a second.
so you believe that physical objects can be sentient beings?
like us, they have feelings.
they can communicate, even express love.
so all this crap about relationships in the interview, you were talking about screwing one of the floor models at pottery barn.
I do have normal relationships with women.
they're just not as satisfying.
there's a long history of gender assignments with cars, boats, buildings
the difference is I've never stuck my dick in a tailpipe.
I try to fight the urge.
I didn't want to believe that I could be capable of finding something like a piece of furniture so attractive.
but there's something irresistible to me about a really well-built piece.
my whole life I've been attracted to perfection in all of its forms.
as plastic surgeons you can relate, can't you?
get out.
get out!
next time I'll do a background check.
Yeah.
you're right on schedule.
what do you think?
you're very good, dr. Mcnamara, but I think it's going to take sometime to get used to these.
they'll lose some volume once the swelling goes down.
no. I like this size.
it's just that I'm a shy person.
I'm not used to being so out there.
there's my baby.
did I tell you, tito?
reincarnated as gina lollobrigida, and she's not even all healed up yet.
Hello, allegra.
what is he doing here, manny?
Oh, he insisted on being here for your recovery.
what a guy, right?
sorry, dr. Mcnamara, this is tito.
our butcher from coconut grove.
my best brisket.
I know how you love it.
you should have seen the look on the x-ray guy's face at the airport.
I'm sorry, mr. Caldarello, but we only allow family in recovery.
but tito is family.
at least he will be after I die and he marries allegra.
him?
you're not gonna find a better candidate.
that butcher shop is a cash cow.
he's a widower, and his little girl connie is pregnant with twins.
I know how much you want grandbabies.
you can't handpick your wife's second husband.
we never agreed to this, manny.
I'm just helping move the process along.
I know my wife better than she knows herself.
she's always telling me how she and tito carry on.
I like his ground chuck, manny.
not to be too forward, allegra.
I've been giving you an extra quarter pound of it for years now, hmm?
I'm very flattered, tito, but I would have preferred if manny had waited until my transformation was complete before inviting a suitor in to see me.
I'm dying, babe.
every minute counts.
if I'm gonna have some say in all of this,
I don't have any time to waste.
how do you like her new breasts, tito?
grade a prime, no?
Allegra needs her rest.
and take your meat with you, please.
wonderful seeing you, allegra.
I am at the ramada inn in burbank if you want to call.
to the beautiful bride.
Oh, thank you.
finally.
Salud.
Oh, my god.
wnba season tickets. Oh, tess.
I love you, doll.
thank you. I love you.
and tell christian those are jack nicholson's lakers seats, ok?
maybe that'll convince him to go.
men don't want to see tall women with muscles slamming each other. Que es eso?
I know, ma.
that's what you used to tell me when I used to play for st. Mary'S.
and did you have many dates in high school?
with men?
are there any normal men in high school?
this one's from me. It's heavy. Be careful.
wow, I can't even imagine what's in this one.
open it up. You can read the card later.
it's a set of all clad.
now you're gonna have to learn how to cook.
like a straight woman. No more take-out.
and it has a lifetime guarantee.
Wow. Thank you.
you're welcome, sweetie.
wow, that's great, huh?
Yeah.
a lifetime.
Oh, sweetie, I didn't mean anything.
none of us can cook, right?
it's not that.
you're all just such great friends.
christian has cancer.
and we won't have a lot of time together.
maybe 6 months to a year.
Oh, sweetie.
I just love him so much.
now it all makes sense.
a man, a doctor with his looks.
what? Marrying me?
that's not what I said.
OK. Ok, maybe we should all go.
no, no, no. Please, please.
no, don'T.
my whole life you made me feel like something was wrong with me.
I wasn't as pretty as christy sherman or as feminine as kelly peterson.
I laughed too loud, I was awkward, I was clumsy.
you called me your ugly duckling.
and I believed you.
that was a joke, and you know it.
did I? You could never see me for what I was.
it was always what I wasn'T.
it didn't matter that I was funny, that I was smart.
the truth be told, if you could replace me with christy or kelly, you would have done it, wouldn't you have?
you weren't exactly an easy child, lizzy.
how could I be? I was fighting for my life, and the only one on my side was me.
if people made fun of me, what did you do?
you told me to lose weight, straighten my hair.
is it any wonder that I spend my life surgically altering people who hate themselves because they do not measure up?
if it wasn't for the people in this room,
I would have no self-image at all.
these women love me.
and a few of them have even shared my bed.
Oh, yes, that's right, mommy.
Oh, I'm so sorry if that isn't what you consider normal.
but maybe that's because you're not capable of loving anyone.
not even your own daughter.
I don't want you at my wedding.
I don't even want you in this room anymore.
make sure you get under the cushions, too.
I think he consummated it there.
I'd like to pay for the cleaning, if I may.
what the hell are you doing in my office?
I realized I left behind my things, and I also wanted to return this to you.
you could have mailed them in.
I didn't want to put you out anymore than I already have.
you really wanted to help me?
you could have found me another replacement.
I'm getting married in two weeks.
Congratulations.
I feel really terrible the way things worked out.
just make sure you don't bang the receptionist's desk on the way out.
excuse me. You're not using any toxic chemicals on her, are you?
if I'd known you were gonna look like sofia loren,
I'd taken better care of myself.
I'm not talking to you.
look, I know what I did was wrong.
I'm sorry.
Tito was a stupid idea.
can you ever forgive me, doll?
I can never buy meat there again.
I'm not just a possession you can give away to the town butcher.
I'm worth more than that, manny.
I know that, baby.
you deserve the best.
Yes, she does.
I'm glad you finally see that.
and the best is what you're gonna get from now on.
look what I got for you.
you're beautiful.
these are for you.
so what do you think?
well, manny...
if it makes you happy.
she'll forget me within a month after I'm dead.
people aren't like furniture.
they're not that easy to replace.
remember what I taught you?
you think you can do it?
Yeah, are you sure?
are you sure?
OK. I'm gonna go over there and you come over to me and show me what you got, ok?
Ok.- Ok.
OK. Ready? Come on over.
I think we have an expert.
I think you're pretty good.
now you know, the ring bearer, that's a very important job.
OK.
you think you can handle it?
hell yeah.
hell yeah? All right!
so listen to me then, why don't you practice a little bit more?
OK.
OK. Kissy kiss.
thank you. Go.
your mom really should see him walking down the aisle.
Oh, please don't start with me, christian.
I'm having a hard enough time as it is.
I never thought I'd get married, but if I did,
I was pretty sure that my mom would still be there if she was alive.
she called you at least?
Yeah. But my decision is final. She's not invited.
you know, you're gonna need her when I'm gone.
maybe.
but I don't need her now. She's been replaced.
Oh, yeah?
Yes. You guys are my family.
well hey there, buddy.
you wanna get in the middle of this? You do?
all right.
Oh, little wilber sandwich, huh? - Here we go.
little hug. Come on, squeeze it in.
I love you so much.
I don't feel anything.
keep smoking and keep going.
Christian, if you'd have put the money you scored this weed with toward the bill, we'd made the payment.
Well...all we hear is...
Oh, my god, we're on the camera, guys. We'll all be in the dark.
what's this?
I want to go back to school and be a pediatrician once...
feels like I'm losing everyone.
baby, baby!
I was out of focus.
I'm setting it on the right.
I promise that you won't lose me. - Christian, what do you want out of your life?
I know that I can't replace them.
but that's the best I have to offer.
it's a lot.
and a kicking-ass practice with sean where we make women feel better about themselves.
I want you.
I want to make people's lives better.
I want to make a difference.
the money's gone.
she gave it to the church.
here's a few hundred bucks to tide you over.
you need some money?
let me help you out. I'll make it out to cash.
I got, uh, $300 worth, courtesy of my two dads.
do you want straight sex, or do you want needles?
you are not screwing him for money!
I want back in the business.
you know, just a few choice titles, nothing too raunchy.
you need to kick the meth, hon.
it's very, very bad for my company's image.
so is this it? You're moving out?
is that what you want?
I want to be with you, but first you need to realize that who you are is nothing to be ashamed of.
it takes a strong individual to be gay in this world, Julia.
you're the only one who's even pretended to be nice to me.
will you stay with me, just for a little while?
are you ready for this?
this is so wrong.
that was inevitable.
it was just a matter of time before I got that stick out of your ass.
do you have a hair dryer?
where are you going?
out. D. J. Seventh son is playing at the whiskey tonight.
well, wait. I'll come with you.
don't you want me to?
um, we're done here.
this was a "get it out of our system" screw.
don't feel bad.
after-sex clinginess happens all the time, especially with older guys.
are you saying there's no chemistry here?
I like having sex with older men.
it's a daddy thing.
you're hot for your age.
you're even hotter because you used to screw the chick who's screwing my mom, but I don't date guys with gray pubes.
you lying bitch.
whoa. Hey.
well, what do you expect us to say, Matt?
you've been lying to us for months, spending our money on drugs, and putting our granddaughter at risk!
why didn't you just tell us the truth? We could have helped you.
do you have any idea of what the permanent effects of methamphetamine have on your brain?
I wouldn't be surprised if your dopamine levels were cut in half.
it's not like you can spare any, Matt.
you're a depressive personality.
well, thanks to prometa, we don't have that problem anymore.
Yeah, what's that, Xenu's brother?
it's a specially blended combination of medication and nutritional supplements designed to help suppress our cravings.
and thanks to prometa, we've been clean for 3 weeks now.
you do realize there is no truly effective way to reverse meth addiction.
your chances of a relapse are over 80%.
we know that we're always gonna have the urge, Sean, but we're fighting this together.
and so, what, now you want some "get back on your feet" money?
well, look at me, Christian.
the drugs were hard on me. I have got sores all over my arms.
this shit aged me, like, 10 years.
what's that saying, don't give a hungry man a fish, but teach him how to catch one?
look. We want to be self-sufficient.
Kimber's gonna model, and I'm gonna manage her.
Oh, jesus.
have you looked in the mirror recently, Kimber?
your face looks like a fraternity couch.
Yeah, I know. That's why I need you to freshen me up.
I want my looks back. They're my commodity.
I am a product.
crack whore magazine's next centerfold.
look. I know how disappointed you guys are in me.
But...look. Just for now, can you at least see us for what we've overcome?
you want plastic surgery? Go to Tijuana.
you want money? I'm sure wendy's is hiring.
you want sympathy? Write a letter to Oprah.
the double daddy store is closed.
what about Jenna?
our granddaughter will want for nothing, except parental role models.
now, if you'll excuse us, we have some work to do.
make sure you take the back door out. It's the way we take out the trash.
Julia is gonna be pissed.
frankly, she's not my problem anymore.
we can't keep enabling him.
excuse me. Can we help you?
God, I hope so.
shrapnel?
edges are too clean.
I had the x-ray done at the free clinic in el segundo.
they don't ask questions down there.
well, we do here in beverly hills. What is this, mister
doctor. Joshua lee.
forgive my paranoia, but I'd hate to put you in danger.
what kind of doctor are you?
ph. D.
I'm an astrophysicist.
I taught at harvard when that still meant something.
look. You're gonna think I'm crazy.
but hear me out, please.
you got two minutes.
I only need one.
I was tracking radio waves from deep space.
for years, we heard nothing but static, and then, one night, a series of blips.
you know what defines intelligence?
the ability to create patterns.
and somebody or something was out there in the dark doing it.
I'm sorry, but wouldn't we have heard about the discovery of intelligent life on another planet?
you don't think I tried?
I called in the team, my superiors...
but the pattern didn't continue.
and there wasn't any trace of it on the recordings.
they had erased it. - "They"?
the ones that put this thing in me.
I knew too much. I was too close.
they had to keep tabs on me.
you have an alien implant.
they need to track me.
the lead blocks the signal.
why don't they just kill you?
think I wouldn't rather be dead?
this thing aches so much.
all right. Let me take a look.
I guess the aliens aren't, intelligent enough to prevent sepsis.
I picked at it with a hanger trying to get it out.
you know, I'm just a funny story to you two, but I researched you.
you take complicated cases.
please, help me.
dude! Dude! Sean.
Hey, come on up.
what's up, my brother from another mother?
taking a nap?
no, just a little afternoon delight!
Ooh! This is Leah.
Hey. - Hi.
dutch oven. Dutch oven!
that is so gross.
get out of here.
no, no, not you! Not you. You.
OK.
get out. Go on. Go.
how old is she? - 18, I think.
when you're a senior in high school, that makes you 18, right?
Ooh. Hey, don't get all east-coast judgy on me, Jean.
come on. There is no shame in dating a young girl.
I mean, this is hollywood, right?
I mean, that's why we come here.
I mean, they're tight as a chinchilla's ass, and they don't care if you listen to them because most of the time, they've got nothing to say.
But...how do you keep them interested?
you must be 10 years older than she is. - Try 20.
who did your work?
I've never been under the knife.
well, except for when I had my dick shortened.
I'm kidding. Ha ha ha! I'm kidding.
no, honestly, doc, I hate to break it to you, but i think plastic surgery's a little 20th century.
I mean, hormones, colonics, thermage--that's the new age.
a good I. V. Push can keep your hair from going gray way more than a grecian formula.
I got this, uh, indian doctor.
he is the L. A. Guru. I'm not kidding.
I don't know what he puts in his I. V.'S, but, dude, that shit is magic.
can I get his number?
Just...for research purposes.
Oh, screw that. I'm going Manana. Why don't you come with?
uh, I'm actually kind of busy tomorrow.
well, that's perfect. We'll come to you.
OK.
Hey.
what do you want, Kimber?
You...inside of me.
what makes you think I want to stick my dick inside that cesspool of a vagina of yours, risk having it being bitten off by one of those alaskan king crabs you got swimming around down there?
get out.
Christian, I need you to do my surgery.
telling the truth isn't gonna make me change my mind.
you want more of the truth?
I am going back into porn.
I guess if you're gonna be a degenerate slut, you might as well get paid for it.
but I'm not gonna do your surgery.
how many times do we have to go down this road, Kimber?
I'll break up with Matt.
I thought you two were in love.
I screwed up, ok?
but my life doesn't have to be over.
fine. But I get Jenna, too.
sign over custody to matt, and you get your pretty face back.
you ok?
you haven't said a word since we left the shop.
look. I've had plenty of girls with sexual problems.
and who's the common denominator in that equation?
all right, enough. Do you want this or not?
why do you keep asking?
you wanted the sex toy, we got the sex toy.
not the toy! Me.
all my friends told me not to date a straight girl.
Ohh. This again. Why do I have to decide whether I'm gay or whether I'm straight?
choosing your sexuality is a commitment to me.
I'm in love with you, and I need to know that I'm not alone here.
excuse me. Are you finished? - Just a minute, please.
step over here. This is loaded.
you're going to take out all the money you can here.
then we are going to get into your car.
what's your name?
can I please go?
please, can I go?
there's another one. Pull over.
what's the point? I--I can't take out any more.
bullshit.
no. This is the sixth atm that we've tried, and I have a limit on my card.
please, please, can--can you let us go?
you can have my jewelry.
what are you two?
girlfriends.
that's what I figured, the way you were going at it.
where are we going?
North.
is she always this way?
when she's scared, then i think she has a right to be.
but you are not scared. Are you the man?
up there. Pull in up there.
right over there.
come on.
go stand there in the light where I can see you.
in the light.
stop right there. Now take off your clothes, down to your bra and panties.
we--we have more money, and...I have $2, 000
strip!
will you calm her down?
hug her.
kiss her.
kiss her.
help me.
please. Please.
use it. Use it on her.
use it on yourself, asshole!
are you testing me?
I've killed people before.
then just do it already!
turn around.
turn around!
walk.
Oh, please. Please.
he's gone.
he's gone.
he's gone! Oh, my god!
he's gone.
this poor girl. Trouble just walks alongside her.
screw her. How many times have I fixed the outside of this succubus?
and what changes on the inside, huh? Nothing.
you know the definition of madness?
when you keep doing the same thing over and over and over expecting different results.
the only thing mad about her is that she still has feelings for you.
well, there comes a point when you just have to let go.
Kimber has a disease of the soul.
get too close, you catch it.
Dr. Troy? - Yes.
the police are on the phone.
it's julia.
they called from an emergency callbox up north off of 5.
if you ask me, they are lucky to be breathing. Right here.
are you ok?
I'm so sorry.
we're fine. We just need to go home and have a hot shower.
I don't even know why julia called you.
I'm sure the police would have given us a ride.
I just want to see the kids.
can I take them home?
I'd like to do a rape kit first.
what? He raped you?
no. Uh, we already told you that.
well, honestly, a lot of women say that on the night of an attack.
are you kidding me? These women have been terrorized.
now you want to violate them as well?
look. I'm just trying to do my job.
I mean, this guy could do this again, and I would hate to lose evidence because they went home and they took a shower.
no. No, Julia, I want to go home.
why don't you take your rape kit, put it next to your box of doughnuts, and go arrest some bad guys?
let's go.
Hey, Seannie, you name me one doctor
I don't care what country he's from--still makes house calls.
Yeah. Name one who charges $1, 200 an hour and doesn't take insurance.
I heard that.
Heh heh! Ooh, I can't laugh.
you feel that? That's the radioactive waves heating the skin and stimulating collagen growth.
I know how it works, Aidan. I'm a doctor, remember?
when we're done here, we're gonna look younger than the Olsen twins.
I need to be honest with you.
I'm not doing this for research.
I'm seeing a girl.
a young girl.
what is she, 17? Because i got a guy that can fix all that up.
Yeah, birth certificate-- - No, no, no, she's 18.
she's my ex-wife's girlfriend's daughter.
dude, the sexual permutations are frying my brain.
all I can think about are the 50 different ways it's wrong.
Hey, hey, hey. Guilt is the number one negative chi producer.
if you let that fester, it will age you, Seannie.
I need you to exhale and let it go.
I'm going to begin the I. V. Push treatments now.
I feel flushed. Is that niacin?
and magnesium phosphorous and 4 times the daily requirement of vitamin C.
all the skin vitamins.
is this really gonna take away my gray?
look at me. I got the hair of a 12-year-old boy.
I'm sad you're so hung up on this one girl.
dude, teenagers are supposed to be fun.
you know? It's like candy on a conveyor belt.
one passes you by, oh, look. There's 20 more coming of age right now.
no. I'm cutting off girls born after '79.
this was an exception and a mistake.
Really? So that's why you're doing all this?
you want to know why she dumped you?
because you showed her that you cared.
teenagers are insecure.
you let on that you like them, they're gonna think something's wrong with you.
not Eden.
OK. All right. All I'm gonna say is, the harder the chocolaty outside, the gooier the nougaty inside.
you know what I'm saying?
Hey, I'm having a big bash this weekend. Why don't you come by?
there'll be cocaine, young girls. Huh? What do you say?
Ah. You and Aidan done jerking each other off?
I think he looks great.
give me your guru's number.
did he wax your vaginas as well?
my skin is tight, my chi is aligned, and I feel 10 years younger.
you should try it, Christian.
you're looking a little rough around the edges.
don't you worry about it, but Julia and Olivia got carjacked last night.
what? Are they ok?
physically. I picked them up from the police station this morning.
I should call them.
don't worry. She'll be in here this afternoon.
she needs to talk to the both of us.
when did this happen? I mean, I didn't get any messages.
she called me because I'm good when things get hot.
and I'm not?
look. We're all just friends, right?
I wouldn't worry about it.
you have any idea what the hell this is?
it's a microchip, but there's no serial number.
I've seen one of those before on the websites about alien abduction.
that's exactly what an implant looks like.
whenever I wonder why you're single, you have ways of letting me know.
tease me all you want, but i saw a ufo in miami, Christian, and I was not the only one.
Oh, come on, liz. This is man made.
then how did this get in his back?
and why doesn't it have any markings on it?
you think creatures who are intelligent enough to travel through space aren't smart enough to create devices made out of carbon?
jeez.
send that out for tests.
where?
are you sure you want to do this?
I brought you guys here for support, not to talk me out of it.
I support you. - We both do.
buying a gun is a completely appropriate reaction for what happened to you.
thank you.
you're far more likely to be killed by your own gun than a criminal'S.
that's not what you said after your attack.
a republican is a democrat, who's been mugged.
that's a . 45.
my girl digs it because it fits in her hand.
pick it up.
Oh, yeah. That is heavy.
look at it like a cell phone on a long drive.
you never have to use it.
it's all about state of mind.
OK. I'm gonna say it. This is insane.
Julia, you were the victim of a random attack.
one in a million. This is an overreaction.
why are you so upset about this?
because my kids live with you.
so get a lock.
you know, I'm not sure she should be taking advice from a man whose idea of taking responsibility is pulling out.
would you two shut up?
I think that this will fit in my purse and, um...
I'll take it.
the chip works as sort of a lojack, except for people.
and I realize that sounds really cruel, but this is the third time my father's wandered away from the nursing home.
and the last time, he almost died from hypothermia.
we're just happy it started working again.
this is not my daughter. My daughter is fat.
Dr. Lee, this is your daughter Wendy.
she has the I. D. And your medical file to prove it.
and you have alzheimer's disease, which is making you very confused right now, but you don't have to worry about anything.
they'll tell you anything to discredit me.
I've come too close.
OK. Ok, daddy, it's time to go now, all right?
get your hand off me. I won't go with her.
look at me. I'm not crazy.
these men are from the care facility.
they're gonna take real good care of you.
it's 2007. George Bush is president.
the celtics are good again.
please! I don't want to go with them.
please! I don't want to go with them.
I don't want to go
Oh, the doctor's in the house, everybody.
this is the debate team.
all right, girls, you can take off.
why don't you go argue with somebody?
seriously, take off.
but I'm gonna be checking your notes to see who won, Cheryl.
I don't even know if that's her name.
Hey, so, what do you think of my theme? I got this whole hell thing going.
I call it dante's infernal.
I was actually thinking about going home.
you can't go home. Come on. You're my wing man.
you never abandon your wing man. Didn't you see "top gun"?
I appreciate the effort. This just isn't for me.
what? Good energy's not for you or some women?
Oh, shit. - What?
that's her.
Wow. She's like a little lion cub.
I, uh, I got to go.
Oh, no, no, no. Well, do you want her?
Yes.
OK. Chug.
OK.
that's it. Now we're-- excuse me, ladies.
just made a little jump.
Hey!
you know my boy Sean?
what are you doing here?
ha ha! Abby, panty time. Let's go.
Panty--right here. Who's next?
come, get a drink with me.
I'll catch up. What do you have left, Abby?
I'm killing.
that was nice work.
step off, Rexy.
Hey.
Hey.
want to go somewhere private?
impressive.
I got a little obsessed with personal safety after I got attacked.
thanks for doing this with me here today.
you know, I couldn't have done it alone.
and Sean was so judgmental about these things.
you've always come to me when you needed strength.
how's Olivia?
like it never happened.
I'd be in denial, too, if i fell apart like she did.
you know, that is not fair, Christian.
Oh, come on. You can't tell me you weren't shocked by the way she reacted.
fine. I was surprised, ok?
well, that's what you get for dating a woman.
no wonder you want a gun.
now it's your turn.
remember, you have to start a relationship with it.
without you, then it's just a paperweight, ok?
now put the magazine in.
excellent.
OK, now spread your legs and bend your knees.
so raise the gun. There you go.
and aim it. Then move your finger over the trigger.
good. You feel that?
Yeah.
feels good, don't it?
OK. Ok. Now squeeze.
Hey. What are you doing?
packing.
where did you get this?
I had to steal it.
certainly you couldn't afford it.
are we going somewhere?
you are going nowhere, which is why I am leaving.
I don't understand. I thought we were doing good here.
have you looked at this place?
I got a job.
Oh, really? Where? Burger king?
ha ha! Oh, my god. I knew it.
look, I made a deal with Christian.
he does my surgery, I dump you.
Oh, I thought he was doing that for us, you know, to help us.
that's what I told you, but I lied.
you know, he's just manipulating you again, Kimber.
no, he's not, because it was my idea.
and no matter how good he can make me look,
I can't move forward carrying your dead weight.
I love you.
Oh! Stop. Please, Matt. You're pathetic.
where did you get those earrings?
did you have to steal those, too?
ram gave them to me. We're relaunching the kimber doll.
you know, it was a celebratory gift.
did you sleep with him?
of course I did.
and it was the first time that I have come in months.
Oh. Oh, christ.
I.I am so sorry.
so, um.So what about Jenna?
Jenna will be at ram's with the nanny, and that's where she will be staying when I am not with her.
you can't take her away from me.
Oh, really? You want to fight me, johnny burger king?
ram adores her, ok? And he's got a lot of money.
I never loved you, Matt.
I told you I did, but I lied.
and I'm really sorry.
I hope some day we can be friends.
I can't come.
it's the "E." Here. Try this.
Ohh, too hard?
what's wrong, Sean?
call 911. I'm having a heart attack.
Jesus. Sean, are you ok?
I called you both. Is that all right?
of course it is!
some week you're having, huh, Jules?
honey, what happened?
the nurse said that you might have had a heart attack.
he didn't have a heart attack.
he had an adverse reaction to ecstasy.
Jesus christ, man. You know there's an age limit to that shit.
huh? It's like listening to fall out boy.
it's that cocknocker Aidan stone.
he's a bad influence on him.
Aidan didn't give it to me.
well, then who did?
Eden. We're having an affair, sort of.
sort of? Sean, she's a child.
she's 18.
and I didn't call you down here to judge me.
could you just be my friend right now? Is that all right?
no. I mean, even if I could get past the fact that you have had sex with yet another barely legal girl, what am I meant to do, smile and just stroke your bruised ego when you've slept with my girlfriend's daughter?
it had nothing to do with you.
bullshit, Sean! There are a hundred starlets you could have bedded.
you're right. I don't know what I was thinking.
Yes, I do. I'm 42 years old, and I can feel it.
my knees creak when I walk. I get up to pee twice a night.
you know who I am now when i smile at twenty-something girls?
I'm the creepy old guy.
my flame is dying, and I can feel the cold air coming in.
Eden reignited me. She was like a bucket of gasoline.
you don't have to tell me about the spiritual benefits of young pussy, Sean.
I've been dipping myself in those healing waters for years.
Yeah, you have!
I'm sorry if I scared you guys. I didn't mean...
I didn't mean to do any of this.
Oh, come on. Come on. We've all got regrets, made mistakes, right?
we're here for you.
Thanks.
OK?
we need to talk.
about what, your sexual identity crisis?
save it for the shrink, lesbot.
listen to me, you little bitch.
you stay the hell away from Sean.
you think this sophomoric act is charming? It's not.
you think that prancing around in your plaid skirt and seducing older men makes you special?
it doesn'T. It makes you a stupid whore.
I have deep feelings for Sean, Julia.
and I can provide him things that you no longer can, such as youth and a certain tightness.
listen, do not screw with him or any other member of my family.
and you especially don't screw with me, or I will talk your mother into sending you away to reform school far, far away from us.
do you hear me? Good.
is that decaf?
Yes, dad.
hello.
Dr. Mcnamara, dr. Troy?
I was wondering if you recently treated a dr. Joshua lee.
about 6-feet, 70.
deep voice?
that's him.
Oh, thank god.
when the insurance bill came, I got this jolt of hope, but I wouldn't let myself believe it until I was sure.
I'm sorry. I'm motor-mouthing.
it's just that my father has been missing for months.
he just disappeared.
no change of clothes, no note.
they had to suspend his nasa project.
I'm sorry. Did you say your father?
Yes. Can I see him?
your sister picked him up yesterday.
I don't have a sister.
her name is Wendy.
that doesn't make any sense. I'm wendy.
he did say she was fat.
I have a thyroid condition.
I don't understand.
why would someone claiming to be me come and take my father away?
he's a broke scientist who gets off looking at the stars.
who would do this? Who?
you asshole.
I guess Kimber lowered the boom.
take my advice--move on. I just gave you an early birthday present.
I love her. She's all I have.
it kind of sounds like your whole sorry-ass life, don't it?
huh? No money, no prospects, and the love of your life is an old skank who's about to take it up the ass again for cash.
you know, she took Jenna.
been living with some millionaire porn producer, and she won't even let me see her!
come here. Get in here. - What are you doing?
come on. I'm trying to make a man out of you.
huh? You've always been such a wheezy little bitch.
no wonder Kimber dumped you.
what? You don't love me anymore either?
of course I love you. I'm your father.
I don't want to see you until you get your shit together, you hear me?
you need to grow up, Matt, and do it fast.
until then, consider yourself an orphan.
is Sean home?
no. He's at his internist'S.
Why?
I need you.
make love to me.
take care of me.
Hi, JULIA.
I MADE SOME FRUITCAKE AS SORT OF A PEACE OFFERING.
WHAT'S--ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
I'm RACHEL BEN NATAN, YOUR BURN REHABILITATION COUNSELOR.
how DID IT HAPPEN?
I SAT DOWN ACROSS THE TABLE FROM A VERY HANDSOME BOY
when HE BLEW HIMSELF UP.
who KNOWS YOU'RE SCREWING EACH OTHER?
we LOVE EACH OTHER, SEAN.
I SEE SOME KIND OF CALCIFICATION.
well,
Rachel's NOT A COMPLAINER, DAD.
she's BEEN THROUGH ENOUGH SURGERIES
that IF SHE SAYS THE PAIN'S BAD...
OK. LET'S SEE.
how DOES THIS
we CALL THAT EXQUISITE TENDERNESS.
pain SO BAD IT'S BEEN CAUSING ME NIGHTMARES.
I've BEEN WAKING UP ALL EDGY AND HOPELESS.
the FACT THAT THE PAIN IS SHOOTING INDICATES TO ME THAT IT'S A NEUROMA,
which MEANS THAT THE CALCIFICATION HAS SEVERED THE NERVE,
and THE 2 ENDS ARE TRYING TO FUSE,
but THEY'VE TURNED IN ON THEMSELVES AND BECOME A BALL.
can YOU REPAIR IT ENOUGH TO STOP THE PAIN?
Absolutely.
we WOULD, UH, RESET THE NEUROMA,
harvest A SECTION OF NERVE FROM YOUR LEG,
which WE WOULD THEN USE TO BRIDGE THAT GAP BETWEEN THE 2 NERVE ENDINGS.
you NEED TO REMOVE A NERVE FROM MY LEG?
well, UM, DAD'S ONE OF THE TOP CRANIO-MAXILLO-FACIAL GUYS IN THE COUNTRY.
interesting.
so YOU DO WANT SURGERY.
you JUST PREFER DADDY NUMBER ONE OVER DADDY NUMBER 2.
it's COOL. I GET IT.
I'm NOT HERE FOR FACIAL RECONSTRUCTION, DR. TROY.
we're FINE HERE, CHRISTIAN.
I HAVE IT COVERED.
okey-dokey.
so HOW YOU DOIN', MATTIE?
Ah, GETTIN' BETTER EVERY DAY WITH RACHEL'S ENCOURAGEMENT.
well, THAT'S GOOD.
what's THIS?
I SAID WE'RE GOOD HERE.
OK.
looks LIKE A TOOTH TO ME, BIG GUY.
Jesus. HOW DID I MISS THAT?
based ON THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE SHAPE,
I'd SAY IT'S A CENTRAL INCISOR.
right.
must BE ONE OF YOURS DISLODGED FROM THE BLAST OR SOMETHING.
no.
I LOST 8 TEETH IN THE BOMBING, BUT NO INCISORS.
no WONDER I'M HAVING NIGHTMARES.
my BOMBER IS ALIVE AND WELL,
living INSIDE OF ME.
15 BLADE.
the B. P. IS 180 OVER 60 AND DROPPING.
Dr. CASEY, I NEED THAT TOE NOW. BONE CUTTER.
B. P. 190 OVER 50.
cut THE TOE, DOCTOR!
which ONE DO YOU WANT?
we ARE REBUILDING THIS WOMAN'S CLITORIS, DOCTOR.
there WAS A TERRIBLE CAR ACCIDENT.
the VAGINAL CANAL WAS SEVERED BY A GEARSHIFT.
I'd SAY THE BIG ONE.
I WANT THIS WOMAN COMING HARD.
cut! CUT!
cut! CUT! CUT!
damn IT, HE NEEDS MORE CLASS, YOU KNOW.
think CLOONEY.
I THINK YOU SHOULD GIVE THE LINES TO SEAN.
dawn, DARLING, I'M THE DIRECTOR.
I SAY, "CUT.
if YOU HAVE A PROBLEM, WAIT UNTIL AFTER THE TAKE,
and THEN WE CAN DISCUSS IT. YEAH. WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?
time IS MONEY, NIGEL, MY MONEY.
I AGREED TO PAY FOR ALL THE OVERAGES ON THIS SHOW,
which ARE CONSIDERABLE, IN EXCHANGE FOR A PRODUCER CREDIT.
if I WANT YOUR OPINION,
the TOPIC'LL BE BAD TEETH.
and, YOU,
you KNOW, THIS STORY ALREADY STRAINS CREDIBILITY.
can YOU TRY SOME FREAKIN' REALITY? I DON'T UNDERSTAND
how THEY LET THIS BEAST ON THE LOT, OK?
I MEAN, THEY DON'T LET ANIMALS IN HERE. DAWN?
director, WHY DON'T YOU DO SOMETHING? DAWN--EXCUSE ME.
dawn, THIS IS A MEDICALLY ACCURATE STORY.
uh, CHRISTIAN AND I OPERATED ON A WOMAN
who SUFFERED A FEMALE CASTRATION IN HER NATIVE VILLAGE.
you SEE THAT?
that IS THE WAY YOU PLAY A LEADING MAN.
he HAS THE COURAGE OF HIS CONVICTIONS, YET HE IS CLASSY.
he IS ALWAYS CLASSY.
??? everybody. Aidan: I BELIEVE EVERYTHING I SAY. I TRAINED
I HAVE SOME GOOD NEWS.
I HAVE SOME BAD NEWS HERE, FREDDIE.
glad YOU SHOWED UP, OK,
because YOUR TWIN OVER HERE
is TRYING TO MESS UP ALL OF MY MAGIC SAUCE. TIMEOUT.
I REALLY DO I WANNA SHARE MY VICTORY.
as OF TODAY,
we HAVE OFFICIALLY BECOME A CULTURAL PHENOMENON.
I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE WITH THE GRAND MARSHAL
of THE WEST HOLLYWOOD GAY PRIDE PARADE,
asking US IF WE WOULD LIKE TO RIDE ON OUR OWN FLOAT!
why WOULD YOU WANNA RIDE IN THAT PARADE, FREDDIE?
um,
butter BEAN,
it's NOT EASY TO GRASP.
when YOU GET EMBRACED BY THE GAYS,
you OFFICIALLY BECOME A CARD-CARRYING MEMBER OF THE ZEITGEIST CLUB.
hmm. NO MAN OF MINE IS RIDIN'IN A FRUIT FLOAT, FREDDIE.
Hey, DON'T YOU CALL HOMOSEXUALS FRUITS.
don't YOU DARE, WOMAN.
I AM LOVED BY THE HOMOSEXUAL COMMUNITY,
and I FOR ONE--FREDDIE MIGH
I'm GONNA-- I WON'T STAND FOR IT.
you KNOW, SWEETIE, YOUR PUBLICIST GOT YOU A COVER OF OUT.
you KNOW WHY?
they PASSED AT PEOPLE AND US. BIG SHIT, OK?
listen,
I'm STRAIGHT OUT OF THE PARK, BUT I'M NO BIGOT.
Aidan: BIGOTS ALWAYS SAY THAT.
no, LISTEN, BIGOTS ALWAYS SAY THAT.
no, THIS IS NOT PERSONAL.
it's NOT.
I KNOW A LOT OF GAY PEOPLE--MY HAIRDRESSER...
Oh, REALLY? MY STYLIST.
good FOR YOU! SHE DOES.
how ABOUT FATHER FABRIZI FROM ST. SIMON'S? OH, FATHER? HOW IS HE DOING?
he GAVE ME MY FIRST HOLY COMMUNION.
it WAS A FANTASTIC EVENT, JUST FOR YOUR INFORMATION.
but SEE, WE HAVE TO REMEMBER, DARLING, WE HAVE O-OUR FAN BASE.
what ABOUT THE GOD-FEARING PART OF OUR FAN BASE, FREDDIE?
huh?
start THINKIN' LIKE A PRODUCER, SWEETHEART.
this PARADE COULD REALLY HURT YOUR PROGRAM.
I'm GOING BACK TO MY OFFICE, WHERE THERE ARE NO BUZZ-KILLERS.
Sean: UM, FREDDIE. WHAT?!
Freddie. WHAT?!
maybe--maybe ALL YOUR GIRL NEEDS IS
an INVITATION TO SIT UP THERE NEXT TO YOU ON THE
on THE FLOAT.
is THAT IT, PETAL?
well...
is THAT ALL IT IS, BECAUSE, HONEY-- NO, NO,
because IT'S OUR FIRST YEAR, THEY JUST GIVE US A LITTLE, TINY FLOAT.
it's A TINY, LITTLE FLOAT, AND THERE'S ONLY ROOM AT THE TOP FOR ME AND AIDIE, OK?
back TO WORK, EVERYBODY.
Yeah. WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU LOOKIN' AT, HUH?
chop-chop, PEOPLE.
we GOT A CLIT TO BUILD.
julia: OH, MY GOD!
what? WHAT?
Oh, JESUS!
Jesus!
what HA--WHAT? DID I KNOCK YOU OR SOMETHING?
no, IT'S MY THIRD ONE IN 2 DAYS. JESUS.
maybe YOU NEED A HUMIDIFIER IN YOUR ROOM AT THE CHATEAU OR SOMETHING.
no. I DON'T THINK IT'S THE DRYNESS.
you KNOW, SOMETIMES
no. NOSEBLEEDS ARE A SIGN OF ELEVATED BLOOD PRESSURE.
do YOU HAVE A CUFF OR SOMETHING?
come ON. WE BEEN TO AN INTERNIST,
a NEUROLOGIST, A GASTROENTEROLOGIST.
nobody THINKS YOU'RE SICK.
it's BECOMING PRETTY OBVIOUS.
I'm SORRY. WHAT IS BECOMING OBVIOUS? YOU'RE AVOIDING SOMETHING!
you're HIDING BEHIND THESE SYMPTOMS, ALL RIGHT?
I THINK YOU'RE SCARED TO TELL OLIVIA, BECAUSE YOU'RE SCARED OF US.
you FINALLY GET WHAT YOU WANT, AND YOU CAN'T HANDLE IT.
God. CRAZY. YOU ARE JUST
you're SUCH A BULLY.
no. I'M THE ONLY PERSON WHO TELLS YOU THE TRUTH.
look, YOU'RE A GROWN WOMAN, AND YOU'RE ACTING LIKE A NEUROTIC TEENAGER.
you KNOW, QUITE FRANKLY, I'M GETTIN' PISSED OFF.
Yeah, WELL, YOU HAVE CERTAINLY PISSED ME OFF.
Jesus.
look, I'M JUST FRUSTRATED, YOU KNOW.
I JUST F
feel LIKE I'VE WAITED SO LONG, YOU KNOW?
I JUST
I JUST WANT IT TO BE US, YOU KNOW?
can YOU PLEASE FORGIVE ME?
please.
would YOU LIKE YOUR MESSAGES, DR. TROY?
and YOU ARE?
I'm BETINA, YOUR NEW RECEPTIONIST.
Oh.
they're GREAT, RIGHT?
they're NOT BAD.
who DID THEM?
Dr. SACKS.
he's KNOWN FOR PRESERVING FULL SENSITIVITY IN THE NIPPLE AREA.
you NEED TO FIRE THE NEW RECEPTIONIST TODAY.
Why?
she's BRIGHT, WELL EDUCATED,
and SHE'S GOT A GREAT ATTITUDE.
you DIDN'T HIRE HER BECAUSE OF HER M. B.A.
you HIRED HER BECAUSE YOU KNEW THOSE TITS WOULD BE LIKE CATNIP TO ME.
you're TRYIN' TO SABOTAGE ME.
you KNOW, I'LL FALL INTO MY OLD PATTERNS, CHEAT ON JULIA,
our RELATIONSHIP WILL BLOW UP,
and YOU'LL COME SWOOPING IN LIKE SOME KIND OF KNIGHT IN SHINING ARMOR.
I DON'T HAVE TO LIFT A FINGER TO BLOW UP YOUR RELATIONSHIP.
you'll DETONATE IT ALL BY YOURSELF.
don't BE A PETTY BITCH. JUST FIRE HER.
do IT YOURSELF.
I ALREADY TRIPPED OVER THOSE TITS ON MY WAY IN, OK?
she'll FILE FOR SOME KIND OF HARASSMENT SUIT OR SOMETHING.
sucks TO BE YOU, DOESN'T IT?
I've BEEN READING ABOUT SUICIDE BOMBERS.
they SAY MOST OF 'EM ARE EDUCATED, HOLD DOWN JOBS,
and HAVE NO CRIMINAL HISTORY.
they MAKE IT SOUND LIKE ALMOST ANYONE COULD BE A SUICIDE BOMBER UNDER THE RIGHT CIRCUMSTANCES.
well, MOST OF THEM ARE RAISED IN A MISOGYNIST SOCIETY
and LIVE IN CELLS WITH OTHER MEN.
imagine THE THWARTED TESTOSTERONE TOTALLY DEVOID OF LOVE AND AFFECTION,
tenderness, ALL THAT REPRESSION AND BITTERNESS.
kinda LIKE LIFE AT THE MALIBU COMPOUND, HUH?
that IS MY TOOTH.
you KNOW,
we're ALL SMILING THE SECOND BEFORE WE BLOW OURSELVES UP.
we NEED TO CLEAN THIS AREA.
God KNOWS WHAT FILTH THE BOMBER HAD IN HIS MOUTH.
I LOOKED AROUND ME AT ALL THE STUDENTS EATING THEIR LUNCH,
so ARROGANT,
so SURE THAT THIS CAFETERIA BELONGED TO THEM.
this CAFETERIA BUILT ON LAND THAT BELONGED TO ME
was A SOURCE OF HAPPINESS TO THEM.
I LOOKED AT HER SMILING AT ME,
no CARES AT ALL EXCEPT FOR HER OWN SELFISH DESIRE.
just BEFORE I PUSH A DETONATOR,
I ASK ALLAH TO PURIFY MY SPIRIT AND BLESS MY MISSION
so THAT I CAN TAKE OUT AS MANY STUDENTS AS POSSIBLE WITH ME.
and THEN ALL IN AN INSTANT,
an EXQUISITE AND MAJESTIC INSTANT,
all EARTHLY PAIN EXPLODED INTO A MILLION PIECES.
the DOOR TO HEAVEN OPENED,
and I WAS FREE.
[ECHO] I WAS FREE.
come OUT TO THE BEACH. I'LL TAKE A LOOK.
uh, THE SPOT'S INFLAMED? ANY PUS?
well, I TELL YOU WHAT. WHY DON'T YOU LET OLIVIA APPLY THE GODDAMN CALAMINE LOTION?
morning.
would YOU LIKE YOUR MESSAGES?
Yes,
in MY OFFICE.
who ELSE CALLED?
your HAIRSTYLIST.
she SAID IT'S TIME FOR A TRIM, BUT IT LOOKS GOOD TO ME.
And? AND THE HEALTH CLUB CALLED.
God, YOU'RE IN GREAT SHAPE.
Dr. TROY'S OFFICE. CAN YOU HOLD, PLEASE?
Julie CALLED.
she's NOT FEELING GOOD.
Oh, DOCTOR.
Oh, DOCTOR.
it's JULIA...
Yeah. OHH.
not JULIE.
how CAN YOU EVEN CALL YOURSELF A RECEPTIONIST WHEN YOU CAN'T SAY PEOPLE'S NAMES RIGHT?
are YOU?
you're STUPID.
what?
be OUT OF HERE BY LUNCH.
you're FIRED.
Mr. SEIDEL,
Dr. McNAMARA.
pleasure TO MEET YOU. WHY DON'T YOU COME BACK TO MY OFFI
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.
I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT. I JUST
he's STILL INSIDE ME.
he CAN'T STAY INSIDE ME.
OK, I'M GONNA ASK NURSE LINDA TO GIVE YOU A SEDATIVE.
you CAN WAIT COMFORTABLY IN RECOVERY.
I'll GET TO YOU WITHIN THE HOU
No!
think IF A PILL COULD DO THE TRICK, I'D BE HERE?
I HAVEN'T SLEPT IN 4 DAYS.
she SURVIVED THE BLAST,
but I CAN STILL RUIN HER LIFE.
that's OK, DOCTOR.
I CAN WAIT.
thank YOU.
I DON'T KNOW WHO I AM.
I NEVER RAISE MY VOICE.
I'm THE ONE WHO MAKES JOKES TO GET MY WAY.
something's GOING ON I CAN'T CONTROL.
did YOU EVER FEEL LIKE YOUR ANGER WAS A PHYSICAL PRESENCE INSIDE YOU,
like YOU'RE POSSESSED?
OK, OK. TAKE A BREATH. SIT DOWN.
tell ME WHAT'S GOING ON.
after THE EXPLOSION,
there WAS A LOT OF DETRITUS LEFT INSIDE ME,
you KNOW, FRAGMENTS.
the DOCTOR SAID WE DIDN'T NEED TO REMOVE THEM,
that THE METAL SHAVINGS WOULD WORK THEIR WAY OUT NATURALLY OVER TIME.
and SO MANY GREAT THINGS HAPPENED TO ME.
I CAME HERE. I FOUND MY WORK.
I MADE A CERTAIN PEACE WITH MY NEW FACE.
I ACTUALLY HAD HOPE.
you're A SURVIVOR.
you HAVE A POWERFUL SPIRIT.
nothing CAN CHANGE THAT.
and THE CLICHES JUST KEEP ON COMING.
there ARE SOME WOUNDS THAT DO NOT HEAL, YOU KNOW!
you're NOT LISTENING TO ME.
after I FOUND OUT ABOUT THIS TOOTH INSIDE ME,
I DID A BODY SCAN.
I WAS SUDDENLY SURE THE FRAGMENTS INSIDE ME WERE NOT JUST METAL.
I WAS RIGHT.
I AM RIDDLED WITH HIM.
he's HUMAN SHRAPNEL.
SAAED HOTARY'S BONES AND TISSUE ARE INSIDE ME.
his ANGER AND HIS HATRED ARE DESTROYING ME.
please,
take HIM OUT OF ME.
what ARE YOU DOING HERE?
you're BEING RIDICULOUS.
why KEEP HER UNDER FOR TWICE AS LONG WHEN I CAN ASSIST
and CUT THE SURGERY IN HALF?
this SHOULD BE TREATED AS MEDICAL WASTE.
technically THOSE ARE THE REMAINS OF A DEAD PERSON.
I THINK WE SHOULD NOTIFY SOMEBODY.
my MOTHER WOULD LIKE THOSE.
maybe SHE'LL PUT THEM IN AN URN IN THE LIVING ROOM,
and THEY'LL INSPIRE MY LITTLE BROTHER TO FOLLOW ME.
sure. SEND THE BOY'S BONES HOME TO HIS NICE FAMILY.
they MAY BE TERRORISTS,
but, HEY, THEY'RE ONLY HUMAN, DIDN'T I FIRE YOU EARLIER?
she's STILL HERE,
because APPARENTLY YOU MADE AN INAPPROPRIATE SEXUAL OVERTURE.
rather THAN DEAL WITH A LAWSUIT,
I ASKED HER BACK.
could YOU EXCUSE US FOR A MOMENT, PLEASE?
you NEED TO DEAL WITH YOUR RESENTMENT AND ANGER.
what CAN I DO TO MOVE THIS ALONG?
maybe TRY TO AVOID MY SIGHTLINES, DEFINITELY MY SURGERIES
do WE NEED SOME KIND OF MEDIATOR?
no.
you're RIGHT.
I'll WORK SOMETHING OUT WITH BETINA,
some KIND OF PAYOUT,
and I'LL FIND A SUITABLE REPLACEMENT.
good.
Oh. SORRY TO INTERRUPT, BUT, UH...
dawn BUDGE AND HER FIANCE ARE IN YOUR OFFICE.
they're IN MY OFFICE.
she's MY FRIEND.
I'm OUT FOR BLOOD.
that LAME LEZZIE IS GONNA REGRET GETTIN'OUT OF BED AND GETTIN' ON HER HARLEY,
let ME TELL YOU.
I FEEL LIKE THIS IS ALL MY FAULT.
this HAPPENED AT THE GAY PRIDE PARADE?
can YOU BELIEVE IT?
something SO TERRIBLE ON SUCH A BEAUTIFUL DAY.
everybody WAS--WAS BURSTING WITH JOY, CREATIVITY,
the FREEDOM TO--TO BE THEMSELVES.
I GUESS I JUST GOT CAUGHT UP WITH THE FANS.
you CERTAINLY DID GET CAUGHT UP.
the HEARTS 'N SCALPELS FLOAT WAS NEXT TO LAST.
I WAS BEHIND THE PROTESTORS.
you WERE PROTESTING?
dawn, WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?
I SAID I WAS BEHIND THE PROTESTORS, DR. TROY,
not A PROTESTOR.
I ALSO WANTED TO BE CLOSE BY JUST IN CASE, YOU KNOW,
he GOT DOSED AND TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF.
dosed? YEAH.
roofies OR SOME SHIT.
I WAS NEVER IN ANY DANGER OF BEING DRUGGED BY THE GAYS.
I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT VIOLATION DID NOT OCCUR ON MY WATCH.
I WAS SO CONCERNED ABOUT FREDDIE'S REPUTATION,
what WITH THE TELEVISION CAMERA CREWS AND ALL,
that I FAILED TO NOTICE THE APPROACHING DEADLY POSSE OF LADIES ON THEIR HOGS VROOMIN' BY ME.
Freddie! GET YOUR--FREDDIE!
keep YOUR SHIRT
let ME
she PURPOSEFULLY RAN ME OVER.
back UP, PEOPLE. BACK UP.
back UP.
give HER SOME AIR. GET BACK.
Dawn: I'M GONNA TAKE HER HOUSE.
I'm GOING TO TAKE HER POWER TOOLS.
I'm GONNA TAKE HER K. D. LANG CDs.
if YOU RAN RIGHT IN FRONT OF HER, DAWN,
I CAN'T IMAGINE SHE DID IT ON PURPOSE.
and, SWEETHEART, SHE FELT TERRIBLE.
she WAS SO UPSET, SHE WAS CRYING.
who IS THE INJURED PARTY HERE?
I THINK DAWN'S OUTRAGE IS PERFECTLY UNDERSTANDABLE.
she's GOT A FACE FULL OF GRAVEL.
she's LUCKY SHE'S NOT HEMORRHAGING INTERNALLY.
why IS THE ONUS ON HER TO FORGIVE?
Bravo, DOCTOR.
it's A START.
OK, CAMILLE.
if THIS DOESN'T MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER...
then I'M NO DOCTOR.
sushi. MY FAVORITE.
Oh, JUST A SIP FOR ME.
a SIP. T THANK YOU.
complain AWAY IF YOU NEED TO I'M ALL EARS.
and I PROMISE NOTHING YOU SAY IS BORING.
how ARE YOU FEELING, JULIA?
Oh. I'M FINE. UM, BETTER.
christian BROUGHT HOME SUSHI.
come ON. SIT DOWN, BUDDY. HAVE SOME SAKE.
actually, I, UH
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU GUYS.
good.
we SHOULD TALK.
you TWO NEED YOUR SPACE.
I've DECIDED TO MOVE OUT.
there WAS THIS SENSATIONALLY TALENTED YOUNG MAN.
he WAS ALL DRESSED UP LIKE CHER,
and HE WAS SINGING IF YOU COULD TURN BACK TIME.
I SWEAR TO GOD I THOUGHT IT WAS HER.
it WAS UNCANNY.
I--I WISH YOU'D HAVE BEEN
mom, I'VE GOTTA CALL YOU BACK. I LOVE YOU.
how's MY DAWNIE?
Oh, SHE'S AS GOOD AS NEW.
she's A LITTLE GROGGY.
you WANNA COME SEE HER?
of COURSE I DO.
you LOOK GOOD.
I SAW YOU AT THE PARADE.
I WAS THERE.
Really?
Oh, YEAH.
you WERE HAPPY LIKE A PIG IN SHIT.
you WERE FEELIN' THE PRIDE, HUH?
Oh, AND I DO.
I-I'm SO PROUD OF OUR SHOW,
and--and THE GAYS,
they've JUST BEEN WONDERFUL, THE WAY THEY'VE EMBRACED US.
look INTO MY EYES AND TELL ME THAT YOU ARE NOT GAY.
um, YOU'RE LOOKIN' AWAY.
excu--excuse ME, BUT, UM
aren't YOU SICK OF HOLDING IT ALL IN?
don't YOU WANNA BLOW IT SKY-HIGH AND BE WHO YOU REALLY ARE?
if YOU COULD HAVE SEEN YOURSELF ON THAT FLOAT.
you WERE BEAUTIFUL.
no
do YOU HAVE ANY TAKEOUT MENUS AT THIS CLINIC?
um, DAWNIE AND I HAVE BEEN THROUGH SUCH A TRAUMATIC EVENT,
and WE NEED A SNACK, A YUMMY SNACK.
the REMAINS OF SAAED HOTARY.
a SUICIDE BOMBER.
my MOTHER'S STILL MOURNING THE FACT
that I DON'T LOOK LIKE NATALIE PORTMAN ANYMORE.
and I KNOW YOUR MOTHER'S REALLY PROUD.
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE EASIER ONCE HE WAS OUT OF ME.
that's WHY YOU'RE RETURNING THE REMAINS TO HIS FAMILY, ISN'T IT?
look, HOPEFULLY THIS CAN BE THE LAST CHAPTER, RACHEL,
forgiveness.
I HOPE SO.
no, FORGETTING IS EASY.
forgiveness IS...
is REALLY, REALLY HARD.
you DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS, YOU KNOW.
it's NOT REQUIRED. NO, I MADE A COMMITMENT TO MYSELF.
I'm IN AWE OF YOUR EFFORTS, RACHEL.
I REALLY AM.
these ARE HIS PARENTS--FAYED AND REEM HOTARY, 314 JERUSALEM ROAD, RAMALLAH, PALESTINE.
a HATE CRIME IS WHEN A PERPETRATOR TARGETS A VICTIM
because OF HIS OR HER MEMBERSHIP IN A CERTAIN SOCIAL GROUP,
which IS DEFINED BY RACE, RELIGION--" THANK YOU.
ethnicity, GENDER IDENTITY, OR POLITICAL AFFILIATION.
honey,
I WAS TARGETED BY A HETEROPHOBIC,
right, FREDDIE?
I MEAN, THINK ABOUT IT. IT'S RIGHT THERE.
Oh, SPEAK OF THE DEVIL.
look WHO HAS THE NERVE TO SHOW UP HERE.
Freddie, IT IS HER.
it IS HER, THE WOMAN WHO RAN OVER MY FACE
and MADE IT LOOK LIKE LUNCHMEAT. FREDDIE.
well,
shame ON YOU, SISTER. UM...
dawn AND FREDDIE, YOU ARE BEING RIDICULOUS.
this WOMAN IS NOT HANNIBAL LECTER.
her NAME IS JAN TOONEY,
and SHE SHOWED UP ASKING IF SHE COULD SPEAK TO YOU.
you NEED TO LISTEN TO WHAT SHE HAS TO SAY.
you ARE TAKIN' ADVANTAGE OF MY KIND AND GENEROUS NATURE, LIZ.
fine. YOU GOT 3 MINUTES, HONEY, AND IT BETTER BE GOOD.
I--I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME.
to BEGIN WITH, I'M VERY SORRY.
see, WHAT HAPPENED WAS
is MY BIKE'S A CROTCH ROCKET, YOU KNOW,
real FAST,
and I TOLD 'EM I WAS HAVIN' CLUTCH PROBLEMS
and THAT I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T BE UP FRONT,
in CASE SOMETHIN' LIKE THIS HAPPENED, WHICH IT DID.
a BAD CLUTCH?
a LAME LIE IF I EVER HEARD ONE.
well, MY MISTAKE WAS LETTIN' MY PRIDE IN MY BIKE CLOUD MY JUDGMENT.
I SHOULD HAVE SAID NO.
see, THE THING IS--IS I'VE GOT A KID.
her NAME'S FELICITY.
what, IS SHE ONE OF THOSE TURKEY-BASTER BABIES?
what?
that's NOT NICE.
believe IT OR NOT, I WAS MARRIED.
I--I WAS A SOCCER MOM IN MY PREVIOUS LIFE, AND I
anyway,
she GOT ACCEPTED EARLY ADMISSIONS TO YALE,
and SHE'S A GOOD KID. SHE'S A GOOD GIRL,
and SHE WORKED REAL HARD TO GET IN,
and SO IF YOU SUE ME, SHE'S THE ONE WHO GETS SCREWED.
well, MAYBE YOU SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT THAT
before YOU ACCELERATED OVER MY FACE.
sweetheart, I THINK WE ALL KNOW BY NOW THAT MS.
Tooney DID NOT ACCELERATE ON PURPOSE.
whose SIDE ARE YOU ON, FREDDIE?
w--I JUST--THIS IS
so UNLIKE YOU.
I've NEVER SEEN YOU LIKE THIS. IT
you're SIMPLY NOT YOURSELF.
is IT POSSIBLE THAT YOU ARE ANGRY AT SOMEBODY ELSE
and ARE ACTING IT OUT ON THIS POOR LADY?
someone LIKE ME, FOR INSTANCE?
why WOULD I BE ANGRY AT YOU, OK, YOU KNOW WHAT, JAN?
let's GIVE THEM A MINUTE. OK?
dawn, I THINK YOU'RE STRUGGLING WITH A SUBCONSCIOUS FEAR THAT I'M GAY
that YOU'RE SUBLIMATING INTO A VENDETTA AGAINST JAN TOONEY. THERE. I SAID IT.
subconscious? HONEY,
I've BEEN DREADIN' THIS DAY SINCE THE MOMENT I FELL IN LOVE WITH YOU,
and I KNEW IF YOU WENT TO THAT GAY PARADE,
that WOULD BE THE END OF US.
I--I NEVER IMAGINED IT WOULD BE SUCH A GLORIOUS AND PROFOUND EVENT.
all THE DANCING AND THE MUSIC AND THE FEATHERS
and ALL THESE BEAUTIFUL SOULS WAVING AT ME
and SENDING ME SO MUCH LOVE,
and THEY ALL JUST SEEMED SO BRAVE
and SO UNAFRAID TO BE WHO THEY WERE.
I FELT THIS PROFOUND SENSE OF FREEDOM,
and ALL OF A SUDDEN,
my PEOPLE'S CHOICE AWARD JUST WASN'T THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN MY LIFE ANYMORE,
and THAT'S WHEN THE LIGHT BULB WENT ON.
the GAY LIGHT BULB.
Oh, HONEY.
how DID YOU KNOW BEFORE I DID?
it's THE STORY OF MY LIFE, SWEETIE.
you're NOT THE FIRST ONE.
I BEEN FALLIN' IN LOVE WITH GAY BOYS SINCE HIGH SCHOOL, YOU KNOW.
they WERE THE ONLY ONES WHO SEEMED TO GET ME.
they WOULD LAUGH AT ALL OF MY JOKES,
spend TIME GIVIN' ME MAKEOVERS.
Oh, FOR HOURS, WE WOULD LISTEN TO MY STREISAND RECORDS.
I KNEW YOU WERE TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE.
really,
but
I WAS JUST SO LONELY.
I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU.
I DON'T DESERVE YOUR LOVE, FREDDIE.
Oh, YES, YOU DO.
I REALLY DON'T.
I TALK A GOOD GAME ABOUT UNCONDITIONAL LOVE,
but YOU KNOW, I SPEND MY NIGHTS AT A CHURCH
lightin' A CANDLE, PRAYIN' TO GOD THAT YOU DON'T COME OUT OF THE CLOSET.
what KIND OF LOVE IS THAT?
and I'M NOT A HOMOPHOBIC PERSON, FREDDIE. I'M NOT.
I'm JUST JEALOUS, YOU KNOW.
all YOU GUYS,
you SEEM TO KNOW WHERE YOU BELONG,
where YOU FIT,
what CLUB YOU'RE A MEMBER OF,
but ME,
I'm NOT SO SURE.
Aw, SWEETIE.
I WISH I COULD TAKE YOUR PAIN AWAY.
that's JUST WHAT TONY FAMIGLIANO SAID WHEN HE LEFT ME FOR THE TIGHT END.
Hey, ASSHOLE.
to WHAT SHITTY TWIST OF FATE DO I OWE THIS EXTREME DISPLEASURE?
Sean CALLED.
he OFFERED ME THE JOB OF RECEPTIONIST.
Gina FITS THE JOB DESCRIPTION PERFECTLY, IF YOU RECALL YOUR MANDATE.
Oh, YOU MEAN SOMEONE SO HIDEOUS THAT I'D NEVER EVEN IN THE PAIN OF DEATH BE TEMPTED TO SCREW THEM.
that MANDATE?
who WANTS TO SCREW YOU, ASSHOLE?
I JUST GOT MY CALIFORNIA REAL ESTATE LICENSE,
and I THOUGHT WHAT BETTER PLACE TO MEET CLIENTS THAN IN YOUR LOBBY.
Oh. WELL, WHY DON'T YOU START OFF BY MEETING PEOPLE DOWN AT THE CARWASH?
my LAMBORGHINI NEEDS DETAILING.
sure. YOUR WISH IS MY COMMAND, BOSS.
you KNOW WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT HOLDING A GRUDGE?
it's LIKE TAKING POISON EXPECTING THE OTHER PERSON TO DIE.
I THOUGHT GINA WAS A STROKE OF GENIUS.
not ONLY IS SHE NOT SCREWABLE,
but YOU'VE GOT BUILT-IN CHILD-CARE.
you AND MY EX-WIFE CAN HAVE MORE ALONE TIME.
Oh, WHY DON'T YOU STOP BEING SUCH A BITCHY LITTLE CHEERLEADER, ALL RIGHT?
let's GET IT ALL OUT RIGHT NOW, HUH?
just SAY IT TO MY FACE. COME ON.
nothing I WANNA SAY.
you're SUCH A PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE LITTLE SHIT, AREN'T YOU?
you CAN'T EVEN SAY IT, CAN YOU?
you CAN'T EVEN SAY IT, CAN YOU? YOU CAN'T SAY IT.
come ON. SAY IT. I'M DONE HERE.
say IT. YOU'RE NOT DONE HERE. DO NOT TOUCH ME.
I'm SICK OF YOUR HOLIER-THAN-THOU BULLSHIT.
I'm NOT GONNA APOLOGIZE
she's ALL YOURS! JUST BOTH OF YOU LEAVE ME ALONE!
we GOTTA DEAL WITH THIS, SEAN.
just AN ASSHOLE.
what IS GOING--STOP IT! WHAT IS GOING ON?! STOP!
Oh, MY GOD! IDIOTS, STOP! STOP!
stop!
damn IT, BOYS.
Liz: YOU WANNA TAKE ANY OF THESE?
Aw, NO. THEY'RE ALL FROM FREDDIE.
just MAKES ME SAD, REALLY.
you CAN HAVE WHATEVER YOU WANT.
listen,
do YOU MIND IF WE MAKE A LITTLE STOP HERE?
just WANNA SHOW YOU SOMETHIN.
all RIGHT.
just--just OPEN THAT FOR ME IF YOU DON'T MIND.
state-of-the-art HOG.
I KNOW THAT YOU FEEL GUILTY ABOUT YOUR BEHAVIOR,
but I HAVE A NEWS FLASH FOR YOU.
not ALL LESBIANS RIDE MOTORCYCLES.
I NEVER GOT PAST MY TRAINING WHEELS.
I KNOW I OWE YOU AN APOLOGY, LIZ, BUT THE BIKE AIN'T FOR YOU.
it's FOR JAN TOONEY.
you GOTTA BE KIDDIN'.
no, IT IS,
and IT'S A NICE ONE, TOO, SO TELL HER NO WHEELIES, OK,
whatsoever. GO AHEAD. LOOK AT THE CARD.
$30, 000? $30, 000?
a YEAR'S TUITION AT YALE.
I COULDN'T PUT MY OWN KID THROUGH COLLEGE, SO WHAT THE HELL?
listen,
Liz, I KNOW I HAVEN'T BEEN REALLY GRACIOUS WITH YOU, SO ...
there's SOMETHIN' I GOTTA DO.
the BAD JUJU'LL RUIN YOUR HEALTH. I KNOW THAT.
I HOPE THAT YOU CAN FORGIVE ME, TOO.
I REALLY DIDN'T MEAN THOSE THINGS I SAID ABOUT YOU.
I SHOULD HOPE NOT.
it WAS MAKING ME FEEL VERY UNCOMFORTABLE.
it WAS LIKE I WAS WALKIN' AROUND WITH A HOSTILE KIDNEY.
come ON, LISTEN. I GOT A NEW IDEA I WANNA TELL YOU ABOUT.
all RIGHT. WHAT? I'M THINKIN' OF PUTTIN' MY CONSIDERABLE WEALTH AND STYLE BEHIND THE
you KNOW PFLAG? YEAH.
the PARENTS AND FRIENDS... RIGHT.
of THE LEZZIES AND THE GAYS. RIGHT.
well, I'M THINKIN' OF DOIN'ODFLAG.
ODFLAG. "ORGAN DONORS
is WHAT THE O. D. IS FOR.
Oh, THAT IS BRILLIANT, DAWN.
Yes, THANK YOU,
because I THINK ALL OF US WHO HAVE GIVEN OUR BODY PARTS, OUR HEARTS,
and OUR SOUL TO YOU GAYS, WE COULD ALL GET TOGETHER.
I THINK WE'RE LOOKING AT 6 OR 7 SURGERIES TO RESTORE YOUR FACE.
we'd DO A BONE GRAFT FROM YOUR SKULL TO REBUILD THE NOSE,
but WE'D START BY INSERTING TISSUE EXPANDERS --WHAT, MATT?
dad, COME ON. YOU LOOK LIKE YOU JUST WENT 10 ROUNDS WITH MIKE TYSON.
you SHOULD SEE THE OTHER GUY.
Yeah, NO, I TALKED TO CHRISTIAN.
I KNOW THE WHOLE STORY.
look, I
I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT THAT MUST BE LIKE FOR YOU.
I MEAN, CHRISTIAN BEING WITH MOM NOW?
it's HARD EVEN FOR ME,
but STILL, YOU GUYS HAVE GOT TO DEAL WITH THIS LIKE ADULTS.
I APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERN, MATT,
but WE'RE NOT HERE TO TALK ABOUT ME.
we're HERE TO TALK ABOUT RACHEL. SO ...
let's TALK ABOUT THE FINANCIAL END OF THIS.
people IN YOUR LINE OF WORK ARE FAMOUSLY UNDERPAID.
Yeah, NO, I TOLD HER YOU MIGHT BE WILLING TO DO THIS PRO BONO.
Matt, I CAN SPEAK FOR MYSELF.
look. DAD,
if EVER THERE WAS SOMEBODY WORTHY
I MEAN, SHE'S BECOME SUCH AN INSPIRATION FOR OTHERS AND ESPECIALLY FOR ME.
Matt, I'D LIKE TO SPEAK WITH RACHEL ALONE.
could YOU GIVE US A MINUTE?
OK. UH, I'LL BE OUTSIDE.
between US,
what ARE YOUR EXPECTATIONS FROM THIS SERIES OF SURGERIES?
SOMETHING'S, UM...
shifted IN ME SINCE MY BOMBER'S GONE, DR. McNAMARA.
I've BEGUN TO THINK ABOUT A REAL LIFE.
I've ACTUALLY ALLOWED MYSELF TO HAVE FANTASIES ABOUT A LIFE WITH LOVE IN IT, YOU KNOW.
are YOU IN LOVE WITH MATT?
is HE IN LOVE WITH YOU?
we DON'T DISCUSS THINGS LIKE THAT.
we're JUST GOOD FRIENDS.
facial RECONSTRUCTION IS A LONG, PAINFUL ROAD
filled WITH HUGE PSYCHOLOGICAL CHALLENGES.
you've HAD SO MUCH PAIN ALREADY IN YOUR LIFE, SO MUCH BRUTALITY.
I GUESS I JUST WANNA BE CERTAIN THAT YOUR EXPECTATIONS ARE REALISTIC.
you NEED TO BE HONEST WITH YOURSELF WHETHER YOU'RE DOING THIS FOR YOU
or SOMEONE ELSE.
listen, YOUR SON'S A GREAT GUY,
but HE'S NOT THE ONLY FISH IN THE SEA.
as FAR AS PAIN GOES, I'M NOT AFRAID.
I've LIVED THROUGH THE WORST THERE IS.
the PAIN OF BEING BETRAYED BY SOMEONE YOU LOVE
could IN SOME WAYS BE WORSE THAN PHYSICAL PAIN.
that's WHAT YOUR BLACK EYE'S ABOUT, ISN'T IT,
a BETRAYAL?
because I'LL TELL YOU,
when I SENT THOSE REMAINS OFF TO PALESTINE,
I SLEPT THROUGH THE NIGHT FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE EXPLOSION.
the TRICK
is FORGIVING THE UNFORGIVABLE.
let ME DO THAT.
remember WHEN WE MOVED INTO THE DORM ROOM JUNIOR YEAR
and WE DROPPED THAT 400-POUND DESK ON MY FOOT?
you WERE SUCH A BABY,
screaming, CARRYING ON.
you WERE THE FIRST PERSON WHO EVER REALLY LOOKED OUT FOR ME.
my MOM COULD HANDLE ONLY SO MUCH WHEN MY DAD LEFT.
you CARRIED ME INTO THAT EMERGENCY ROOM.
I FELT SO COVERED,
like YOU WERE THE BROTHER I NEVER HAD.
then JULIA SHOWED UP WITH MARGARITAS
camouflaged IN COFFEE CUPS.
you're A BETRAYING SON OF A BITCH, CHRISTIAN...
but YOU STILL ARE MY BROTHER,
and I KNOW YOU'RE JUST TRYIN' TO BE HAPPY.
I SEE YOU HAVE RACHEL BEN NATAN ON THE SCHEDULE.
it's A BIG SURGERY.
maybe YOU COULD USE AN EXTRA SET OF HANDS.
Yes, I COULD.
>> MR. McNAMARA, I'M COLLEEN ROSE OF THE COLLEEN ROSE AGENCY.
you HAVE A VERY LETURALISTIC PROCESS.
at MESK YOU SOMETHING.
what DO YOU THINK OF THESE?
Colleen, THIS IS INAPPROPRIATE.
Hey, ASSHOLE, SEAN CALLED.
he OFFERED ME THE JOB OF RECEPTIONIST.
I DON'T WANT YOU NEAR MY WORK EVER AGAIN.
I KNOW YOU WANT IT, CHRISTIAN.
Uhh! THIS IS LOVE.
Gina: UNH! AHH! THIS IS LOVE.
have YOU DECIDED WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO WITH GINA'S BODY?
why DO YOU KEEP ASKING ME THAT? I'M NOT HER NEXT OF KIN.
are YOU JOINING ME FOR OUR 10: 00?
I JUST NEED TO GET MY SHIT TOGETHER, OK? JUST GIVE ME A SEC. JUST...
so TELL ME WHAT YOU DON'T LIKE ABOUT YOURSELF. I'M SORRY.
I'm NOT SURE WHICH ONE OF YOU IS HERE FOR THE CONSULT.
that WOULD BE ME. WE JUST GOT BACK FROM OUR HONEYMOON,
and, WELL, IT, UH-IT DIDN'T GO QUITE AS WE HAD PLANNED.
Oh, BET IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME.
I MEAN, THE PRESSURE ALONE IS ENOUGH TO KILL YOUR LIBIDO.
that's NOT EXACTLY WHAT I MEANT.
we WERE GOIN' UP TO THE MOUNTAINS, THE OREGON COAST RANGSOINSNOWING HARD.
uh, IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE ANYTHING,
and I TOOK A WRONG TURN, WENT DOWN A RAVINE, UH, 20 FEET.
our CAR WAS ON ITS SIDE, COMPLETELY BURIED IN SNOW.
we WERE TRAPPED INSIDE FOR 10 DAYS.
but YOU SURVIVED, WHICH IS A MIRACLE,
and IF YOUR MARRIAGE CAN SURVIVE THAT, IT'S A PRETTY GOOD SIGN.
and YOU'RE HERE BECAUSE...
well, I DON'T REMEMBER MUCH.
IT'S-UH, I MUST HAVE BEEN KNOCKED UNCONSCIOUS OR SOMETHING.
I- I JUST REMEMBER WAKIN' UP WITH THIS INCREDIBLE PAIN AND, UH,
these HUGE GOUGES TAKEN OUT OF MY ARM.
the TRIM FROM THE DASH CUT RIGHT THROUGH IT.
Ah. TENDONS ARE OK. MUSCLE'S UNDAMAGED. YOU'RE LUCKY.
the CUT'S PRETTY, UM-THE TRIM FROM THE DASHBOARD DID THIS?
tell THEM THE TRUTH, KYLE.
honey. I HAVE TO TELL THEM, TELL SOMEBODY WHAT YOU DID.
the GUILT IS-I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE.
we HAD-NO FOOD, NO WATER. I'M
I'm SEVERELY HYPOGLYCEMIC.
we TRIED TEXT MESSAGING TILL THE CELL BATTERY RAN OUT, BUT NO HELP CAME.
after A WEEK, SHE STARTED TO COMPLAIN OF HEADACHES AND DIZZINESS,
and EVENTUALLY SHE STARTED TO LOSE MOTOR CONTROL.
I STARTED HEARING NOISES,
and MY-MY EYES WOULDN'T FOCUS.
I COULD ONLY SEE THESE SPOTS.
I THOUGHT SHE WAS GONNA DIE.
I THOUGHT WE BOTH WERE GONNA DIE.
he SAVED ME. HE, UH-GOUGED OUT SMALL PIECES OF HIS FLESH,
warmed THEM WITH THE CAR LIGHTER, AND FED THEM TO ME.
I WAS LIKE A-LIKE A CANNIBAL EATING MY OWN HUSBAND TO SURVIVE.
what KIND OF PERSON AM I?
I- I THINK I'M GONNA-I'M GONNA BE SICK.
she COULDN'T HAVE LASTED WITHOUT SOMETHING TO EAT,
and I DIDN'T WANT TO LOSE HER.
I DID NOT KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO.
you MUST THINK I'M A MONSTER,
but YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU WOULD DO TO SURVIVE
until IT HAPPENS TO YOU. PLEASE.
please F-FIX MY HUSBAND.
I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE GINA KILLED HERSELF.
seemed LIKE SHE WAS DOIN' SO WELL.
Liz: WELL, HAPPENS TO A LOT OF SUICIDAL PERSONALITIES.
things GET GOOD. THE BAD FEELINGS DON'T GO AWAY. ALL HOPE IS LOST,
and THEN SPLAT. HOW IS WILBER HANDLING THIS?
fine. HE TOOK IT HARD AT FIRST, BUT...
kid's A SURVIVOR.
I OWE GINA FOR WILBER, BUT BESIDES THAT,
she's NOTHING BUT A CHRONIC HEMORRHOID.
every TIME I THOUGHT SHE WAS GONE,
she'd FLARE UP AGAIN AND BE A PAIN IN MY ASS.
here. HAND HIM OVER.
Why? WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'?
I'll CLOSE. IT'S ALMOST NOON.
why DON'T YOU GO PICK WILBER UP FROM SCHOOL?
your SON NEEDS YOU RIGHT NOW MORE THAN I DO.
can I HELP YOU?
he's MY SON, WILBER.
I'm DR. TROY.
Oh. SO THE PRINCIPAL CALLED YOU ALREADY?
about WHAT?
well, UH, THERE WAS AN INCIDENT TODAY WITH YOUR SON.
he BIT ANOTHER STUDENT, YEAH, DURING STRETCH AND GROW.
I GUESS OWEN GOT TOO CLOSE TO WILBER'S MAT.
Jesus. IS THE OTHER BOY OK?
Oh. WELL, YOU KNOW, AT THIS AGE, THEY FORGET ALL ABOUT IT 20 MINUTES LATER.
we HAVE A BIGGER PROBLEM, THOUGH.
uh, SCHOOL POLICY REQUIRES THAT WILBER BE EXPELLED.
Yeah, IT'S IN THE ENROLLMENT CONTRACT THAT YOU SIGNED-PERSONAL CONDUCT.
you CAN SPEAK TO THE PRINCIPAL, BUT
is HE AWARE THAT WILBER'S MOTHER DIED A FEW DAYS AGO?
Oh, MY GOD. I HAD NO IDEA.
what-what HAPPENED?
she JUMPED OFF THE BALCONY.
suicide.
you HAVEN'T TOLD HIM?
no.
Oh, WELL, NO WONDER HE'S ACTING OUT.
he's PROBABLY SO CONFUSED BY HER SUDDEN ABSENCE IN HIS LIFE, SCARED.
you NEED TO TELL HIM WHAT HAPPENED.
he's TOO YOUNG TO UNDERSTAND.
Oh, WELL, HE MIGHT NOT HAVE THE VERBAL SKILLS,
but HE CAN CERTAINLY SENSE SUCH A BIG CHANGE.
look, I'LL TALK TO THE PRINCIPAL.
I'm SURE THE SCHOOL WILL MAKE AN EXCEPTION, GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES.
but YOU NEED TO TELL WILBER THAT HIS MOTHER IS GONE FOR EVERYONE'S SAFETY.
come ON. DO IT FOR ME.
wait, COME ON. YOU CAN DO IT.
Colleen, THIS IS AWKWARD.
well, I'VE HEARD ABOUT IT, AND I-I WANNA HEAR IT.
I MEAN, I THINK I DESERVE THE FULL McNAMARA CHARM.
OK. TELL ME WHAT YOU DON'T LIKE ABOUT YOURSELF.
so GOOD.
the OLD HAMMERTOE, WHICH I GOT FROM POUNDING
the PAVEMENT ON YOURS AND MY OTHER CLIENTS' BEHALF.
hold STILL, PLEASE. I SEE THERE ARE SEVERAL TOES
that ARE QUITE RIGID AND SOME CALLUSES.
OK. NOW, CHECK THOSE OUT.
it's GONNA BE A GREAT AWARDS SEASON FOR HEARTS 'N SCALPELS,
and I REFUSE TO WALKDOWN THE RED CARPET IN A PAIR OF GODDAMN EASY SPIRITS.
now, I READ ABOUT THIS SURGERY IN THE NEW ALLURE.
it's AS HOT AS YOUR CAREER.
so YOU SHAVE THE BONES.
they SHORTEN THE TOES, THEY FUSE THE TENDONS, AND THEY PEEL THE SKIN.
it's NOTHIN' TO IT, RIGHT?
I DO WANT YOU TO LOOK YOUR BEST, COLLEEN.
it's IN MY BEST INTEREST THAT YOU DO.
I DO FEEL HOWEVER THAT WE HAVE A PROPER
and FAIR FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENT AND GOOD PROFESSIONAL BOUNDARIES, WHICH
whoa. HOLD IT RIGHT THERE, COOKIE.
you THINK I'M ASKING FOR A FREEBIE?
never.
all RIGHT? I'M THE PATIENT.
you're THE PRO.
just LIKE YOU'RE A CLIENT, AND I'M A PRO.
so LET'S GET THIS SURGERY ON THE BOOK.
Oh, MY GOD. HOW CUTE DO YOU LOOK HOLDING THOSE SHOES.
what YA DOIN', BUDDY?
playing MY T-REX. HE BITES HARD, LIKE THIS.
wilber, NO. IT'S NOT NICE TO BITE.
we DON'T DO THAT IN THIS HOUSE, OK, OR AT SCHOOL.
but I KNOW WHY YOU'RE DOING IT.
you're UPSET BECAUSE YOUR MOMMY'S GONE AWAY AGAIN. RIGHT?
I MISS MOMMY.
OK, HERE'S THE DEAL.
you're MY SON, AND I LOVE YOU,
and I'M GONNA BE HONEST WITH YOU ALWAYS, OK?
mommy's NOT COMING BACK, BECAUSE...
daddy KILLED HER.
I- I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.
I- DADDY WAS HORNY AND TIRED AND NEEDED TO GET HIS ROCKS OFF.
you'll UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT WHEN YOU'RE OLDER.
and MOMMY OFFERED HIM CHEAP SEX,
and LIKE A FOOL, DADDY ACCEPTED.
basically I-I SCREWED HER OFF THE BALCONY,
and SHE FELL TO HER DEATH, AND I HAVEN'T TOLD YOU OR ANYBODY ELSE,
because I DON'T WANT THE POLICE INVOLVED,
because THEN DADDY COULD GO TO JAIL,
and THEN I WOULDN'T BE WITH YOU,
and I'M NOT GONNA LET THAT HAPPEN.
is MOMMY A SKANK?
Yes, HONEY. SHE WAS.
she WAS A BAD PERSON AND A BAD MOMMY,
maybe THIS IS ALL FOR THE BEST,
so IT'S JUST YOU AND ME, LIKE IT'S MEANT TO BE.
play WITH ME, DADDY.
I MISS MOMMY.
she BUYS ME ICE CREAM.
when's MOMMY COMING BACK?
mommy TOOK A LONG TRIP, HONEY,
you KNOW, LIKE BEFORE.
mommy's NOT COMING BACK FOR A LONG TIME.
what WERE YOU TWO GABBIN' ABOUT?
Oh, SORRY, SEAN. I SHOULD HAVE WAITED BEFORE I SENT HER INTO LA-LA LAND,
but THE WOMAN IS A FORCE OF NATURE, AND SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHEN TO STOP.
Yeah. I'VE BEEN THERE.
and SHE'S VERY EXCITED ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE DOIN' FOR HER.
this ISN'T PRO BONO.
she's PAYING FOR IT.
no, NOT THIS,
but THIS TAKIN' HER TO ALL THE AWARD SHOWS THIS WINTER.
Yeah. ARE YOU REALLY GOIN' TO THE OSCARS?
no, SHE MUST HAVE MEANT ONE OF HER OTHER CLIENTS.
hmm. I DON'T THINK SO.
it's HAMMER TIME. HIT IT.

but NOT EVEN I CAN FIGURE OUT HOW TO PUT THIS HUMPTY DUMPTY BACK TOGETHER AGAIN.
can I PICK YOUR BRAIN?
sure.
so, DOC, HELP ME OUT HERE.
as YOU CAN SEE, THE LEFT SIDE OF MS. RUSSO'S FACE,
the POINT OF IMPACT, HAS JUST BEEN SHATTERED BEYOND RECOGNITION.
there's NO CHEEKBONE, NO JAW STRUCTURE TO PROP UP.
try A VITALLIUM RECOM PLATE FOR THE LEFT MANDIBLE.
this WILL GIVE YOU SOME ARCHITECTURE TO MANIPULATE.
there's NO STABLE FIXATION POINT.
the WHOLE SIDE'S LIKE SMUCKER'S JELLY.
Dr. TROY, I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHING ELSE I CAN DO FOR HER.
I THINK WE'RE TALKIN'CLOSED CASKET HERE.
you WANT A MINUTE?
for ALL THE TIMES I'VE WANTED TO KILL YOU...
this WASN'T ONE OF THEM.
hello.
his HEART SUDDENLY DROPPED FROM 74 TO 140.
he's BEEN LABILE FOR THE PAST HALF AN HOUR.
fever? 105.
Sean: HIS HEART RATE'S STABILIZED AT 90,
but HIS B. P.KEEPS BOTTOMING OUT.
get HIS CHART. MAYBE HE'S ON SOME MEDICATION WE'RE NOT AWARE OF.
Oh, HE DOESN'T TAKE ANYTHING.
he's NEVER BEEN SICK A DAY-NOW YOU FIX THIS.
maybe THOSE INSTRUMENTS YOU USED WEREN'T STERILE. I READ ABOUT THAT.
I ASSURE YOU WE STERILIZE EVERYTHING.
I CAN'T LOSE HIM.
I'll KILL MYSELF IF SOMETHING HAPPENS TO HIM.
can YOU HEAR ME? BABE?
Mrs. AINGE, YOUR HUSBAND IS IN SOME KIND OF SEPTIC SHOCK.
if YOU WANT HIM TO PULL THROUGH THIS,
you're GONNA HAVE TO WAIT OUTSIDE.
you UNDERSTAND?
let's START HIM ON A DOPAMINE DRIP, 10 MICS.
have SOME EPHEDRINE STANDING BY.
he's LOSING BLOOD PRESSURE.
how's IT GOING, COLLEEN?
what's THE MATTER, COOKIE?
minor TROUBLE WITH ANOTHER PATIENT. HE'S STABILIZED.
Oh, WELL, HE'LL LIVE. I MEAN, YOU ARE A GENIUS.
your WORK IS JUST GODDAMN BRILLIANT.
I COULD HAVE A SECOND CAREER AS A FOOT MODEL. SERIOUSLY.
well, YOU SEEM TO BE HEALING PERFECTLY,
so I'LL JUST CHECK IN LATER.
look WHAT I MADE YOU.
it's A SEAN BEAR. HEY, LOOK.
tell ME WHAT YOU DON'T LIKE ABOUT YOURSELF.
I RECORDED IT DURING OUR CONSULT.
also I SEWED THESE SURGERY GARBS AND THE BOOTIES MYSELF IN SILK
so IT WOULD BE SOFT AGAINST YOUR SKIN. HEH.
it's, UH-HEH-CHARMING.
it's HOW I EXPRESS MY FRIENDSHIP. HERE. IT'S MY HOBBY.
I MAKE TEDDIES INSTEAD OF KNITTING OR WHATEVER IT IS OTHER PEOPLE DO TO RELAX.
I'm IN A VERY STRESSFUL PROFESSION, AS I'M SURE YOU KNOW.
Colleen, WHEN WE STARTED WORKING TOGETHER,
I HAD IN MIND A MORE BUSINESSLIKE ARRANGEMENT.
I UNDERSTAND YOUR APPROACH IS A MORE PERSONAL,
hands-on KIND OF
you READY, SEAN? OPERATION KATRINA KIDS, HERE WE COME.
Oh, HEY, BOB. UH, YOU KNOW,
I'll BE RIGHT DOWN. WE'RE JUST FINISHING UP HERE.
operation KATRINA KIDS?
who's THIS?
CAA"? WHAT'S CAA?
that's C. A.A.CREATIVE ARTISTS AGENCY.
whatever. WHY ARE YOU GONNA FLY TO KATRINA WITH THEM?
what, YOU WANT POVERTY? I'LL SHOW YOU POVERTY. WE'LL GET IN MY VOLVO.
we'll DRIVE DOWN TO WATTS.
Oh, COME ON. THESE GUYS ARE GONNA EAT YOU ALIVE, SEAN.
you're NOTHIN' BUT A PIECE OF MEAT TO THEM,
and AS SOON AS THEY SWALLOW YOU,
they're GONNA SHIT YOU OUT JUST LIKE LAST NIGHT'S DINNER AT THE PALM.
um, BOB, CAN-CAN YOU JUST GIVE US A MINUTE?
Yeah.
do WHAT YOU GOTTA DO. WE GOT A PRIVATE JET WAITING.
no ONE'S GONNA LEAVE WITHOUT YOU.
OK.
nice TO MEET YOU, COLLETTE.
you CAN'T GO. YOU HAVE A PATIENT IN DISTRESS.
I TOLD YOU MY PATIENT HAS STABILIZED.
I'm ONLY OUT FOR THE AFTERNOON.
I WAS TALKING ABOUT ME.
my STAFF WILL LOOK AFTER YOU.
and AS FOR YOU AND ME, I HAVEN'T MADE ANY COMMITMENTS.
I JUST WANT TO EXPLORE MY OPTIONS.
fine. GO.
you JUST BROKE MY HEART.
go.
go!
tell ME WHAT YOU DON'T LIKE ABOUT YOURSELF.
tell ME WHAT YOU DON'T LIKE ABOUT YOURSELF.
tell ME WHAT YOU DON'T LIKE ABOUT YOURSELF.
big TURNOUT, HUH?
Yeah. I KNEW SHE DIDN'T HAVE ANY FAMILY,
but I DIDN'T REALIZE SHE HAD SO MANY FRIENDS.
nice TO KNOW, RIGHT,
that SHE TOUCHED SO MANY PEOPLE.
Hello, EVERYONE. I'M MANUEL.
Hi, MANUEL.
today's A VERY SAD DAY.
we've LOST A DEAR FRIEND,
a PILLAR OF SUPPORT IN OUR STRUGGLE TO CONTROL THOSE IMPULSES
that TOO OFTEN RUN OUR LIVES.
all THESE PEOPLE MUST BE FROM HER SEXAHOLICS ANONYMOUS HEYDAY.
Gina, MORE THAN ANYONE IN THIS ROOM,
you STRUGGLED WITH THOSE IMPULSES.
well, NO MORE.
so IN THAT SPIRIT, I'M GOING TO SAY WHAT I KNOW EVERYONE IS THINKING RIGHT NOW.
she GAVE THE BEST DAMN BLOW JOB I EVER HAD.
>> GINA, GAVE ME THE RIM JOB OF MY LIFE.
>> A HAND JOB LIKE AN OCTOPUS.
>> HER TONGUE COULD ACTUALLY VIBRATE.
>> IN FACT, I'M HARD RIGHT NOW.
>> MY LITTLE G SPOT.
that's WHAT I LIKED TO CALL HER.
>> AND THE TAINT IS REAL, FOLKS.
Gina TURNED ME ON TO THAT, TOO.
>> AND I AM GOING TO BE WHACKING OFF TO THOSE MEMORIES
for THE REST OF MY LIFE.
>> I ONLY HAD SEX WITH GINA ONCE
and I'M SORRY THAT I DID.
because I AM THE GUY
who GAVE HER AIDS.
not ON PURPOSE.
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW MYSELF THAT I WAS, UH
positive AT THE TIME.
but GINA
when I TOLD HER
she FORGAVE ME.
she, UH
she SAID IT WOULD FINALLY FORCE HER TO GET HER LIFE UNDER CONTROL,
something SHE WASN'T ABLE TO DO BEFORE.
she EVEN HELPED ME GET TREATMENT.
I MEAN
SHE-SUPPORTED ME.
this ADDICTION THAT WE HAVE
it CAN RUIN YOUR LIFE,
but IN A WEIRD WAY
when I MET GINA...
it SAVED MINE.
it WAS THE WAKE-UP CALL THAT I NEEDED,
and I WANNA THANK HER FOR THAT.
>> IS SOMETHING WRONG?
>> HE DID IT AGAIN, THIS TIME DURING SLEEPY TIME.
Mason PEARCE WAS JUST LYING ON HER MAT NEXT TO HIM.
she NEEDED 2 STITCHES.
>> WELL, I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
he's SUCH A SWEET KID.
>> WELL, HAVE YOU TOLD HIM ABOUT HIS MOTHER'S DEATH YET?
>> NO.
>> LOOK, I CAN'T PROTECT HIM ANYMORE.
if I DON'T REMOVE HIM, THE PARENTS ARE GOING TO SUE.
>> HOW MUCH?
wilber LOVES IT HERE.
he NEEDS SOME KIND OF CONSISTENCY IN HIS LIFE.
there MUST BE SOMETHING YOU NEED, A
a JUNGLE GYM?
>> I WAS HOPING THAT YOU COULD PROVIDE SOMETHING ELSE TO CLIMB ON.
that's IT. RIGHT THERE
big BOY. THAT'S GOOD. OHH. OH, WHAT A GOOD, BIG BOY YOU ARE.
Ohh. FASTER. OHH. YEAH, YEAH,
Yeah, YEAH. FASTER! FASTER! OHH
Oh, YES! THAT'S GOOD. OHH! YEAH!
faster, PLEASE! OHH!
>> JESUS! WHAT THE-YOU BIT ME.
>> OH, I'M SORRY.
>> YOU DREW BLOOD.
>> I'M SORRY. I JUST-UM, I'VE NEVER DONE THAT BEFORE.
I GUESS YOU BRING OUT THE ANIMAL IN ME.
>> YOU'RE THE ONE THAT BIT THE KIDS, AREN'T YOU?
>> I'M SORRY, BUT I WOULD NEVER HURT A CHILD.
I UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S DIFFICULT TO ACCEPT THAT
your SON HAS ISSUES
but IT'S GONNA TAKE A LOT MORE THAN
the ACCUSATIONS OF THE FATHER OF A BAD,
little BITER AND MY BEHAVIOR IN A MOMENT OF PASSION
to RELEASE WILBER FROM THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THESE ATTACKS.
OK?
>> OK.
well, I'M GONNA DO A HELL OF A LOT MORE THAN THAT, VAMPIRE.
just SO YOU KNOW, I'M PRETTY GOOD WITH SKIN,
and I DON'T THINK IT'D BE TOO MUCH TROUBLE FOR ME
to TAKE AN INDENTATION OF THE MARKS YOU JUST LEFT ON MY NECK
match THEM TO THE ONES ON THE KIDS
that YOU CLAIM WILBER BIT.
I HOPE YOU KNOW HOW TO OPERATE A GRIDDLE,
because YOU WON'T BE TEACHING KIDS ANYMORE.
>> THE NEW LAB WORK PINPOINTS HIS WHITE BLOOD COUNT AT 30, 000,
but THEY STILL DON'T PINPOINT THE CAUSE OF THE INFECTION.
>> WE'RE LOSIN' HIM, SEAN.
>> HOW IS HE?
>> WE NEED TO MOVE HIM, GET HIM TO A HOSPITAL.
he's FIGHTING SOMETHING, AND WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS.
we're RUNNING OUT OF OPTIONS.
>> I THINK I KNOW WHAT'S MADE HIM SICK.
I
I CUT MYSELF AND FED HIM SMALL PIECES OF MY-OF MY FLESH.
>> HE'S IN RECOVERY.
>> I DIDN'T MEAN TO. IT'S-AFTER THE OPERATION,
I FELT SO GUILTY ABOUT WHAT I DID,
about WHAT HE DID FOR ME.
I MADE HIM DO IT.
love NOURISHES. IT DOES.
>> WHAT?
>> KYLE SHOWED ME THAT.
>> DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW FILTHY AND CONTAMINATED HUMAN FLESH IS?
bacteria IN UNCOOKED MEAT CAN CAUSE LIFE-THREATENING DISEASES.
>> I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
I ATE PIECES OF HIM, AND I DIDN'T GET SICK.
>> WELL, YOU SAID HE WARMED THOSE PIECES.
obviously THE HEAT WAS ENOUGH TO KILL ANYTHING TOXIC.
if YOUR HUSBAND DIES, MRS. AINGE, YOU HAVE YOURSELF TO THANK.
>> WHO ARE YOU CALLING? I DIDN'T WANT TO HURT HIM.
I JUST- IT WOULD HELP ME GET RID OF MY SHAME.
I-I THOUGHT IF WE BOTH DID IT, WE COULD BE-BE LIKE WE WERE.
please DON'T CALL THE POLICE.
>> I CAN'T PROMISE YOU THAT. I'M SORRY.
Dr. LARSEN, PLEASE.
tell HIM DR. McNAMARA'S ON HIS WAY OVER.
if HE COULD MEET ME AT THE E. R. I'D APPRECIATE IT. UH-HUH.
>> WELCOME TO MY HUMBLE HOME.
>> WAIT A MINUTE. YOU SAID THIS WAS YOUR OFFICE.
>> MY HOME OFFICE, YES.
please, COME IN.
>> RIGHT.
so, KOREATOWN. IT'S AN UP-AND-COMING NEIGHBORHOOD, I'M TOLD.
>> I FEEL SO SAFE HERE, AND THE VEGETABLES ARE SO INEXPENSIVE.
Heh. CAN I TAKE YOUR JACKET?
>> YEAH.
Wow. LOT OF BEARS.
>> YES.
have YOU SPOKEN TO SEAN?
>> AH, HE'S RUNNING A FEW MINUTES LATE.
would YOU LIKE A GLASS OF ASTI? CHEESE CANAPE?
no? I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR AGREEING TO THIS MEETING, BOB.
I LIKE DOING THINGS IN A VERY OPEN AND HONEST FASHION,
just PUTTING EVERYTHING OUT ON THE TABLE.
that WAY, EVERYONE FEELS THAT THEY'VE BEEN HEARD
and SEAN CAN THEN MAKE A MORE INFORMED CHOICE.
whatever IT TAKES.
>> PLEASE.
wait!
>> YOU KNOW, UH, SEAN IS A GREAT TALENT.
he DESERVES THE BEST REPRESENTATION.
>> I MADE YOU YOUR OWN BEAR.
it's AN AGENT BEAR.
>> WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?
>> THAT'S WHAT YOU DO, ISN'T IT, EAT PEOPLE ALIVE?
devour THEIR SOULS AND SPIRITS?
have A CHEESE CANAPE, BOB.
>> NO.
>> I WENT TO A LOT OF TROUBLE.
>> THANK YOU. NO.
who ELSE DO YOU REPRESENT THESE DAYS?
Why? SO YOU CAN STEAL THEM FROM ME, TOO?
I REPRESENT MOON ZAPPA, DAKOTA FANNING.
I ALSO HAPPEN TO REPRESENT MS. NICOLE KIDMAN.
she's JUST STUNNING.
>> WELL, I WONDER HOW THAT WORKS,
since I'M ON TEAM NICOLE.
>> NOT ANYMORE!
>> WAKEY, WAKEY, MR. AGENT BEAR.
are YOU READY TO BE IMMORTALIZED FOREVER?
>> I KNOW WHAT YOU WERE THINKING.
you THOUGHT,"I'LL JUST MAKE A FEW SNIDE REMARKS
about HER AGE AND HER PITIFUL APARTMENT,
and THEN SEAN WILL BE ALL YOURS.
well, HARD TO TALK WITH DUCT TAPE ON YOUR MOUTH, ISN'T IT?
>> YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE...
>> TO BE A NOBODY
and SUDDENLY BECOME A SOMEBODY BECAUSE YOU HITCHED YOUR DUMB,
little UNIMPORTANT STAR TO ONE THAT SHINES SO MUCH BRIGHTER THAN YOURS?
and DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH IT HURTS
when THAT WONDROUS,
magical STAR SUDDENLY FLICKERS OUT
and DIES IN YOUR LIFE
and YOU END UP BEING JUST SHUT IN THE SHADOWS?!
>> IT HURTS SO MUCH!
you WILL NOT TAKE AWAY MY STAR!
you WILL NOT TAKE AWAY MY SEAN.
>> I WANT YOU TO OPEN YOUR MOUTH.
I SAID OPEN YOUR MOUTH!
get SOME GODDAMN DIGNITY.
>> SEE THE STUFFING?
it's GOING INSIDE YOU NOW.
>> THAT'S IT. THAT'S IT.
that's IT. THAT'S IT.
>> HEY, THERE. OFFICER KANE IS HERE TO ASSIST YOU TO THE POLICE STATION
and TAKE AN IMPRINT OF YOUR TEETH.
you COULD GO PEACEFULLY, BUT FRANKLY I'D PREFER IF YOU RESISTED ARREST.
>> I'LL BE HAPPY TO DO ANYTHING TO HELP CLEAR MY NAME.
our PARENTS PAY A PREMIUM TO SEND THEIR CHILDREN HERE,
and I REALLY DON'T WANNA WASTE ANY MORE OF MY VALUABLE TIME
so DR. TROY CAN REMAIN IN DENIAL ABOUT HIS SON.
>> JUST SO YOU KNOW, YOU'LL BE AWAY FOR 2 YEARS FOR THIS
and EVEN FEMALE INMATES DON'T TAKE KINDLY TO BITCHES THAT BITE BABIES.
>> I'M SORRY, OFFICER.
I FORGOT MY PURSE.
I HAD MY TEETH CAPPED, DICKHEAD.
OK. TCCH.
>> LANIE'S FOREARM FLEXOR MUSCLES ARE ABOUT 30% GONE.
she MIGHT LOSE PARTIAL CONTROL OF HER HAND BECAUSE OF THIS.
>> IF SHE HAD JUST ORDERED HIM BEEF CARPACCIO,
I DON'T THINK HER HUSBAND WOULD HAVE KNOWN THE DIFFERENCE.
>> HOW IS MR. AINGE DOING?
>> THE HOSPITAL LOCALIZED 2 INFECTIONS, TOXOPLASMOSIS AND LISTERIA,
but HE IS RESPONDING TO ANTIBIOTICS.
>> DID YOU TAKE A BITE OUT OF CRIME, McGRUFF?
>> THAT BITCH FILED AWAY THE EVIDENCE AND GOT CAPS,
so THEY COULDN'T PROSECUTE.
the PRINCIPAL BELIEVED ME,
however, SO THE LEAST I COULD DO IS GET HER FIRED.
>> WHAT ARE YOU GONNA TELL WILBER NOW THAT HIS TEACHER'S GONE, TOO?
>> THAT SHE WAS PICKED UP BY A TORNADO AND CARRIED FAR,
far AWAY AND NEVER TO BE SEEN OF AGAIN.
>> YOU CAN'T KEEP LYING TO HIM.
he's GONNA KEEP ASKIN' QUESTIONS. YOU KNOW THAT.
>> HE'S TOO YOUNG TO UNDERSTAND, ALL RIGHT?
it's TOO HARD ON HIM.
>> I THINK IT'S TOO HARD ON YOU.
>> IS THAT A SAUSAGE TOE?
>> I DON'T THINK SO. JUST A LITTLE SWOLLEN.
have YOU BEEN WEARING CLOSED-TOE SHOES?
>> OOPS. YOU TOLD ME, AND I FORGOT.
I WAS A BAD GIRL.
>> YOU JUST NEED TO ICE IT AND TAKE SOME IBUPROFEN.
>> SORRY I WAS SO PANICKY.
>> IT'S FINE.
you WILL REMAIN A WATCHED-OVER PATIENT AT McNAMARA/TROY
until YOU'RE HEALED AND HAPPY.
>> HEH.
um, I KNOW I KIND OF MISBEHAVED THE LAST TIME I SAW YOU,
and FOR THAT, I'M VERY SORRY.
and I ALSO WANTED TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY
to WISH YOU WELL WITH "CAW
and THAT CHARMING BOB LEVITZ.
actually, MY MENTOR TAUGHT ME ONCE,
she SAID, "NEVER BE SAD IF YOU LOSE A CLIENT.
it's SORT OF LIKE THE POPE.
you KNOW, ONE GOES, ANOTHER ONE COMES ALONG.
>> WELL, THIS POPE ISN'T GOING ANYWHERE.
apparently BOB LEVITZ HAD SOME KIND OF SPIRITUAL AWAKENING
after OUR TRIP TO NEW ORLEANS.
he SENT OUT A MASS E- MAIL VIA HIS BLACKBERRY
saying HE'S TAKIN' OFF FOR DARFUR TO BUILD SCHOOLS.
>> WHOA. HOW FANTASTIC FOR THOSE REFUGEES OVER THERE, HUH?
Bob's A REAL GO-GETTER.
I'm SORRY.
not SO FANTASTIC FOR YOU, SEAN.
>> HAVE ANY OF HIS COLLEAGUES TRIED TO CONTACT YOU?
>> OH, NOT A SINGLE ONE.
>> FOOLS. WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL ME?
I MEAN, AT THE VERY LEAST, I AM YOUR FRIEND.
>> I DIDN'T FEEL I HAD THE RIGHT
after RUNNING OFF LIKE THAT.
I GUESS I WAS BIT BY THE BUG
the HOLLYWOOD BUG.
>> HEH. THAT'S WHAT THIS TOWN DOES TO US.
Heh. WE'VE ALL BEEN THERE, COOKIE.
>> IT'S ODD. I NEVER WOULD'VE IMAGINED IT.
the WHOLE TIME WE WERE DOWN THERE,
he WAS CHASIN' FATS DOMINO, TRYIN' TO SIGN HIM.
>> DIDN'T SEEM LIKE HE HAD A SPIRITUAL AWAKENING.
>> HEH HEH. IT'S HARD TO KEEP THOSE ETHICS INTACTWHEN YOU HAVE THAT CONSTANT CORPORATE PRESSURE.
>> YEAH. I'M SEEING THAT.
>> WE WERE A RARE TEAM, YOU AND I.
what DO YOU SAY WE JUST FORGET THIS WHOLE INCIDENT AND
um, START OVER?
>> SOUNDS LIKE A PLAN.
>> GOOD.
>> CLOSE YOUR EYES. KEEP 'EM CLOSED. KEEP 'EM CLOSED.
keep 'EM CLOSED. NOT YET.
open 'EM. HEH.
>> HE'S MINE?
>> ACTUALLY, HE'S A SHE.
I CALLED HER LIPO. ISN'T THAT CUTE?
huh? DADDY GOT HER FROM THE POUND.
I ALWAYS WANTED A PUPPY WHEN I WAS A LITTLE BOY.
so NOW
any TIME YOU FEEL LIKE YOU MISS YOUR MOMMY,
you CAN PLAY WITH YOUR PUPPY SO YOU DON'T GET SAD.
>> COOL.
>> DADDY, IS MOMMY COMING BACK?
well, dr. rowe.
call me teddy.
stop worrying about how other people are react to you.
and do what you want to do.
you want the honest truth?
you'll never get her a national campaign, not with those thin villainous lips.
Dr. troy, plastic surgeon and breast cancer patient.
I know what it's like to look in the mirror and see my mutilated body.
but damn if i'm gonna accept it.
Liz thought you would change for her.
she informed me she's moving back to miami.
thank you.
is it really completely pitch black?
how are we going to know what we're eating.
you have to have a little blind faith, sean.
this whole experience is about opening up your other senses and letting go.
good evening. your name, please?
please, put your hand on the shoulder of the person in front of you and follow me.
Jesus, i can't see a thing.
that's the idea, jackass.
we didn't come to pasadena to eat at el pollo loco.
don't worry, mr. mcnamara.
I've done this a few times.
just keep your hand on my shoulder.
your waiter will be along shortly to present the amuse bouche and tell you about the menu.
enjoy your evening.
is he gone?
give me your hand.
the amuse bouche, mr. mcnamara.
somebody's not wearing any panties.
don't answer that.
it's julia. one of the kids might be sick.
Yeah, what's going on?
of course. my accountant sent it directly to the school.
hang up the phone, sean.
you can deal with this tomorrow.
just tell 'em if it doesn't post until monday, i'll call stan.
no, i sent annie's sweater last week.
Yeah. blue cardigan.
it was the only one in her top drawer.
fine. i'll check again. ok?
call you tomorrow.
sorry.
phone's off.
no more interruptions.
come on.
it could have been an emergency.
but it wasn't, was it?
OK.
I apologize. but it's over now.
let's go back inside.
no, sean.
until you stop taking responsibility for every little moment of everyone else's lives, i'm not interested. i can't just ignore my responsibilities.
a rolling stone gathers no moss.
and baby, you got a lot of moss.
sorry, i'm late.
Jesus, sean, you could have scheduled mr. tree man in a couple hours after i finished digesting my sushi.
he speaks perfect english, christian.
I'm used to such reactions, doctor.
one day, doctors at u. c.l. a.flew me from bali to los angeles to study my unique condition.
I caused a student nurse to faint and switch her career.
I've been looking like this since on my 18th birthday.
that's when i first scraped my foot.
I was swimming with a girl i had a crush on.
the first wart appeared shortly afterwards and began to spread uncontrollably.
doctors at u. c.l. a.gave him massive doses of vitamin a to retard the spread of the virus.
I'm guessing that didn't work.
Mr. sabri's condition was complicated by a rare immune system deficiency which enabled the virus to cause a massive proliferation of his cells, forming these cutaneous horns.
well, it's just a guess but u. c.l. a.is not paying for our buddy budi's little mani-pedi.
Mr. sabri, my partner and i don't want to mislead you.
it could take half a dozen procedures.
and even then we can't be certain how successful we'll be or what specifically we can accomplish.
you're saying that i should forget my dream as a fashion model.
when i was younger, the people in my village would gather their children inside when they saw me coming.
I was quite bitter about it.
now, if i could just walk on my own, lie down without pain.
to think that i could just find joy in my life.
or maybe one day feel human again.
so how did you get home last night?
call your mom?
I hitched a ride with our maitre d, actually.
don't you want to get a shot with mr. sabri for your photo album, teddy?
there is a big difference between mr. skerritt and this poor man.
he's a victim.
all he's known for years is pain and isolation.
whatever.
they'll be plenty of photo ops tomorrow at the press conference that i called.
Mr. sappy here should be well enough to smile at the camera and say cheese.
I know. i know.
I feel just as bad for this guy as you guys do. all right?
but i mean, come on, let's think about it here.
he's gonna clock up at least 60 billable hours.
how are we gonna get that back?
if you want attention, co-author the paper i'm gonna write forthe new england journal of medicine.
you know, i thought being sick yourself might open your eyes a little to what people like mr. sabri go through.
you know what, do me a favor, sean. don't lecture me on how i should deal with my cancer. ok?
I dealt with it my own way.
as far as i'm concerned, i think i did a pretty good job.
and i'm a much better person because of it.
anyway, i have my 12-week check up tomorrow with dr. moss.
so i'm looking to put this whole thing behind me.
Oh, jesus.
can you finish up for me?
Thanks.
come on.
give me another chance.
I'm not big on second chances.
if i wanted to be with a pussy, i'd be a lesbian.
well, i can loosen up.
I can be wild.
I had sex with a doll once.
I'll tell you all about it over lunch.
fine.
pick me up. my place. 1:00 sharp.
OK.
so you swear she's had no fever, no rashes, no swelling of any kind?
Oh, my god, christian, she's fine.
she's never been better.
except you can see the collagen's been absorbed.
and we're back to our thin, villainous lip problem.
you're gonna have to do it again.
when pigs fly sweetie pie.
I'm still having nightmares about what i did.
Yeah, but you see, the steves called.
and she's short listed for this new vintage inspired baby clothing line for target.
read my thin, villainous lips, ma rose.
it ain't never gonna happen.
we'll just go down the block to dr. potsander's office. he'll do it.
and i think we're gonna go to hermes to get a new little baby treat.
so we'll talk to you later.
you're not taking her anywhere.
let go of me! -hear me!
Hey, easy you two.
no fighting in front of the baby.
how's my girl?
let me see those lips.
I was just telling christian that the collagen he gave her has been absorbed.
so if he wants her career to stay on the fast track, she needs more of it.
first of all, mother of the year, i happen to know you did it.
Sean, you're such an easy lay in every possible way.
he did it.
I told him i'd take the blame to save his pretty face.
poor grandpa is just too embarrassed to admit that he wants his granddaughter to be a big star because he'll never be one.
if i find out you've injected anything into jenna again, i'll have you arrested for child endangerment.
damn straight.
am i clear?
I walked in. that crazy bitch is injecting jenna herself.
I only stepped in so there wouldn't be any complications.
look, i love her. i'm trying to do the best i can.
Oh, bullshit! you did this for you!
cause you wanted your granddaughter to get a modeling contract.
stop rationalizing.
and think about the reality of what you've done.
I thought you of all people
someone who was the victim of abuse-- would have known better!
how much further can you fall, christian?
wow, look at you.
how do you like my house?
I love it. it's amazing.
here's to a great day.
come on.
I want to show you the bedroom first.
this place is huge.
family money.
who's this?
my brother, his sister, and their daughter, wren.
I'm adopted.
well, i guess we can just order in.
or eat out.
strange. i didn't think i left the air conditioning on.
the house is listed at 4. 5
but i think i can can get them down to 3.
it's been on the market for almost a month already.
did you hear that?
no.
all the fixtures are original, painstakingly restored by the owners.
carra marble, brazilian rosewood throughout.
someone's breaking into your house.
I have a secret to tell you.
when was the restoration done?
um, 2005, i think.
I don't really have a korean brother. and this isn't really my house.
what do you mean it's not your house?
I thought it would be fun to break into an open house and have sex.
aren't you having fun?
you're gonna love the view from the bedroom.
you can see all of los angeles.
you can do one of 2 things.
you can either lose your shit and make a big scene or you can keep having fun.
it's up to you. but you better act fast.
Oh, my god!
who are you?
Hi.
are these sheets included in the asking price?
no. they are not.
and they're 800 threat count egyptian, so the kims better not find any jizzum stains when they return from big sur.
are you two interested in buying the house?
to be honest, it's a little above our price range.
well, we love it.
we-- we'll take it.
what are you gonna do, write us a check from jail?
would you take 20% down.
we're both doctors.
I'm sure we can arrange it.
doctors?
you know, there's a nice house in hancock park i know you'll love.
this one just went off the market.
come on.
m dr. troy, this is just a consultation.
never hurts to advertise.
would you look at that?
courtesy of mcnamara-troy.
extraordinary.
I'll be sure to recommend your practice.
good.
I'm just glad to have the whole goddamn ordeal over with.
I'll tell you one thing i know and that is chemo ain't for pussies.
I'd actually like to try you on a few courses of aromasin.
it's known to be effective in some of the more resistant cancers.
the tumor has spread to the supraclavicular lymph nodes.
the side effects are less dramatic with aromasin.
hot flashes. joint pain.
headache. fatigue.
and the results?
uncertain.
our recent trials indicate that it slows the progression.
it can also reduce the bone mineral density.
so there is greater likelihood of fractures.
in other words, i'll become so weak that my bones will break.
possibly...
in the final stages of the disease.
so, um...
give me a ballpark.
6 months.
with aromasin we might be able to give you a few more.
you know what? i think i'll
I appreciate everything you've done for me.
but i think i'll pass on another round.
I'm over my limit.
you have kids?
Yeah. yeah, i do.
good.
you won't have to go through this alone.
we get to do it in a tee pee?
Hey, sean, can i talk to you for a second?
you know what? i don't want to get into it.
you're a moral vacuum. nothing i sa nothing i do, nothing i wish for is gonna change that.
so where are you guys off to anyway?
the desert.
don't wait up.
did you see me?
I did. i saw you.
but you shouldn't be doing that.
your muscles are too atrophied.
hardly, dr. troy. i've been exercising them everyday in preparation for the day when i can walk to the tv and pick up the remote control.
the best part is...
let me take a look.
give me your hand.
let me ask you something.
with everything you've been through.
all the pain and the suffering and just everything.
you ever considered giving up?
I don't have anything to give up.
no, i mean, suicide.
taking your own life.
no.
not possible.
since i believe as a hindu that even I in this inhuman body am a true expression of god.
you understand? -i understand.
I'm a firm believer that...
I'm very much on my own in this life.
do you pray, dr. troy?
not anymore.
you should.
it works.
you see, my prayers brought me to you.
and in turn it brings me closer to my real dream in my life.
and what's that?
to find a woman.
she doesn't have to be a beautiful woman, just a woman who would consider holding me, perhaps enjoy my jokes.
another soul that would accept me warts and all.
I am a shaman. welcome.
we fasted like you asked.
good.
have you ever experienced ayahuasca before?
I dropped acid a few times in college.
ayahuasca is much stronger.
you're both about to go much deeper than you ever have before.
what do you mean deeper?
it is possible under the power of the tea to cleanse yourself of all anxieties and depressions.
you can even find a greater spirituality.
but there is a price.
the incas call it the vine of the dead for a reason.
the nausea will be extreme.
you will want to die.
but you must have strong courage and discipline.
and if you are lucky, you may experience what is called the murdering of the ego.
actually, i think i'd like to try that.
you are petrified dr. mcnamara.
untouchable like me.
not human.
I can't move!
that is your curse.
this is fantastic.
are you happy now?
are you happy now?
are you happy now?
no history of heart disease.
no diabetes, hypertension.
last week his wife fell off a ladder in her garden and died.
2 days later he has a massive infarction.
a broken heart.
romantic.
so, how's miami treating you?
it's good to be back.
I haven't found a place yet.
I'm thinking i want to get a condo by the beach.
I sleep a lot better when i hear the sound of the ocean.
you know, i hope it's not out of line, liz, i have this really terrific friend, just moved in from out of town.
any interest in being set up?
man or woman?
uh, sorry, i just assumed-- aren't you gay?
she is with everybody else except for me.
I am sorry. you cannot be in here.
I'm a doctor, sweetheart. i know the sterile zone.
OK, i am so sorry. i am so sorry.
this is dr. christian troy.
he's my old boss.
and what are you doing here?
uh, you know, i've been on a plane or in an airport for 8 hours.
I need to talk to you face to face.
I'm not coming back, christian.
I'm a bad person, lizzie. i know that.
that is not what i am saying.
no, it's what i'm saying.
look, i know i don't have much of a conscience.
I don't know what happened. either i was born without it or it just kinda rotted away like some gangrenous appendage or something.
and i know i get down on you about all your speeches and stuff.
I just-- i...
I want you to be the voice in my head that tells me right from wrong.
I
I wish you'd come home with me, lizzie.
I need you.
we have been down this road before, christian.
what's in it for me?
I want you to marry me.
m lose the rock.
it's getting in the way of the laryngoscope.
come on. wish me luck.
it's a whole new journey for me now.
good luck.
like throwing confetti at the hindenburg.
I'm not gonna hurt her, sean.
right.
she finally pulls herself together in miami.
and you lure her back to what?
re-break her heart?
nice.
what about teddy? what are we supposed to do with her?
just toss her out?
well, if her dedication to her job is any indication, yeah.
I mean, where the hell is she?
Teddy's sick.
we ate something bad.
it was probably the oysters.
I was up all night myself.
you look a little green around the gills there buddy boy.
can't you just be happy for me?
Liz is the only woman i've ever been with who forces me to stop being a dick.
she doesn't do it by judging me.
she does it by loving me.
I don't want to go to my grave knowing that everybody thinks i'm some kind of soulless, inhumane asshole.
look, i'm not some kind of moral paragon, ok.
and you're not about to die.
you're getting married.
don't confuse the 2 like the rest of us.
Linda is going to be the maid of honor.
I guess that means we'll be getting married on a golf course?
congratulations, liz.
I'm very happy for you.
I can tell.
15 blade.
uh, sean...
excuse me.
I'm not feeling very well.
Christian, listen to me, we have to talk.
sweetheart, i'll do anything you ask.
just don't make me get married in a church.
I think that teddy is stealing drugs from the office.
a ton of inventory is missing and i mean a ton.
and i don't know who else could have done it.
Teddy is not a druggy, trust me.
I can smell a druggy a mile away.
just take a look at these pictures from bali, ok.
this resort is fantastic for a honeymoon. come on, take a look.
Christian, we are legally obligated to report this to the authorities.
now, i don't know teddy at all.
but we have to bring sean into this.
this is serious-- -can you give it a rest, lizzie, please.
I stole the drugs.
what?
I stole them.
and may i ask you why?
I was contemplating suicide. then i changed my mind.
and asked you to marry me instead.
you are not a suicidal person.
well...
your cancer came back.
how bad?
um, 6 months to a year.
is that why you proposed to me?
I thought about taking charge of my death by using those pills.
but then i realized that i wanted to take charge of my life.
and i want to spend the rest of my life with you
you and wilbur.
when were you going to tell me what my first year of marriage was going to be like?
Oh, well maybe you weren't.
maybe you were just going to act like you were devastated and surprised when you started to go to shit.
I guess i just wanted to enjoy the sweetness of getting married.
you know, at least for a little while.
you wanted to marry me so that i would help you die.
you know what, you can just go to hell!
Yeah, i got your message.
I'm at the office right now.
where are you?
what's this?
I haven't seen you for 3 days.
where you been?
I heard your old anesthesiologist came back.
I figured you didn't need me here anymore.
you ever done it on a surgical table?
I don't think this is the time, teddy.
you know my motto, sean.
no time like the present.
you ever screwed on nitrous?
it's dangerous.
not when done on moderation.
and you will have the most intense orgasm you have ever experienced.
you can trust me.
I'm an anesthesiologist.
you want this place to go up in flames?
and there he is.
our sean.
so careful and methodical.
and safe.
and boring?
look, i spent my morning having a flashback that interfered with a surgery.
I spent my afternoon on the phone with a very pissed off realtor who only calmed down after i made a very large contribution to his favorite charity.
Teddy, you're going too far.
you are such a buzz kill.
no. i'm a surgeon.
it's in my d. n.a. to be careful and methodical and safe.
the very nature that you detest is what keeps people alive on my table.
I tried.
but i can't change who i am.
frankly, i don't want to have to apologize for it anymore.
I am so sorry.
for what?
cause this isn't gonna work out.
ain't gonna find it out there buddy boy.
find what?
something to say.
come on. sit down.
my best friend just told me that he's-- -dying.
you got to say it.
I actually have to say the word.
it's very important.
it just gets a lot worse if you don't. trust me.
look, i'm the one who's got a $150, 000 wedding ring. jesus.
you'll get your money back.
Oh, i don't care about the money.
it's lizzie.
you're right what you said.
I dragged her all the way here from miami and broke her heart again.
she'll understand...
given...
I didn't mean all those things i said.
I didn't know what you were going through.
do you really think you should be smoking a cigar given what your body is trying to fight right now?
this is not a cigar my friend.
this is pre-embargo, hand rolled, cuban tobacco.
this is an artifact.
it's been sitting in a humidor in miami for over 40 years.
I bought 2 of them for a special occasion, like my wedding.
but under the circumstances, i think now's as good a time as any, don't you?
look, there are plenty of experimental treatments and clinical trials we can get you signed up for.
there's the angiostatic approach.
they use anaerobic bacteria to attack the tumor.
cancer treatment's not what it was when we were in school.
have a drink buddy boy. you need one.
were you listening to me?
you can beat this thing.
you can get married again someday. you don't know.
you don't think i've thought about all that shit, sean?
I mean, seriously.
I don't want to spend the last few months of my life in hospitals.
I just want-- i want to celebrate every day.
I want to get all my shit together and i want to
I want to enjoy myself.
will you sit with me?
you got to try one of these.
they're incredible.
you didn't need to get married to make sure you wouldn't be alone.
why'd you want to bring me back here, sean?
so we can finish what we started.
so even though it's dark, you can see i'm willing to meet you half way.
you aren't wearing underpants.
you dirty boy.
good evening. my name is jacqueline.
I'll be your waitress.
the amuse bouche this evening is
you know what, jacqueline, we're going to pass on the amuse bouche.
and actually we want to be left alone for a while and get used to the darkness.
there's 200 bucks in it for you if we don't hear you for 30 minutes.
as you wish, mr. mcnamara.
get used to the darkness?
I like that.
and you'll like this, too.
I'm glad to see you taking taking it easy mr. sabri.
no more long distance treks across the room.
let's take a look.
good.
little thickening of the skin. but so good so far.
you know, once we're finished with these skin grafts, we'll have to talk about dancing lessons.
you do a lot of dancing where you're from?
when i woke up this morning, i noticed them.
they multiplied as the day went on.
I had such hope.
me, too.
have you seen my non-fat blueberry?
I'm eating it.
we're gonna have to start labeling things.
does that mean you're staying?
I'm not going to have a long distance marriage.
so why the change of heart?
well, i figure i'm gonna have to take care of your sorry ass anyways.
so i might as well get a big honking diamond ring out of it, right?
I mean, there's not one lesbian i know who could afford one that big.
you don't have to do this.
I know.
but you know like they say, for better or for worse.
I know you better than you know yourself, christian.
and i'm not gonna let you die alone.
look at it this way.
I'll be dead before we can get divorced.
we have a meeting with a wedding planner tomorrow at 9: 00.
don't you be late.
nice ass.
and it's all yours.
Dr. Christian Troy.
Dr. Mike Hamoui.
Mcnamara-Troy, right? - You've heard of us, eh?
Hey, I heard you guys were out here now, too.
I have to tell you I've always been a big fan of your work.
hope to see you soon, Kimber.
nice to meet you, Mike.
for Christ's sake, snap yourself out of it, would you?
as if Mike'd date an old leather shoe like you.
whatever, Christian.
mime is so amazing, man.
it takes us behind our petty egos, beyond language, and-- and unifies us.
is this a joke?
we can rent your room, ok?
so you either kick in, or you're out by the first.
OK.
here.
Sean Mcnamara, will you marry me?
Yes, I will.
do you have any idea what kind of stress he's been under?
do you?
that's why he's living the lifestyles of the rich and famous with you and trying to pay child support and trying to keep the business from going under.
he's hanging on by a thread.
what happened to the girl that didn't give a shit about all these conventional, bourgeois trappings?
I think we should just take a giant step back.
what, you're gonna break off our engagement over this?
I wish you knew me better, Sean.
things mean nothing to me.
honesty, that means everything.
tell us what you don't like about yourself, Briggitte, because I'm having trouble finding any flaws.
Oh, you're so very sweet.
where are your people from?
uh, my mother's Mexican, and my father's from Egypt.
Oh. - I was actually raised in Cairo.
and not even a hint of an accent.
I disguise it well.
get a couple Heinekens in me, and, oh, forget about it.
what is it you want done, Mrs. Reinholt?
according to your file, you have, uh, every plastic surgery procedure known to man in very interesting locales
venezuela, Lisbon, Singapore.
I travel.
some people collect snow globes.
I like face-lifts.
but in the last 6 months, the only thing I've had done was a little lunchtime lipo in Vegas.
I am not an addict.
and let me apologize if Dr. Troy implied that you were.
excuse me?
well, before you pucker up and kiss my ass too much, pretty boy, first you got to lipo out all the fat in there from the last few months, eh?
also, I want my, uh, neck tightened, and then I think I want another little, uh, brow lift.
but I must have my own man in there to supervise the postop.
madam, we provide state-of-the-art postop care.
there's really no need for an outside physician.
Yeah, but Hans is not a doctor.
he's a leech farmer.
leeches? - Oh, yes.
Dr. Mendoza used it down in Caracas after my last eye lift.
I swear it heals 3 times faster than usual.
see, those leeches-- - I know what the leeches do.
their saliva acts as an anticoagulant and an anti-inflammatory.
Yes, and then you give yourself a little tiny dose of heparin and a couple of aspirin, and, mwah, oh, they're little miracle workers.
they're a crock, and I'm not gonna allow them in this office.
the last thing we need here is more parasites.
what are you so afraid of, Christian?
you know what, boys? I think I'll have Hans come in and show you his babies.
and why would I agree to that?
because, darling, I pay in cash.
don't you ever talk to me like that again.
this is my office, pod boy.
you're right.
I'm sorry.
look, I need to be honest with you.
I've been hiding these feelings, and now I'm acting out.
it's Kimber.
she's still in love with you.
when I eat asparagus, my piss stinks. Tell me something I don't know.
I'm in love with her.
what?
you're seeing Kimber?
Oh, it's been the most amazing 6 weeks of my life.
I've been with thousands of chicks, but there's something about Kimber that just hooks me. She's so open, you know?
Ohh. First couple weeks.
we were doing it 3 times a day, all over town, and oof. All of sudden, ffft. Nothing.
total lockdown.
maybe you just don't turn her on any more.
hate to say it, but, uh
fact is I didn't wanna have to, but looks like you got a little more junk in the trunk, my friend.
well, I've been eating a lot more, you know.
Yeah.
stress.
the last time we did it, she even started crying.
she ever do that with you?
what, you think this is because she's in love with me?
she talks about you.
a lot.- Yeah? What's she say?
nothing good.
but it's more about the quantity than quality.
she can't disguise how she's really feeling.
tell you what I'll do.
I'll get to the bottom of what's going on.
Kimber's never been able to lie to me.
Really? - Yeah.
you'd do that for me?
you get yourself back into shape, and I'll make sure that Kimber's all lubed up and ready to go.
ho ho. Thanks, man. You're the best.
OK, come on. We're at work.
Oh, it's not like anyone can do anything now.
you don't want them to find out that way, do you?
guess I do wanna see the looks on their faces.
could I get everyone's attention for a second, please?
Teddy and I have an announcement to make.
we eloped 2 days ago.
surprise.
you got married?
Yep, and we have the hardware to prove it. - Yes, we do.
is this a joke?
why would it be a joke?
you dumped her and fired her a few days ago.
we couldn't stand being apart, so we decided to have one of those "let's try and be friends" dinners.
and one thing led to another. - Yep.
anyway, we figured the best way to get through these stormy patches was - to drop anchor and just make a firm commitment. - Go down with the ship.
what I think he meant to say was congratulations.
we're very happy for you, and we are just a little bit surprised.
so what are you two doing here?
you should be on your honeymoon.
well, Annie comes in this week, so I thought it'd be better if she met Teddy right away, not postpone anything, you know?
you're not gonna congratulate us?
of course. Congratulations.
Hans! Sorry. I'm a little distracted.
we're right in the middle of a lesson here.
what's this?
this is Ms. Reinholt's Argentinean genius, who's gonna teach us how these little suckers work.
Hans, this is my newly married partner, Sean Mcnamara.
Congratulations.
could you put one of those on Christian, maybe around his mouth?
Oh, just like the old Liz, the one I didn't marry.
so, as I was saying, hirudotherapy, or using leeches for medicinal purposes, has been around for thousands of years.
Why?
well, they have a natural anticoagulant they secrete.
it's great for postsurgical use, because they restore the blood flow around the sutures.
Yeah, well, I'm still not touching them.
how much blood can they drink?
up to 5 times their weight.
now, they do run a high risk of infection, don't they?
no more than any other recovery method, and they work much faster than manmade drugs.
and Mrs. Reinholt has used them before, and she gave us a deposit, so if she wants leeches, she gets leeches.
uh, it's feeding time for my little friends.
I put their food in your fridge, so, uh, excuse me.
you know, Mrs. Mcnamara,
I wanna hear every single detail about that wedding.
let's go, Linda.
I get it.
you're pissed I didn't tell you.
still doesn't excuse the attitude.
actually I'm not pissed at all.
I've had my fair share of weddings this year, and I'm fine with it.
well, then what? Just spit it out.
you don't like her? I don't care.
I just hope you didn't put any of your stuff in her name.
Teddy's not Liz, Christian, and I'm not you.
and as far as signing my life over, she's the one who insisted I sign a prenup before we got married.
that's right.
maybe it's better you weren't there.
make sure "she can't touch your money" would have been a lousy toast.
fancy meeting you here. - Jesus, Christian.
you scared me.
what are you doing here?
last I heard, this is a public beach.
leave me alone.
I got a vested interest, sweetie pie.
you're banging one of my staff.
how's that going, by the way?
I hear there's a little trouble in paradise.
why won't you sleep with him, huh?
cause he's a knockoff of the real thing?
he is a sunny, upbeat person, and you aren't.
what's the matter then?
he can't keep his cum in his cock long enough for you to get off?
no.
in fact, he has a few moves that would make you blush.
the problem is that he's perfect.
and just when I'm ready to let go,
I think of you, and then a little voice pops in my head saying, "is he gonna ask you to pee on him, or is he gonna put you in handcuffs, or is he gonna hand you a dildo?
and I'm tired of it. I want a connection, like a real emotional connection.
and every man turns into a complete asshole the minute you open up to him, so I keep him sweet,
I keep him vulnerable by not putting out so much.
well, you know what they say. There's no prude like an old whore.
what the hell is that?
well, we got drunk on our second date and exchanged tattoos.
he has me on his shoulder.
it's cute, huh?
you 2 mental midgets belong together.
you know, if I didn't know better,
I'd think you were jealous.
honey, eat.
you love pasta.
you're a pasta-tarian.
you used to beg me to take you to a place like this when we were in Florida.
can you turn off your Ipod, please?
I said take off your Ipod, please.
stop it. You'll break them.
and take off that hat. - I don't want to.
Annie, your mom told me you were having a tough time adjusting to the divorce and all the changes, and I want you to know
I get it, and I'm here for you.
we both are.
you're the one who married her, not me.
all right, you know what? I don't care how much you're going through.
I didn't raise you to be rude.
it's fine, Sean. Just leave it.
OK. Great.
let's just eat. - I'm not hungry.
my stomach hurts.
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
unless you think that would be rude.
I'm sorry.
it's like I don't even recognize her.
I don't know who that is.
that is a 13-year-old girl, honey.
we're all horrifically hormonal at that age. It's totally normal.
and what's with the makeup and the hat?
well, I guess she's just, you know, experimenting for the first time, trying on different personas, disguises, seeing what image fits her.
well, they're gonna have to fit me with a straitjacket.
I tell you, compared to her, Matt was a breeze.
well, I am sorry, but I have to leave you, too.
Oh. Right. Run away.
coward.
lawyer appointment actually.
if something happens to me,
I want everything to go to my new husband.
good luck. - Yeah. I'm gonna need it.
are you Swedish? Is that it? Is that what-- Yeah. You are?
Yeah. What's your last name?
Klein. Well, have you had any surgeries done yet?
which ones?
good afternoon, Mrs. Reinholt.
I'm Dr. Mcnamara.
I'll be doing your operation.
Oh, I don't care who does my surgery, darling.
just tell me, did my leeches make it here all right?
Ah, the little suckers are sliming away happily in the next room, awaiting marching orders.
Ah, good, good, good, 'cause I have a very big charity event this weekend, and the only way I can make sure that I recover in time is if I have the hirudotherapy and then a little bit of the soupcon of the heparin on the side.
now, heparin is contraindicative with leeches, because they produce their own anticoagulant.
you can't rush recovery, Mrs. Reinholt.
Oh, but I always do, doctor. I always do.
OK. Shall we get started?
let's put this show on the road.
Linda, hit it.
Dixie, is that you?
Oh, you look fantastic as a brunette.
no, I'm Teddy, Teddy Rowe.
Oh, come on. I never forget a pretty face.
Oh, sweetie, I'm so sorry about what happened with Harland.
Oh, you poor baby. Oh, you poor child.
what is she talking about?
I don't know. She must have thought I was someone else.
hey there, stranger.
you must be pretty hungry. I saved some food for you if you
I told you my tummy hurts.
well, if you get hungry in the middle of the night, it's in the fridge, and you can just help yourself, ok?
no, don't. I like to wear it. It helps me fall asleep.
Annie, you have to take it off.
it's not healthy to keep a hat on all the time.
you gotta give your scalp a chance to breathe.
Hey, when was the last time you washed your hair, huh?
want all the boys to run in the opposite direction and say you have stinky hair?
sweetie, I'm not fooling around.
I just wanna-- - Dad, no.
I just want you to take-- - Dad!
I want it off.
what the hell is this?
how did this happen?
Annie, how did this happen?
I get nervous sometimes. I just--I just pull it out. That's all.
does your mother know about this?
no, and if you tell her, I'll never speak to you again.
did you know that Hippocrates used leeches?
so did ancient Indian doctors and the Egyptians.
they also prayed to the hippo gods in hope that springtime would come.
what's in the box?
wedding presents.
are all these for me?
Oh, no, no, no. You get to pick one.
Well..."to Liz and Christian, get toasted, love nurse Linda."
I'm guessing that's the toaster oven.
are you regifting your wedding presents?
try the big box. It could be an ice-cream maker.
Thanks.
it's just what I wanted.
Mike was looking for you.
you know he's dating Kimber?
what a skank.
what do you care?
I don't care.
she's a whore, has absolutely no moral values.
sound like anyone else you know?
come on.
you and Kimber were made for each other. We all know it.
you're both superficial, addicted to sex.
both of you were abused as children.
bullshit. I can do better than her.
for a night, maybe.
Kimber is the only woman who would actually stay with you.
you are the male and female version of the same person.
frankly, I'm surprised it's taken you this long to figure that out.
come on. We have a consult.
OK.
tell us what you don't like about yourself, Mr. O'Brien.
uh, call me Steve.
I'm not a pretty woman.
well, Steve, men are doing cosmetic surgeries in almost equal measure with women.
what I mean is an attractive female face would be slightly heart-shaped.
her profile would be fairly flat, her features more delicate in appearance.
I mean, if you look at my profile, it slopes backwards.
you a transsexual?
a transvestite.
a fully functioning heterosexual male who occasionally likes being a woman.
my feminine name is modesty.
I'm not gay, and most transvestites aren't.
we just have certain characteristics inside of us that society labels feminine.
cross-dressing provides me the opportunity to explore certain things that I suppressed as a kid.
I see that you're married.
Oh. Yeah. 17 years.
3 great kids.
my wife said she married me 'cause I was like a great girlfriend.With a fully functioning penis.
you know, looking at you, I'm not sure a brow reduction or a chin reduction would create a more feminine profile.
I think it would just compromise what you already have.
that's my point, doc.
uh, I wanna stay a good-looking man.
I just wanna broaden my options as a woman.
that's why I'm here.
I want you to create a mask that I could actually wear in public.
but why?
your wife likes you the way you are.
I don't know if you guys are married, but my wife likes going out, and unless we stick to gay restaurants or visits to Buckles and Boas, we run the risk of running into somebody from the office or, god forbid, the tennis club. I mean, those guys are mostly lawyers.
they live inside the box. They wouldn't understand modesty.
what's, uh, Buckles and Boas?
uh, it's a boutique that caters to transvestites.
they make female underwear that takes care of our needs.
uh, just have a look at my specs.
you know, I'm sure you can improve on what I've done.
uh, we do plastic surgery, not special effects.
you do faces.
guys, I'm just asking you to dress me up for the ball so I can turn back into plain old Steve at the stroke of midnight.
I'm willing to pay top dollar.
the, um, Buckles and Boas, that, uh, in west Hollywood?
uh, yeah.
cool.
research...
stuff.
Oh, there you are.
so, did you talk to Kimber yet?
bad news, Kemosabe.
it's over, isn't it?
shit.
I was thinking she was the one, you know?
she still could be.
you just have to show her that you're willing to go the distance, my friend.
what do you mean?
well, Kimber's a porn star.
she's done it every which way and then some, right?
oral, anal, double penetration, triple team--everything.
you think she cares about some regular joe cock guy?
jeez, Christian, what'd you do when you two were together?
well, you know, I was banging her before her pussy became a revolving door, but there's one thing that got her off, when I dressed up like a woman.
that shit, she loves it, the kinkier, the better.
you're crazy. No way. I can't do that.
come on. If you love her, that's the only way you can prove how.
Wh--I wouldn't even know where to start.
I mean, what am I supposed to do, just walk into a Bloomingdale's and ask for a
heels and dress in my size?
better yet, go to a place that caters to your needs.
you really suck. You know that?
I was just trying to make you laugh, you know, enjoy life a little bit.
just go. I don't feel good.
fine. Stay in your little box of brattices.
I tried, man. She's being a complete bitch.
don't call your sister a bitch.
she's obviously going through a very hard time.
as long as she knows you care, maybe just try to respect her space a little.
Yeah, well, she can have all the space she wants.
all right, I'm outta here.
wait a minute. I'm making lunch for everyone.
uh, I'm not hungry.
Matt, we haven't all been together as a family in a long time.
I think this is what she needs. I think we all need it. I need it.
please. Just try.
fine. Ok. - Thank you.
Annie, lunch is ready.
dad!
dad, please!
owl! It hurts!
daddy, my stomach!
it hurts so much.
all right. Let me see. Let me see.
she was fine a minute ago.
what, do you think it could be her appendix?
I don't think she has an infection.
honey, did you eat something that I don't know about?
all right, get my car keys.
we gotta take her to the hospital.
come on, sweetie.
what about the pain? Should we do a biopsy?
I don't think a biopsy will be necessary.
your daughter has something called trichobezoar, or the more colloquial rapunzel syndrome.
it's an intestinal condition, extremely rare, resulting from the consumption of hair.
what?
it's usually triggered by trichotillomania, a nervous disorder in which one pulls out one's own hair.
you can see the mass that's collected here in the gastrointestinal tract, which is what's causing the stomach pain.
well, is there a purgative to give her to induce
I'm afraid with a hairball this size, surgery will be necessary to remove it.
endoscopic retrieval.
with your consent, we can have her scheduled for tomorrow evening.
no, that won't be necessary, thank you.
it's my fault.
I just, uh-- I left her.
I figured she'd be able to process the divorce, like half the kids she knows had.
and suddenly she's got a new mom, and she's never met her.
Sean, you're doing the best you can, and nobody's perfect.
have you called Julia?
well, I downplayed what's going on with Annie.
Julia's been very fragile lately.
didn't wanna upset her.
she's coming out next week.
I should have known better.
even though she doesn't live with me, she still needs my protection.
would you get in here?
stop acting so suspicious.
you're just drawing attention to yourself.
all right? Just relax. - All right.
just take a breath.
just be yourself. I mean, that's what this place is all about.
look at that. Oh, my god. This place is fantastic.
ahh, I don't know if I can go through with this, Christian.
Aw, you love her, right? Huh?
you wanna satisfy her, so this is what works, ok?
well, then you're gonna have to help me then, all right?
cause you know her best.
Hey, sweetheart.
you, uh, got a bag we can use while we're shopping?
just, uh, let me know if you need a room.
Thanks.
follow me.
Mike, how's it going in there?
OK, I guess.
see the Lakers last night?
are you kidding?
I used to play in college.
Seriously?
Oh, yeah.
think they'll go the whole way?
Oh, definitely.
I mean, we can run the floor, post up.
and they got that deep bench.
it's on - Hey, Christian, you wanna come in and see?
Oh, just come out. What's the big deal?
well, I don't know if I'm too comfortable with that right now.
you know, if you can't do it here, then, you know, how are you gonna be able to do it later?
just step out and show us what you're working with.
remember, I'm here to help you.
OK.
what do you think?
I think she'll love it.
Oh, yeah.
just give me more and more and more of my little friends, ok, Hans.
I got a packed social schedule.
I really need for the swelling to be down by Saturday.
Ohh. I'm gonna hurl.
Hey, where's Dixie?
I'm sorry?
Dixie, my little, uh, friend from Las Vegas.
Oh, she was so helpful with that, uh, business with the morphine drip. Ooh.
I could use a little more morphine right now, huh?
you mean Teddy?
her name is Dixie, goddamn it.
why does everybody keep talking to me like I'm senile?
Oh, come on, Hans. Give me some more leeches.
every little suck makes me feel one step closer to perfection, darling.
I'm just gonna put one more.
no, sweetie, more than one. Come on.
no, more than one.
I'm telling you, more than one.
you already have 4.
Oh, for goodness sake.
nurse, could I please have some water? My throat.
I can't move my hands.
what's--what's going on here, huh?
I need you to stay still, Mrs. Reinholt, - until these suckers do their work. - Oh, my god.
no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no.
what is this?!
Oh, god. - Now, now.
why are you doing this?
stay calm.
somebody, help!
please-- I'm gonna have to help you relax.
Oh, god.
Hello!
Hello! Stop!
no, no, no, no.
beauty sleep.
your little suckers are so beautiful.
you're bleeding out.
I'm so sorry.
we're all out of band-aids.
cause of death-- exsanguination due to misapplication of medicinal leeches.
I don't remember there being so many.
I only put 6 leeches.
she must have added some herself to speed up the recovery process.
woman was painphobic. She was mad as a hatter.
you don't understand. They're totally engorged.
they're supposed to fall off once they're full.
I want a full toxicology report.
heparin?
you guys didn't give her blood thinner, did you?
of course not.
no wonder the leeches kept feeding.
she must have self-administered.
she mentioned using heparin in Venezuela.
she could have used that to inject it into her I. V.
I mean, no disrespect to the dead, but, uh, she was bat-shit.
things people do to be beautiful.
Hey, close the doors, dude.
you were totally right.
Kimber went crazy.
she liked the kinky tranny look?
totally.
OK. So what'd you wanna show me?
she liked it?
you like it?
I--I wanted you to, you know, see that
I was in touch with my feminine side.
of course I like it.
I love it.
I don't believe you.
I'm telling you, I got the blow job of my life last night.
Oh, I owe you so much, man. Thank you.
I never would have done it if it weren't for you.
what's this?
Oh, I went crazy and ordered a whole bunch more stuff at crossdresser. Bras, corsets, panties, uh, strap-on latex boobs.
you're really committed to this, Mike.
Hey, Kimber's into it, I'm into it, right?
so, um, did she tell you how good I looked when I'm dressed up, you know, like a chick?
christian never did this for you, did he, dress up like a ladyboy to excite you?
no. Never.
I mean, that idea would never have raced through that self-centered little brain of his.
he would never risk making a fool out of himself to make me happy.
Nope.
we were so busy getting busy, we never even talked about you, bro.
your consult's waiting for you in the lobby, Mike.
thank you, Linda.
Hey, go ahead and check out all the stuff.
just don't take it home, cause I'm planning on wearing all of it tonight.
I thought you were supposed to get your blood drawn before we got married.
what's all this?
well, all your talk about wills and insurance inspired me.
I am doubling my life insurance policy.
are you planning on, uh, dying anytime soon, Dr. Mcnamara?
no, but I'm not gonna live forever.
our slump at work is going to end, but what if something happens to me during the next one?
I have worked too hard to leave my family with nothing.
listen, I hope you understand.
uh, I'm making Conor and Annie sole beneficiaries.
what about Matt?
I gave him a large sum of money from the sale of the Florida house, and he spent it on scientology, his porn star wife, and methamphetamines.
so no fatted calf for the prodigal son.
not unless he kills it himself.
how about a drink?
uh, just a few more signatures, Dr. Mcnamara.
I'll get it.
it's perfect.
I'm so happy for you, honey.
I'm so happy for us, for the freedom this gives us to live out our fantasies.
look at me.
I'm pretty like a vain schoolgirl.
we better hurry.
our dinner reservation's in half an hour.
what do you think, Dr. Cruz?
is my shadow balanced?
you're asking the wrong person.
Hey, I've got an idea.
what if Annie stayed with us for a couple of months?
you know, with all the trouble she's been having, it might be nice to, uh, give her some time with her dad.
she's on a break from school, right?
heck, Conor can come out, too.
Really?
you wouldn't mind having a couple of rug rats running around?
Sean, those kids are my new family. I'm their stepmom.
this'd be a great way to get to know each other, and I can make my new husband happy.
well, it might put a crimp in our honeymoon period.
Annie is not well enough to fly yet.
she needs time to recover, you know, get her strength back up.
Julia can always come out later if she wants.
I'm completely comfortable with that.
I love you.
uh, Dr. Mcnamara.
a few more.
what about if I gave you a ring?
it came from mike's heart,
and I don't think you really Have one.
I do have one, And it belongs to you. It always has.
turn around, walk with your Back towards us.
your son's doing just fine. He sends his love.
where is matt? I want to see matt.
don't worry, I'm taking Good care of him.
you gotta help me! Please!
tell me what you don't like About yourself, mrs. uh...
special agent thomas. I'm from the district attorney's Office.
so what can we do for you?
I want you to suck the fat Out of a murdering piece of scum
so we can kill him.
Wesley clovis.
he's due to be executed In 2 weeks.
his weight increases The risk that the correct dose Of thiopental cannot be Determined and he will therefore Not be properly anesthetized.
bullshit. Some kid over at The public defender's office Wants to play tv lawyer
and he throws the eighth Amendment at us.
experts agree if the first Drug doesn't work, the execution Could be excruciating.
it took 3 hours for that sick Bastard to rape and torture A 17-year-old girl and now he's Using cruel and unusual Punishment to get off? Come on.
court's never gonna buy this.
Really? Now why is that?
because it's unjust?
come on, doctors, we live by The rule of law.
and the law States that execution by lethal Injection be of sufficient Dosage to quickly and painlessly Cause death.
but someone clovis' size, We can't absolutely guarantee That.
the only way to make sure That the execution goes properly
is if he sheds some of that Blubber, pronto.
so you picked us to give him Liposuction and a tummy tuck,
out of all of the plastic Surgeons in the state?
in exchange for your Services, the d. A.'s willing to Shorten your son's prison term.
he could be up for parole in
no, no, no. If you want our Help, matt gets out now. Period.
well, I believe I can Convince the district attorney To consider your offer.
you know what, we need to Discuss this, if you don't Mind, in private.
Oh, sure. Listen...
sooner or later, clovis is fish Food.
now the only issue is Whether he gets to stuff his Face for another 15 years while His appeal winds its way Through the courts.
your son's still young, doctor.
isn't his life worth more than That of an unrepentant murderer?
what's this?
this, my bombay baby, Is a chimango martini,
one of my new brilliant Inventions.
Mmm. It's good.
Where's wilber?
he had another little Accident.
Jesus. And I'm spending what, 275 a session, which I can't Afford, on this charlatan kiddie Shrink, and he's still pissing In his bed.
you know what they Do together?
do you have any Idea what they do together? They play candyland. Candyland!
honey, he's fine. I changed His sheets,
I read him a story. He's sleeping like a little Lamb.
I want you to enjoy your Drink because I'm serving you Dinner.
OK. What's going on, kimmie, huh?
you tired of driving that old Camry, you got your eyes On a porsche or something?
I am expanding my culinary Horizons.
it's called making An effort, christian.
I'm pregnant, christian.
I don't want any more kids, Kimber.
I can't afford any more Kids, ok?
emotionally or Financially. I want things to Get easier, not harder.
I understand.
but sometimes Unexpected things happen for A reason, and you love kids.
I'm 45 years old, ok? I already got 3 kids.
frankly, my dear, Parenting is not your long suit.
you know, that grandchild of Mine, she already is showing Signs of becoming a world-class Spoiled brat.
come here. Come here.
you just have to make up your Mind.
a check For its schooling, or me.
it's not an "it," christian.
you can't have both.
why can't you just say You'll sleep on it?
please?
you cooked this shit For nothing.
thank you, dr. Mcnamara, That's enough. You can stop The singing.
and can you lose the hats? We're not babies.
we look ridiculous.
that's 'cause mom keeps Treating us like we're four.
I know. You know, amy popped Her cherry when she was 12
and I've been having an affair With my homeroom teacher For almost 6 weeks.
we're not babies.
he's gonna miss having that Rhino schnozz up his ass.
OK, that's enough. I'll take that.
we about ready here?
let's count back from 100.
OK.
good morning, christian.
so glad you could join us.
Yeah. What's so freakin' good About it?
well, besides the celebration Of the krumholtz twins' sweet Sixteen,
I slept much better Last night once I realized We're not going to give lipo To mr. Clovis.
the deal's off?
why'd they change their mind?
they didn't. I did.
I called special agent thomas This morning and I told her We are not interested.
you'd rather see your son rot In prison then help fry A child murderer?
if anyone gets wind that we Gave lipo to a man just so he Could be executed, we're going To be doing much worse than Two for one birthday nose jobs.
you're such a selfish Bastard, do you know that?
you're more worried about your Solid gold reputation than you Are about your own son.
tell you what--you can be The one to tell him.
Oh! Jesus!
is everything in this goddamn Place expired?
your man thong's on too Tight?
you've been in a foul Mood all day.
Kimber's pregnant.
Congratulations. Is it yours?
Yes, of course it's mine.
it's bullshit, that's what is. She wants to keep it.
I mean, Can you believe the balls On that chick?
you don't get it, do you?
that's the only way she thinks She can hold onto you.
she already has me.
nobody has you.
we can see you, we can talk to You.
but you don't let anybody In.
it's the only guarantee That kimber has that you'll Stick around.
Hey, dad. - Hi!
so, they let everyone have Full contact with family now?
are you kidding me? No.
but since you're doing The operation on wesley, they've Been treating me a lot better In here.
Really?
Yeah, you have no Idea, man. You saved my life.
look, when I get out of here, I promise,
I'm going to bust my Ass to turn things around, ok?
you're gonna see. I owe you that much.
matt...I've decided I'm not going to do The surgery.
I can't operate on a man just so He can be put to death.
I'm sorry. I wanted you to hear It from me first.
I thought--I thought you Agreed so that I could be Released.
no. And it still doesn't Change what I'm being asked to Do, which is compromise My ethics as a doctor.
your ethics?!
you take an oath when you Dedicate yourself to medicine,
and the basis of that thing I've Built my life on is first, Do no harm.
I can't go against Everything I stand for and risk My reputation right now, even if It means keeping you here.
so what you're saying is, That pedophile, that child Rapist, means more to you then Your own son.
no, that is not what I'm saying.
no, I get it, man. You don't give a shit about me.
you haven't for a long time.
I told you, I'm happy to help With your appeal.
my appeal? I don't need an Appeal.
what I want is to get The hell out of here, and now You're telling me I can't

I came to drive you home.
Yeah, I understand.
listen...At the time, I just
I didn't think I could raise A child by myself.
and I knew that I if I had A down syndrome baby with Christian, it would be By myself.
Yeah.
but the thing is is that I
I wanted to have this baby So bad, and I begged him.
I mean, I begged him.
and I even thought, maybe like You, you know, I could just Do it ony own.
and then, I even entertained The idea of...
marry you?
Yeah. We're both not getting Any younger.
everybody has got Baggage. Divorce, kids.
the important thing Is that you find the right Person that you want to spend The rest of your life with.
but in the end, it's Christian that I just can't live Without.
and I just want to be With him, liz. I want to marry Him.
I just want to spend The rest of my life with him, I always have.
and that's what I want more than Anything, even more than this Baby.
and I know it sounds Awful
no, it doesn't. And I know, You have got a bad case Of christian.
you got it worse than any of us.
I know! God.
the thing is, I know that I have Screwed up so bad with jenna.
I mean, it's painful for me.
so I guess I just wanted Christian to see that I could Be
Hi. Ok.
I'm going to do this.
you know it's going to be ok.
right? I mean, who knows?
in a year, christian might want Another baby.
right? - maybe. Yeah.
well, you're ally a strong Woman, liz.
I can see why Christian married you.
all right. - all right.
I'll be back.
I'll be right here.
OK. - ok.
Hi. - this way.

your fever's going down.

to what do I owe the pleasure?
I was helping kimber.
she's not feeling so well, But I think she's finally Gone to sleep.

just tell me what's Going on.
I drove her home from The hospital.
after she had...The procedure.
so she got rid of it?
Yeah.
she got rid of "it.
well, I guess that means I'm getting married.
well, you know, I guess I Should, ahem, go congratulate The misses.
Oh, no, please. Don't.
there were complications.
what kind of complications?
a perforation.
her cervix was retroverted.
Lizzie, stop it with this. Just please, say it.
she can't have any more Children.
not that that matters to you, Because you don't want any more, Right?
now I know she's no mother Teresa, but she cannot have Any more babies.
so if at some point in the Future you decide to leave her,
put that little piece of Information into the equation
as a reminder of just what She gave up to be with you.
why did she come to you Instead of coming to me?
Why? Because she was scared, And I had done it before.
and because I was not the one Who told her to do it.
did you come to tell me The deal's off?
what?
No! We come to bring you this.
can't have you heading out On your first day of freedom In the same rags you came in Here in.
we checked with the warden. You can take that back to your Cell and change while you wait For your release.
Thanks. - you're welcome!
so this means wesley's going To b.
in an hour.
they figured out a way to do It without pain, then?
that's why we're here.
to make sure the doses are Correct, to answer any questions Before they put him to sleep.
what made you change your Mind?
I didn't change my mind.
I always thought wesley should Pay for what he did.
just like anyone who commits A crime should.
all right, sean, come on.
he's paid plenty for his Mistakes.
haven't you? I mean, it's not Like you murdered or raped Anybody, like that asshole.
I know you're going to be a good Boy, aren't you?
Yeah, that's right. - you promise?
you see? He's gonna be A changed man.
wait.
there's something I need to tell You guys first.
about wesley and the execution.
what?
he's told people...
what?
that if he ever gets out of Here, he'll do it again.
he's a very sick man, And you should have no remorse For what you're doing.
and I'm sorry for what I said To you.
I know you were just trying to Do the right thing. You're my dad and I love you.
I don't want to see this.
you don't have a choice.
it's part of the deal.
we're the only ones who know how Much fat we sucked out of him.
they want to stop murderers, They should televise this shit.
if they want to abolish The death penalty, they should Televise it.
we shouldn't have done this.
no regrets, all right?
I mean, come on. This guy Was going to die anyway.
and now your son loves you Again, right? It's a good thing.
besides, we've seen people die Before. Hell, we threw them In the swamp.
this is painless and justified.
you trying to convince me Or yourself?
the prisoner wants to see You two.
is it supposed to hurt this bad?
we haven't administered The drugs yet, wesley.
no, I mean the surgery.
I was up puking all night.
I couldn't eat my last meal.
didn't they give you The pain meds?
I asked about them, but they Said it would interfere With--with the stuff.
one of you want to double Check my numbers?
I've never seen this much Sodium thiental prescribed.
that's kind of the point.
can't we just give him some Versed to calm him down?
the barbiturates won't be Affected
this isn't beverly hills.
the incision's infected. You didn't see that?
guys, as long as the numbers In the file are correct, It's all gonna be fine.
Yeah, they're fine.
time to go.
tell me it's not going to hurt.
tell me it's not going-- - it's not going to hurt.
Wesley, look at me.
it's not going to hurt, I promise, ok? You're just gonna Go to sleep.
Mr. Clovis, the governor of California has denied your final Request for clemency.
do you have any final words?
calling it at 3: 17 p. M.
can we get our son Back now?
Yeah. I'll go finish his paperwork.
it's all over now, Mr. Martel.
I guess so.
it doesn't feel like it, though.
you guys are screwing each other.
you really don't give a shit about me. - I tried.
stop it, please...
no, I won't stop... not until we're together again.
I am pregnant.
it's Sean's sperm.
and this is? - Ramona my fiance.
I'm gonna work for her father in his carpet business.
Matt doesn't want either of you in his life anymore.
the whole therapy thing is bullshit.
you're right. We should just end it, end us.
OK. You ok there, dad?
Yeah. Yeah. - Ok.
so, Mr. And Mr. Krieger, tell me what you don't like about yourself?
I see you're both booked for the consult.
we want our tattoos removed.
Oh. This strikes me as a very big decision.
Yes. Well, it first occurred to me when I was watching this documentary on the TV about Buchenwald.
and suddenly, I was overwhelmed.
and I thought, well, we have lived such a great life.
we've survived so much since then.
so, I... I want to erase this obsession with terrible things from the past.
you can see, she... she's a remarkable woman.
that's not what you said in the car, dad.
Allie, please. Shh.
how can I keep my mouth shut when holocaust deniers are more vocal than ever?
when so many survivors have passed, why would you want to erase one single reminder?
my daughter is upset, and I understand.
she has a different perspective.
and you, Walter? Are you sure this is what you want?
at the end of the day, I want what Edith wants.
she is my inspiration.
this will be a chance, a second chance, for some joy.
and I can give it to her?
Yes. Take... take it off.
you need to be aware that, uh, the work on the elderly is not as simple.
the skin is much thinner, healing takes longer, and infection is always a possibility.
doctor, after what we've been through, please. This is bupkis.
Yeah.
God. These new corporate taxes are killing our bottom line.
for every set of implants we do, it's like Uncle Sam gets one titty for himself.
still, it's a pretty good net, all things considered.
I guess you're right...
for those tax returns over the years.
well, I should get going.
you can get all that stuff to the accountant, all right?
you're not staying? I got dinner coming.
no. I'd love to, but, uh...
maybe some other time.
uh, hey.
Hey.
uh, can I come in?
Hey, Matty. You brought enough for 3, right?
Yeah, of course.
is this some kind of setup?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Wow. Smells good.
Yeah. Ramona's been cooking all day.
OK. I guess I'm staying for a bite.
good. I'll get some plates.
so, your fiance cooked all of this?
Yeah. She was just trying to support me.
and after we heard what happened at the shrink's office, you know...
Oh. Uh, she actually wanted me to bring you both this.
what is it?
it's in Spanish. I don't know what...
Oh. Uh, let's see. It says, uh,
please join us in celebrating the marriage of our daughter Ramona Perez and Matt McNamara.
casual attire,
then something about parking instructions. I don't know.
I, uh, started learning Spanish.
I want Jenna to be bilingual, especially since half her family is gonna be speaking it soon.
so, you're inviting us to your wedding, yeah?
Yeah.
I thought you didn't want us in your life anymore.
Ramona has made me see just how important family is.
I was on the can all night after those tamales.
I know. I even had mine for breakfast.
she's mine. - Oh, you think so?
Yup.
good morning.
how can we help you, miss?
I know you like 'em young, Ava, but shouldn't you at least wait for his testicles to descend?
his name is Rafael. He's my adopted son.
as I recall, you left your last son on the floor to decompose while you dashed off to gay Paris.
after I left, I,uh, I rented a small pension in
le Quartier Latin where I wept for days.
weeks passed before I received a letter from Baltimore.
Adrian's death had been determined to be a suicide, which it was. I was cleared of all wrongdoing.
so, naturally, you jumped on the next plane back to Miami to give your son a proper burial.
I used my grief as fuel to move on.
Adrian was covered in maggots.
stop!
please. Have a little decency.
I don't think you should be lecturing us on decency.
look. Whatever you're here for, there's no procedure we could do that Dr. Moore couldn't do just as well.
Barrett's dead.
series of strokes.
I am not the monster you think I am.
all my life, I've tried to turn tragedy into something meaningful.
I started a foundation with the money Barrett left me that subsidizes corrective surgery for third-world children.
leishmaniasis.
it looks like leprosy.
black fever, Jericho buttons, the same thing.
it's endemic in areas around the Amazon.
amphotericin b, I think, is the recommended treatment.
side effects are horrible, often lethal in a child his age.
would he survive? My brave little Rafael?
he's free of the parasite, but as you can see, it's left its mark.
so, why bring him to us?
because you're the best, and
I want what's best for my son.
you'd do the same for Matt, wouldn't you?
you know, why don't you leave your contact information at the desk, and we'll send you a list of referrals?
and please don't ever talk about Matt again.
Rafael's only crime was being born into poverty.
and now he's scarred for life.
I'm trying to give him a second chance.
perhaps you think that Beverly Hills matrons who come to you for face-lifts are more deserving.
we're not doing it.
don't get carried away.
she's evil. That baby is just a sick child.
and it is intriguing from a medical point of view.
look. I know you and I try to mend fences and all that bullshit.
I get it, ok? But I don't give a shit if Ava comes in here with baby Jesus himself.
we're not helping her.
all right. This procedure will only take about 20 minutes, as soon as our anesthesiologist gets off the phone.
where are my tunes?
OK, I'm sorry. That was my gynecologist.
I just got my CVS results.
my baby is perfect.
Oh, Mazel Tov. How far along are you, darling?
I am 12 weeks, just past my first trimester.
can we dial down the estrogen, please, and get my music cranking?
the machine's on the fritz.
Dr. Troy, could I sing a song for my wife? It will relax her.
fine by me.
I didn't think you weren't coming into town for a few days.
you look great, Julia.
thank you, Christian.
you haven't changed a bit.
Thanks.
so, where are Connor and Annie?
uh, they're at the hotel.
I thought it best that I came to see you first.
Oh, you gotta see my new apartment.
there's plenty of room. You guys could stay there.
it's probably easier than a hotel.
I'm getting married again, Sean.
Congrats. Good for you.
is it 2 brides? 2 grooms?
woman? Beast?
his name's Edmund, and, um, he lives in Knightsbridge, in England.
and he has an estate somewhere that's been in the family for, like, 400 years.
uh, what about our kids?
I want them to come with me.
Yeah, well, London is a 10-hour flight from L. A.so...
Yeah, I know. And, um, well, I need your permission.
you know, it's hard enough finding time to fly across the country to see them.
now I'm supposed to fly across the Atlantic?
they need their father. Ok?
they need a stable family.
well, I'm not giving up my rights to my children just so you can play house 6, 000 miles away.
it's bullshit, is what it is.
I can't take a week off from work every time I want to see my kids.
it's not realistic. And what about the time difference?
if I don't call them by noon L. A. time, they'll be in bed.
can I get a 400?
you know, whether we're married or not, we still have to do what's best for the kids.
and she's not remembering that.
you know, I think that you're the one who's forgetting what this is about.
you're really losing her.
Julia?- Mm-hmm.
what are you saying?
look, I know how you feel about the kids.
but what you're really pissed off about is, she's going.
she's going for good this time. And you still love her.
so, tell me about this guy.
um... well, he's a little older than I am.
he's very intellectual. He reads a lot.
he's, um, I don't know.
he's charming.
rich? - Oh!
I hope. I don't want you flitting off to London with some kind of saggy-balled bookworm from Barnes & Noble.
well, let's just say he works very hard, and his balls are far from saggy.
good. - Ok?
how pissed is Sean?
you are stealing his kids.
I know. Uh, we all have to move on with our lives.
you're getting no arguments from me. Trust me. Not on that one.
you look great.
thank you.
so do you.
Thanks.
how are you doing?
in all honesty, this whole Sean thing's got me a little...
you do know that he dragged me to couple therapy.
then you know he's always gone through these dark phases.
you know he did when we were married.
he... he gets through it.
this time feels different, though.
you look great.
I'll be right back.
you want to know what's weird?
every time I see you, I get a hard-on.
after all these years...
does it have to be you...
when I can put it in my pants?
Christian, stop.
you're moving very, very far away.
coming.
I'd fire my receptionist if she gave out personal information.
but then again, I'm very persuasive.
sorry. I, uh, I should have called, but...
you would have said no.
I still could say no.
to a woman with a baby who needs your help?
no, Sean. You're not that man.
you want a drink?
no, thanks, but feel free.
I know you had a hard day.
you two should see a professional.
and by "you two," I assume you mean...
your... other half.
notice I didn't say "better.
well, we're fine.
you're either in denial, or you're very selective about the reality you accept.
he's beautiful.
Yeah.
he will be.
but his spirit is sheer radiance.
so, we'll keep looking for a doctor who will help me...
so that his appearance can match the soul that's inside.
I know you want to.
there are so many children who could use your help.
it's your choice, you know?
you don't need his approval.
it just feels that way.
Oh, look at you.
I would need all of his medical information... doctors' records, blood workups...
um, I can try to find them.
I've been moving around so much.
no, just give me the name of the hospital where they gave him the amphotericin b, and I will get in touch with them.
why don't you tell me how you got this baby?
I, uh, I told you.
I should have known better than to be taken in by you.
get out.
they had one caretaker for 50 babies... one.
they let them cry themselves to sleep.
after weeks of doing nothing but crying and screaming and wanting to be held...
they learned to stop, to need nothing.
mothering a suicide didn't make me a prime candidate for adoption.
my past, it seems, hangs around my neck like a noose.
I brought a small bag.
seen me with it before, so no one bothered to check it...
empty going in, and with this beautiful... if damaged...
little boy coming out.
was it illegal? Yes.
but you tell me. Was it immoral?
should I have left him there? Scarred? Malnourished?
virtually unadoptable?
so he could grow up alone and outcast for the rest of his life?
like me?
you're incapable of telling the truth.
get out.
maybe I was wrong about you, Sean.
whatever it is that keeps you so locked up and judgmental and unhappy...
maybe it's got nothing at all to do with Christian.
Oh. Doctor, I'm so glad to see you.
we had to take a bus, because my daughter didn't answer her phone.
how you doing, Walter?
this one gets a tattoo...
and that one gets no tattoo
get me a wheelchair.
he woke up this morning.
his arm was swollen like a balloon.
I'm sure it's just a staph infection.
Walter, you're gonna come with me, all right?
you're gonna get up with me.
we're gonna get into the chair. Ok?
the little children! - All right. Here we go.
we're gonna hook you up to an IV, get you into a bed.
you should be fit as a fiddle in a couple of days.
so, this is our finest Berber, perfect for high-traffic areas such as your living room.
um, here. There you go.
take your shoes off.
run your toes through it.
Ooh, I love it, Tony.
how is it with dog pee-pee?
don't start with that again, Anita, ok?
because I'm pretty happy with the linoleum.
Yeah, but you said that when your mom came to live with us that we were gonna be getting new carpeting.
I know that, but I don't know why you always have to criticize...
Hello, Matt.
what are you doing here?
you look good, Matt.
where have you been the past 6 years?
I tried looking for you.
I always things to turn out differently than they did.
I'm getting married in 3 days.
I know. That's why I came.
I, uh, I have a gift for you.
that's a lot of money, Ava.
it's the least I can do after all the horrible things I've done in the past.
you deserve a fresh start.
is everything all right, Matthew?
Yeah, honey. Hi. Um... - Hi.
uh, this is Ava Moore, an old friend of the family.
and she just came by, actually, to give us a wedding gift. Ava, this is my fiance Ramona.
and who is this precious little thing?
uh, that's my daughter Jenna.
Hello, sweetheart.
she's just perfect.
well, I think the three of you make a wonderful family.
I'm so happy for you.
well, thank you.
I have, um, business back in Los Angeles.
Yeah. Traffic gets pretty bad around here.
you might want get on the road early.
I hope your wedding is everything you dream it will be.
Bye, sweetheart.
you good?
same shit, different day.
you ok?
you a little hung over from your bachelorette party with Julia?
very hung over.
did you sleep with her?
no. But it wasn't for lack of trying.
Christian, stop it. Stop.
no. No!
I don't want this.
I used to get butterflies whenever you walked into a room, or if you called the house to talk to Sean and I picked up.
I thought about you when I was making love to other men, even Sean.
and I thought for one second that I felt that way tonight.
but I don't.
I still love you. But that thing that we had, that...
electricity...
that's gone...
forever.
that's kind of a kick in the nuts, huh?
well, one you deserved.
how could you do that? How could you do that to me?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I spill my heart out to you.
I tell you that I'm still in love with her, and you try to screw her in the bathroom of some bar?
Hey. You know what, buddy boy? Like it or not, there's 3 of us.
OK? I'm not saying it's a good thing, but I love her, too.
that's your justification?
I'm sorry if this is hard for you to hear.
if you want to hit me or you want to quit or do whatever it is that you like to do, you just go for it, ok?
but I'm not gonna apologize for what I did last night.
you're right.
we both need to have our own way with this.
I'll be around at 9: 00 to pick up the kids.
if I'm gonna consider this, I think you should stay a bit.
seems the least you could do.
tell me a little bit about this new guy.
Oh, come on.
I won't bite.
Cheers.
so, how did you meet this guy?
um... at a mutual friend's dinner party.
how did he propose?
we were in bed.
in bed?
what, in the throes of passion?
Julia, I don't think you thought this through very well.
Sean, Edmund and I have been talking about marriage for a few months.
now, I know that it's gonna be difficult for the kids being in a new country, but he loves them. And they need him, too, you know?
they need a father who they can see every day.
and you know what?
I can't do it alone anymore.
I'll move to New York, and we can all be together again.
we were a happy family once.
just say the word, and we can have it all back again.
hey...
I still love you. I've always loved you. I never stopped.
Julia, just stay with me tonight.
and I'll show you how good we can be...
Oh, my God. You and Christian... you are unbelievable.
you've never changed.
Sean, you're both trying the sametrick...
professing your love to me like 2 teenagers.
I've grown up. I've moved on.
it's time that you did, too.
I'll pick up the kids at 9: 00.
Walter, when you were delirious, you were talking in German.
and you kept saying this one thing over and over.
you said,"what did we do to the children?
what were you talking about?
Oh... Edith, I... I wouldn't have known what it was.
I was delirious, Edith.
no, no. There was something... in your voice.
there's something different.
when you kept talking about the children, you said, "what did we," like you were one of them.
Edith - Walter, please. Tell me
I'm afraid for nothing.
tell me you don't know what I'm talking about.
I didn't sleep all night.
Walter, what did you do?
I was... I was just a tattooist, Edith.
I was not the exterminator.
is everything all right here?
no. Is not all right.
what are you talking about?
I... I gave the prisoners the tattoos.
only the strong ones.
it meant that they could go to work.
without a tattoo, they would be killed.
when the war was over, and... I escaped to California.
and I promised God to give me a second chance.
if he would give me a second chance, I would live like a Jew.
as a penance, I... I lived with the people that I harmed.
you see here?
I gave myself... I gave myself a tattoo.
and I was your penance?
Edith, why I was given this gift, I do not know, but I was. God gave me you.
God is a joke!
Edith, does it count for nothing? Hmm?
what I have become?
how long I have been a good man?
you always talk about forgiveness.
forgiveness, Edith.
Hi.
I...I came to return this.
Ramona's not comfortable taking it.
and neither am I.
such reverse snobbery.
it would have been easier just to stick it in the mill, I would think.
Yeah, well, I like to drive around sometimes at night.
it clears my head.
clarity's overrated.
Ramona wouldn't object to you just having one drink, would she?
well, maybe just one.
good. Ramona trusts you...
a good precedent to begin one's married life.
Skol.
you've grown older...
even more handsome.
love agrees with you.
Ramona is very down to earth...
and nice.
good. You, um, you deserve someone nice.
you weren't very nice at all.
just incredibly...
what?
beautiful.
you still are.
thank you.
I, uh... I needed that.
you always did know exactly what to say.
sometimes in the dark, when I'm with her,
I think about you.
I fantasize what my life would have been like if I'd come away with you...
if we'd been together.
listen to me, Matt.
you found something nice, stable.
so have I...
beautiful baby boy.
forget this happened. Forget you saw me again.
for your sake and Ramona's, just put me out of your mind.
you can't go.
I won't let you.
I have no choice.
my baby needs help.
Hey. What are you doing here?
Yeah. We don't need any carpet.
Oh, that's very funny, actually.
um, no. I wanted to talk to you guys about something... a wedding gift.
I'd like you to do that surgery on Ava's baby.
did she come to you?
I knew we couldn't trust that bitch.
she's not a bitch, man.
her kid's really messed up.
did you sleep with her?
Matty, Matty, Matty.
she's like a drug to you, as bad as meth.
the second you're around her, you start making bad decisions.
Yeah, she seemed so different, though, you know?
like being a real mom softened her or something.
I'm sure she was all puppy dogs and rainbows until she casually asked you to talk to us about the surgery.
well... that was my idea.
no. That was her idea.
Matt, you've got a shot at the real thing here with Ramona...
true happiness with a great girl.
Ava is just gonna toss you aside the second she's done with you.
I'm such an asshole, and she sucked me right in.
you're not an asshole.
come on, now. What you need to do is, uh, go home and get some sleep.
you're getting married tomorrow.
Mmm. Yeah.
thank you. Thanks, guys.
I, uh, I'm so glad to have you back in my life. And I just want to keep you there.
there are your prescriptions, pain pills, and antibiotics.
why should he get painkillers?
he didn't give his victims any painkillers.
Allison. - You remember Leena Gold from Temple?
Yes.
she works with the Simon Wiesenthal center.
Oh, my God.
Allison, what have you done?
I decided to call the OSL in Washington.
is that part of the Justice Department?
Yes. And if the evidence warrants it, Mr. Krieger, or whatever his name is, will hopefully be deported to stand trial for his crimes.
mom, I'll take you home, and then Leena will stay here with him and wait for them to come.
I'm not going anywhere.
fine. Stay with your Nazi.
he's my husband.
you are not the only one he has to answer to.
Allison, Mein Kind, how are you ever going to live with yourself?
come, Allison. Come, dear.
where does it come from, this capacity to forgive?
how do you do it?
how do you not?
Hey!
Hey.
it's quite a party, huh?
Hey, Matty. You look great.
so...
so... are you ready for this?
you know what? For the first time in my life, yeah.
Yeah, this feels right.
there you are, Matthew!
Hi. - Uh, Celia, this is my dad Sean McNamara.
Oh hello - Hello.
Hi. - You have a wonderful home.
Oh, thank you, Dr. McNamara.
welcome. Come.
OK. Uh...
Hello, hello.
where are the kids?
Annie is helping Ramona to get ready, and Connor is playing with her nephews.
Oh, good. It's easier to do this when they're not around.
what is this?
thank you. Thank you, Sean.
this means so much to me.
OK. Now we finally got that out of our systems, can we please have some fun around here?
uh, yes.
let's have some fun.
OK. Can I suggest one final 3-way?
Oh, come on. - Oh, no.
I mean this kind of 3-way.
Oh. There you go, buddy.
our son's getting married.
maybe we did something right along the way or something like that.
I'll drink to that. - Or something.
I know. Hard to believe.
just MARRIED!
and we soon realized we weren't alone.
is there anything you have ever told me that's true?
Yeah, that i love you.
it's hard to imagine dr. King would be involved.
everything about him is a lie.
I know exactly how you can help me.
Hey, I'm home!
God,Jim!
no.
No,Jim. No.
No!
mom, you're looking at this in all the wrong light.
think of it as...
stimulating the local economy.
no. I am not going to give you an advance on your allowance
so you can just go hang out at the mall with your friends. Answer's no.
mom, just listen for a second.
please... can I have an advance on my allowance
this one last time?
this one last time...
I'll make an exception.
that is so unfair. She never changes her mind when I beg.
you must be, like, the mom whisperer or something.
MMH. Benefits of being the favorite child.
well, you'd be the favorite sister
if you can convince natalie to change her mind about dating me.
Why? I thought you guys were meeting for coffee this morning.
we are. She just doesn't know it yet.
smooth.
have a great day, guys. - Bye, dad. Thank you.
Bye, dad.
Oh, you look nice. Where are you off to?
the same place I go every morning.
work?
you mean, where we just found out that your boss is secretly conducting human experiments?
pretty much. Yeah.
great. Just wanna make sure we're clear on the plan.
look, if I can get close to king
and find the facility where he's been doing this testing,
then we'll have all the proof we need to stop him.
as a crime fighter, i think your plan makes sense,
but as a husband...
Jim, I know you want to protect me,
but we both know I'm the only one that can get us on the inside.
I need you to get on the inside.
Stephanie powell and her husband
have somehow developed abilities.
they're not receiving treatments?
not from me.
she can move at... remarkable speed,
and with his strength,
he can move... anything he wants.
quite the power couple.
we need to study them, find out the extent of their powers.
well, then you came to the right girl.
Dr. King is behind all this?
every super we've fought has one thing in common...
they've gotten their powers courtesy of an experimental medical procedure
administered by... guess who.
Oh. Wow. That's a lot to absorb. Uh.
I think I need to sit.
look, and we still don't know how we got our powers.
I mean, what if... - What if dr. King is behind that, too?
and what if everything that's happened to us
is part of his experiments?
well, you know, good luck finding out.
the villain never reveals his secrets unless he's about to kill the hero.
all right. Not really a preferable scenario.
I just have to figure out a way to get in, gain his trust.
Yeah, but how? You're chock-Full of those pesky morals.
I want her as far away from king as possible.
I don't think that's gonna happen.
Stephanie's got a taste of the crime-Fighting bug,
and me thinks she likey.
what if king figures out
I mean, there's gotta be a way we can take him down
and get her out of global tech as fast as we can.
in the d. A.'S office, when we can't make a case against a target like king,
we flip someone close to him, like an adviser...
or an accountant... - Or a super villain.
these people were given their powers against their will.
if we could get one of 'em to turn against king...
how? I mean, where are we gonna find one? what, just.
you know, run an ad in the personals...
single super seeking same for testing and whistle-Blowing?
or we could trace all calls to and from king's cell.
I already did it. Right here.
it's a federal offense, so you can thank me later.
a few out of state calls, a bunch of 1-800 numbers.
Oh, whoa, whoa. Wh... what about that number?
bunch of calls there. - That could be our guy.
get me an address. We'll find out.
Hey.
it's so weird that we're here at the same time.
what a random phenomenon in the probability theory of... breakfast.
I come here every morning,
which you knew, making it a known variable and not very random.
for the record, if this were a romantic comedy,
you would've found that totally charming.
you've been...adorably...
persistent.
and here comes the "but."
but you and me getting back together is...
impossible.
what's wrong?
her locket.
I'm sorry. It's just.it just looks like the one
my mom used to wear all the time, that's all.
you can ask her where she got it.
I'm sure she'd sell it back to you, if she...
we didn't sell my mom's locket, j. J. It was taken from her.
she didn't die because she was sick or something.
she was murdered.
according to this,
she and a co-Worker were walking home when they were robbed and then shot.
the co-worker survived, but natalie's mom wasn't so lucky.
the case was never solved.
you better not be thinking what i think you're thinking.
you already know what i'm thinking.
stay out of it, j. J.
if there was a way to solve this, the cops would've done it already.
if this locket is actually her mom's, it's a clue...
a clue the police never had... and if i can figure this out,
she can finally move on with her life and have some closure.
and then fall into the arms of her nerd in shining armor.
this isn't about me.
you didn't see her face today when she saw the locket.
I just want to help her.
mom? What are you looking for?
honey, I just thought i'd do a little straightening up during my lunch break.
you came all the way home to clean our bathroom?
all the way is, like, 10 seconds with super speed.
but you cleaned last night.
I did, but, i mean, look at this place.
do you know how quickly bacteria re-Accumulates?
Hello? - Where are you?
at home with the kids. Why?
there's something important I need to tell you.
uh, hold on.
it's dr. King.
what's going on? - Stephanie just left work,
and she's on her way home.
thanks for the warning.
I'd hate for us to come face-To-Face.
nice building.
whoever king's been calling is in a much higher tax bracket than i am.
will you just look for apartment 20-B?
the tenant's name is jeremy waldren.
king's phone records show he's called this guy more than 20 times in the last 3 days.
so unless this guy is his bookie or his shrink,
he's probably involved in whatever king is up to.
uh, no one's home. - Dude, you had me comit a federal offense.
the least you could do is pop a doorknob.
Ah, the hell with it.
I'm in.
what do you see? - Not much.
no photos, no mail.
nothing to indicate...
anything.
Jim, what's happening?
Oh, my god. - What? What is it?
?? Tell me what you're seeing.
Hey, chris. What's up?
Hey, uh, what are you doing right now?
not much. I gotta help my brother with something later, - But... - My bike won't start.
I could really use a ride. Plus, I figured...
it was a good excuse to see you.
hang on. I'm on my way.
I'll be here.
what are you doing?
mom said that she had washed my favorite pair of jeans,
and i couldn't find them.
okay. Well, we should get going.
where?
to the coffee shop. You said you'd help me
with the case... natalie's mom and the locket.
Oh, god.
please tell me you haven't lost your memory again.
no, I didn't.
I just don't know why you need my help.
can't you figure this locket thing out on your own?
I spent the last hour memorizing 27 books on criminal behavior,
so now I know over a thousand theories on how to entrap a suspect,
but they're still just theories.
my super-Brain can only get me so far.
look, if I could read minds, i wouldn't need you, but i do, so let's go.
I can see how that would be very handy.
sorry. I can't. I gotta go meet chris.
good chat.
very, uh... Educational.
to what do i owe this unexpected pleasure?
Yeah, i've been thinking about chiles' research...
the development of the serum, the super-Humans he created...
and I can't help but wonder what tremendous social impact
his work might have had had he continued.
his trials were ethically questionable,
not to mention illegal.
I believe he was on to something that could change the course of history,
and I want to be part of that change.
do you?
with your permission, I would like to continue with his trials.
under your supervision, of course.
I understand your desire to help people,
but until there's a way to do it ethically,
I'm sorry, stephanie.
we'll just have to be patient.
uh, excuse me. Um, thank you for your time.
Jim, slow down. Why are you in this man's apartment?
you wanted to track king at work. - Yeah, it was a total bust.
well, I thought i'd investigate his life outside of global tech.
and as it turns out, - He's been investigating us. - What?
what did you find? - Dozens of surveillance photos.
it's like he's had someone watching our every move.
Oh, my god. - I'm gonna have to call the kids,
warn them that we're being followed.
no. I mean, you really think we should involve them?
unfortunately, they already are.
Hi, daddy. - Oh, thank god you answered.
are you okay? - Yeah. Why wouldn't i be?
all right, daphne,
I... I don't want to scare you,
but have you noticed anyone suspicious a... around your school,
around the neighborhood?
a... anyone out of place? - No.
what are you talking about?
someone's been following our family.
I'll explain later. I just wanted to make sure you and your brother are okay.
Yeah. We're fine.
J. J.'S there?
Yep. Staring right at him. - Okay, now listen up.
neither of you leave the house. You got it?
don't answer the phone, don't talk to anybody, just...
I'll take care of this.
how exactly are you going to do that? - Don't worry about it.
you two just stay safe.
Hey!
why didn't you wait up for me? You said you needed my help.
I thought you weren't coming.
you said you had to go meet chris. - I did, but he wasn't there.
wait. I didn't tell you i was meeting him, did i?
whatever.
all right, that's her.
watch my back.
can i get a double espresso? - A little young, don't you think?
they say caffeine increases brain activity.
nice locket. Where'd you get it?
my, uh... boyfriend gave it to me.
that's $2.
she's lying. She hesitated before answering.
alone that isn't a clear indicator,
but combined with the increased blink rate
and the way her voice went up half an octave...
Oh, Okay. Okay. Calm down, sherlock. I get it.
sorry. The reason my brother was asking about the locket is we wanna get one for our mom.
do you know where your boyfriend got it?
God, I hate nosy kids.
he didn't tell me, but i'm pretty sure it's one-Of-A-Kind, so...
you owe $2.
stop lying. Just tell us where you really got the locket.
I saw it in an antique shop, the one on windward.
it was way overpriced, so I stole it.
thanks for the coffee.
take it.
maybe this whole thing's a trap.Jim, I want you to get out of there now.
this apartment is our only lead.
I'm not leaving here till I know who we're dealing with.
Yeah, but what do you have in mind?
whether waldren exists or not,
someone's been here to answer king's calls.
I should dust for prints. - Yeah, right,
like you happened to bring a dusting kit with you.
you know what, george?
sometimes you just gotta improvise.
who the hell are you?!
you're in my apartment.
shouldn't i be asking you that question?
are you working for king? Why are you watching my family?
look, I know this all appears rather indicting, but.
you truly have nothing to be afraid of.
I can prove it to you. Just look at my I. D.
the entire family has powers?
the daughter's a mind reader.
and the boy?
in a stunningly self-Congratulatory moment,
he diagnosed himself as having a super-Brain.
and you think that the powells are
maintaining permanence?
their powers appear to be stable.
there's no serum to be found. - Amazing.
Ah, but if anyone could figure out a way,
it would be dr. Powell.
I need you to find out more.
Jim powell's on to me.
so eliminate him.
sorry? - Eliminate him
and replace him.
wait. So this plan... getting rid ofJim...
is it to ensure the success of the program?
well, your feelings for her are understandable.
you would be wise to focus on the task at hand.
RemoveJim powell from the equation.
got it.
and she just vanished into the crowd.
what is it about beautiful women?
one minute they're right there, the next minute, they take the good couch and they're gone.
so you can't find a single match for her in the system?
no. And I need to know who the hell i'm dealing with here.
just relax. Once i'm out of trial, we will go to the lair and crack this,
I promise. We will find her.
no one just disappears outta thin air.
you're supposed to be at work.
well, this morning you said you weren't feeling well,
so i brought you some "tom yum" soup.
it is the thai equivalent of chicken noodle.
Aw. You're sweating. - Yeah, it's nothing. It's hot in here.
you're going through withdrawal again.
when was the last time you took the serum?
my dosage ran out.
okay.
then you go back to dr. King and you get some more, - At least until we figure out... - I won't do that.
well, then you have to let me tell dr. Powell the truth about you,
because if there's anyone who can help you, it's her.
that's not true.
you can help me.
you know as much about the trilsettum plant as dr. Powell.
you can replicate king's formula.
please, katie.
I need you.
I have a few questions about a locket.
this is what the locket looked like.
do you remember it?
Yeah. This one was stolen a few weeks ago. You know anything about that?
no. I just need the contact information of who originally sold it to you.
not gonna happen. I don't give out client information.
but... i got some earrings i can sell you real cheap.
maybe the word that my brother was missing was "please."
give him all the information you have about that locket right now...
please.
the guy wouldn't give me his name. I remember i paid him with a check.
his signature's on the back, i'll get it for you.
Thanks.
so helpful. - How did you do that?
I didn't do anything. He just had a change of heart.
you are so lying. You just blinked 8 times in 2. 3 seconds.
this criminology stuff's getting really irritating.
Plus, the allowance advance from mom this morning?
the confession from the barista? And now
contact info for... kyle rainey?
what's going on, daphne? Something's up.
just leave it alone, j. J.
forget it. I'm just gonna leave it alone.
wait a minute.
you just did it to me.
you're not just reading thoughts, you're creating them,
placing them in people's minds.
why didn't it work on you?
probably because i exercise 38% more control over my brain than most people do.
but you know who doesn't?
Kyle rainey.
with the right kind of influence, he can tell us where he got that locket.
Katie, i was wondering if you wanted me to order the usu...
okay, i know what this looks like.
it looks like you're stealing the trilsettum coronis from the lab.
good. So we're clear on that.
I have a good reason. Joshua... he needs it.
Why?
I can't tell you.
I'm sorry. My honor code explicitly...
Oh. Okay, just pretend i have wonder woman's rope of truth around you,
and you feel compelled to disclose everything.
technically, it's a lasso. - Katie.
okay.
Joshua's one of them.
he's a super.
what?
W...
why... why would you keep this from me?
because he asked me to keep his secret, just like you asked me to keep yours.
and remember when he was sick? Well, he wasn't exactly sick per se,
he was going through withdrawal.
withdrawal?
he got his powers from...
Dr. King's treatments.
Mm-hmm. And now he doesn't want to take the serum anymore.
and he's trying to quit, but his body won't let him.
so i'm trying to replicate the formula.
joshua needs your help, dr. Powell.
I need your help,
and whatever he is,
I just... I love him.
I can't get anything off of this print.
no D. M.V. Record, no passport, It's like she doesn't even exist.
Oh, she exists.
What?! You shot me!
what the... i have someone stalking my family,
and you're playing around with guns?
I thought you didn't even like guns.
I... I... I was putting it away,
and I guess the safety must've been off.
well, hurry up, I.
I want to run a search on the fingerprints we found in the apartment.
I'm gonna just get us some snacks, and i'll be right back.
another day, another victory! You know what?
I keep winning cases like this, they're gonna have to build
a statue of me outside the courthouse.
court? What are you talking about?
I thought you went to get snacks. - Snacks from where?
from your house, where you went,
after you shot me in the back.
okay, wait a minute.
let's back up...
a whole lot, like, right to where you said i shot someone.
you were standing right there with a gun.
maybe it was someone else. You know, we don't all look alike,Jim.
Oh, my god.
what?
there's only one way you could've been at the court and in the lair at the same time...
is if one of the yous wasn't you.
okay, look, you know what I'll do?
I'll go outside and then we can just start over...
no, no, no. Hold up. Hold up.
a... a few weeks back, Steph crossed paths with a...
a woman who was some sort of shape-shifter.
shape-shifter?
and that redhead who I chased out of the apartment today...
if that's what she is...
maybe I didn't lose her on the street after all.
maybe she turned into someone else.
and that, apparently, into you.
I don't get it.
why would someone shoot someone who's bulletproof?
maybe she doesn't know that you're bulletproof.
that's why she's spying on you guys.
she's trying to find your weaknesses.
he's seen your face.
it's only a matter of time before he discovers your identity.
unless he already has.
well, I'm sure he's just looking for his wife.
well, see that he finds her.
Jim. Honey. What are you doing here?
we have to talk, in private.
we're not safe.
that shape-shifter who infiltrated your lab... she's back.
how do you know?
well, she kind of gave herself away by impersonating George and trying to kill me.
I think she's the one who's been tracking us.
somehow she discovered our powers, and now she's trying to find out our kryptonite.
well, how do you know she hasn't already?
well, because I'm still alive and you're...
Jim. You... you think that I'm her?
I think we can't be too careful about anybody right now.
you're right.
but who else do you know who's reading the new Jonathan Franzen, has a thing for vanilla bean energy bars, and keeps a vial of lavender oil on her bedside table?
just my wife.
okay, well, the most important thing is that we do not talk about our powers with anyone...
George, Katie, not even the kids.
and since we only know my weakness...
so long as I don't kiss anybody wearing your cinoxate lip stuff...
we should be fine.
well, honey, if you kiss anyone besides me,
I'll kill you before she does.
this is a bad idea. You don't know anything about this guy.
I'm just gonna ask a few questions, and if we find something, we tell it to the police.
excuse me. Mr. Rainey?
Yeah. Can I help you?
maybe. Uh...
we're here about a locket that you sold ten years ago.
ten years ago, huh? That's... that's a long time ago.
Hey, honey. I brought you some, uh...
Oh. I'm sorry. I didn't realize...
sorry to be intruding, uh, we're trying to help a friend out, and we thought that maybe your husband could help us.
Oh.
Yeah. Her name's Natalie Poston. Her mom... - Poston?
do you know her? - I did.
you two used to work together, right? - Yeah. Yeah, we did.
listen, sweetheart, why don't you let me handle this? I'll... I'll be right in, okay?
sure. Okay. - Thank you.
dinner's almost ready. - Okay.
wait. The article that I read said that she was with a co-worker the night that she was murdered.
were you... - Yeah. I was shot, too.
nearly died.
I... I've been through ??
so I'm sorry about your friend and all, but, uh, I think you guys should probably go.
if you have nothing to hide, then why are you so anxious for us to leave?
I don't know what kind of host I'd be if I didn't offer you both some iced tea.
Thanks.
wait. Wait. Wait. You don't have to do this.
don't! Don't!
No! No! Aah!
are you okay?
no.
it's... it's nothing.
my phone is on vibrate, and I should really get this.
J. J. would you like to come with me?
to answer your phone?
no, I'm good.
excuse me.
how much do you love me?
not enough to shout it out loud in a room full of other men.
Yeah, but listen, there's a reason you came up short on those prints.
the lair's computer was only linked to the precinct database, which means you can only get an I. D.
if the perp has a criminal record.
so I took the liberty of widening the search, and your girl's prints came up in social services.
Amelia Hammond. Parents died in a car crash.
no surviving relatives, so she ends up in foster care.
eventually, she's adopted by Dr. Dayton King.
Hey, Daph. What's up?
dad, J. J. and I did something we shouldn't have, and now we're in trouble.
whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down, Daphne. What's wrong?
you have to come to 21, Brush Hill Road.
you have to come right now, we know who killed... - You forgot your tea.
Daphne? Hello? Daphne?
what did you do to her?
if I were you, I'd worry more about myself right now.
Melissa, put the gun down!
I'm not helping you cover up another murder!
shut up.
it was you. You killed Natalie's mother.
she was sleeping with my husband.
Oh, my God, Daphne.
I just wanted to scare her, but the gun went off.
look, I was just trying to protect my family, like I'm trying to do right now.
please. You don't have to do this.
please. No, don't do it. - Shut up.
I'm sorry.
dad?
what the hell?
dad! Dad!
all right. Daphne?
you all right?
Oh, what happened?
it was awesome! Dad smashed through the door...
we'll talk about this later.
the cops are on the way.
let's get out of here. Let's go.
Dr. Powell.
come in. I'm... I'm sorry, come on in.
thank you.
you asked for Katie's help, but you're going to get mine instead.
you synthesized the serum.
better. I'm working on my own serum, one that'll counter the trilsettum effect.
you'll no longer have your powers, but you'd be...
normal?
Yes. It's gonna take some time.
the counter-serum will act as a beta blocker, which will keep your organs from degenerating.
and you're doing this in exchange for what?
nothing.
no strings attached.
everything I do is to help my family, to protect them, and Katie... well, she's my family, too.
but if you ever do anything to harm her, there'll be no serum to protect you from me.
are you out of your minds?!
investigating a murder on your own? What were you two thinking?
uh, on a scale of one to we're grounded for the rest of our lives, - what are we looking at? - The rest of your lives about covers it.
but right now we have bigger problems to deal with.
sorry. Had a meeting that ran late.
it's okay.
I... I was just about to fill the kids in on the shape-shifter.
hang on.
hello.
Hey, honey, I was stuck in a meeting, but I'm leaving now.
okay. Um...
right.
thanks for letting me know.
everything all right, sweetheart?
sure. Everything's fine.
who was that on the phone?
that was... just George, you know, usual George stuff.
kids, uh, why don't you head upstairs?
come on. I was just about to eat. - Upstairs now.
this would be the wrong time not to listen.
take your brother upstairs. Lock the door.
come on, J. J.
so I'm guessing that wasn't George on the phone.
no.
that was my wife. - Hmm.
the one I actually married.
you're right there.
I want you out of our lives now.
too late.
when I kissed you, I took away your superpowers, making it extremely easy for me to kill you.
it's okay.
with or without my powers, I'm pretty confident I can still kick your ass.
probably.
but can you kick yours?
if I don't have powers, that means you don't have powers either.
kudos. I see you're up on your rules on shape-shifting.
but I don't think I'll need them.
once you're gone, how will anyone prove I'm not you?
my family knows a lot more about me than just how I look.
but you wouldn't understand that, would you, Amelia?
look at that.Jim thinks he's being clever.
we know a lot more about Dr. King's plans than you think.
well, then you must know that Dr. King has his eyes set on your wife.
why else do you think he sent me here to kill you?
Hey. I'm home.
Oh, God.Jim!
No!
No!Jim.
no.
it's okay. I'm okay.
she... she's dead, isn't she?
what are we gonna do?
thank you for coming.
I guess I owed you.
don't worry about this. I'll take care of her.
you knew her? - She was a friend.
more than a friend once upon a time.
I'm sorry. - Don't be.
she paid for her choices.
that's why I'm trying to make better ones.
I didn't tell you about me because I didn't want you to get involved any more deeply than you already are.
it's just too dangerous.
not for us, it isn't.
if we work together, we can stop King.
you think Dr. King is in charge?
this is so much bigger than any of you think.
and as soon as King finds out Victoria's dead, he's gonna come after your family with a vengeance.
W... well, then he has to think she's still alive.
look, if she can pretend to be us, we can pretend to be her.
you'll never be able to convince him.
I just need one thing that Victoria would know... a secret about King.
I think I might be able to help you out with that.
Hey, Natalie.
I've been looking for you.
Hey.
so I heard the police caught your mom's murderer.
how did you know that?
my Dad works at the station.
Yeah, he told me.
but it must be a relief, right? To have some closure?
I guess it is, yeah.
it won't bring my mother back.
well, this won't bring her back either, but it'll help keep her memory close.
I can't believe you did this for me.
I don't know what to say.
you don't have to say anything.
you're here early.
no. No, it's me. Victoria.
what's wrong?
would you please resume your normal form?
I need to be sure it's you.
and I need to be cautious who sees me change.
too many close calls lately.
besides...
I thought you preferred this form.
I mean, she is what you want, isn't she?
Victoria, please.
can you just...
what did you find out about them?
Oh, not as much as I would've liked.
but what about their powers?
where did their powers come from?
I'm very close to an answer on that.
I just need to go to where it started for them... to Belem, Brazil.
you're right.
the timing of it all makes perfect sense.
and while I'm away,
I think it'd be wise to bring Stephanie into the fold.
now why would I do that?
I think she's going to be key to the project moving forward, and if you're gonna trust anyone, it's her.
I mean, come on. She was your student. She admires you.
she said she would do absolutely anything for you.
she said that?
I have no doubt that Dr. Powell will be a wonderful addition to your team.
Yes.
I believe you're right.
fuck me, if he knows where we are.
you said it.
at Least he hasn't Led us to the enemy.
guys, we'll wait until the fog Lifts.
lt's too risky to carry on.
with you, even drinking coffee is risky.
what a guide!
you try to do better in this fog!
listen to him! He's always happy.
the eternal optimist.
know the difference between a pessimist and an optimist?
no, what? -A pessimist thinks things can't be worse.
an optimist knows they can.
you and your crap jokes. No one else finds them funny.
lf you had any brains at all, you'd give up.
Oh, yeah? Lf L had any, L wouldn't be here.
l'd be a general or a UN official.
or l'd open a restaurant. What's that Look for?
lt would help my budget if you smoked your own.
since you're offering... _Who the fuck am L? Mother Teresa?
are you crazy?
you want them to see us?
who's going to see us? L can't even see my feet.
put those cigarettes out! Put them out!
hair in place?
he's something else!
first time at the front and he dozes off before we get there.
kids these days...
what?
any idea where we are? -L reckon we should be there by now.
dawn will soon be here and it'll be easier.
l never took a relief squad to the front at night before.
we got Lucky...

what are you doing?
seeing as we have time, Let's have a Little fun.
look at it: "Made in EU."
my Little baby.
what do you think it is?
- - A mine. - - A bouncing mine!
when the enemy steps on it...
...what happens, according to you?
lt explodes. -No, nothing happens.
but when the enemy steps off it, it bounces up...
...and explodes about three feet off the ground...
...spraying out 2, 000 Lead bearings...
...that destroy everything in a radius of 50 yards.
l'll show you.
move this son of a bitch.
gently.
careful with the pin.
lay the body down slowly, otherwise you get blown up.
go on, tug the wire now.
me? Why me?
go on, don't worry, as Long as there's a weight...
do it gently, that's all.
l can't.
chicken!

l invented this.
when they pick up the body the mine will blow them all to hell.
what's your name again? - - Nino.

where does the other one Lead?
I don't know. -You don't know anything?
fuck...
don't touch that! Get back!
how did you get here? _We crawled.
across the field? You're Lying!
I'm not. Your side was blinded by the sun.
_And the mines? _L don't know. He knew.
Where's the map?
what map? -Of Bolivia, stupid. Of the mines!
empty your pockets. -Why?
because I has a gun and you don't. Come on.

_What the hell's that? _Is he ours?
lt's not written on his boxers. Call the officer.
_What do L tell him? -That the dead are walking.

_one of ours? -God knows. He only had boxer shorts on.
any other brilliant ideas?
lf you piss me off, you go back out there.
they've stopped.

how about yours? Do they ever stop?
you can't compare. We didn't start the war.

No! The Khmer Rouge! ALL you can do is make war.
_Us? -No, you're pacifists.
the Great Serbia, all the way to the Pacific!
please. The whole world thinks Like me.

and that's my side shooting now?
you're all saints. Give it a rest.

I haven't seen anything Like what you say.
I've seen it! L saw my village burn.
I don't know. I wasn't there. Was!

your side, probably. They just shot at you, too.
they only shot at me because they didn't recognize me.
lt's useless talking to you.
what the hell made you ruin this beautiful country?
- Us? - Yes!

because you started the war!
_You started it! _What? Who started it?

_We did. _You started the war.
and stop pissing me off. You're getting on my nerves.

maybe you shouldn't smoke today.
everything okay?
you haven't told me your name. My name's Nino.

Arizona 2, stay where you are. I'll talk to my superiors.

Hello, sir. This is Capt. Dubois. -How can L help you?
it's the first time that the two camps are asking me for the same thing...
...and I don't know what to do.
why are you asking me and not your superiors?
they are all in Geneva for a seminar on media relations.
lt seems from your report that these men...
...are stranded between the two front Lines.
but we don't even know if they are soldiers or not. Ls that right?
what do you expect me to do?
l can't risk the Lives of our soldiers in order to save theirs.
do L have to remind you of the precise purpose of our mission here in Bosnia?
since it is the first time that the two camps are
you know perfectly well that there is nothing that L can do...
...without the approval of the General Assembly of the United Nations.
I don't think the General Assembly will convene itself...
...specifically to deal with the problems of two unknown individuals...
...trapped in no man's Land.
there is nothing L can do. I don't have the authority.
what should I tell them, sir?
tell them that, as usual, neither side can agree.

l'd Like to go there. WouLd you go with me?
are you resentfuL that peopLe are taLking whiLe you are suffering?

why don't you teLL them the truth? -Who are you?
l am Jane Livingston, GLobaL News ChanneL...
...and this is Sgt. Marchand, otherwise known as Arizona 2.
stop the engine.
how do you know that? -We were Listening to your radio frequency.
since we were in the area, we thought we'd come and verify.
_You Listened to our radio? -AbsoLuteLy.
lt's the best way to get fresh information.
are you going back? Why do you need a bomb disposaL unit?
stop the camera.
can you take us there? -No, L have to go.
that's right.
you're just here to distribute humanitarian aid.
okay, we'LL go without you. Come on, Let's go.
you can't. Lt's too dangerous.
ls that an order?
okay, stop fiLming, pLease.
please?
Yes, aLL right.
maybe L can heLp you if you'LL heLp me.
we have an EngLish TV crew here.
they know everything.
other crews are on the way. They picked up our frequency.
l didn't answer their questions.
Hello, Captain. This is Jane Livingston of GLobaL News.
l can hear everything you're saying.
are we to assume that the UNPROFOR are doing absoLuteLy nothing...
...for those who are wounded and trapped between the two fronts?
who made this decision? Are headquarters aware of the situation?
you know very well that you have no right to listen or to use this freguency.
get off it immediately or we'll confiscate your press card. Over.
ls that a threat?
listen, Miss livingston, I was not in any way threatening you.
please, try to understand. We are doing what we can.
at this moment we are in negotiations with both camps to arrange a ceasefire.
as you know, the situation is extremely complicated and takes time.
that's a Lie.
can you teLL me where these negotiations are and who's in charge?
l have my second unit on hand here who couLd cover it immediateLy.
I have no more information for the moment.
you're teLLing me that negotiations are taking pLace...
...but you don't know where they are or who's in charge.
at the same time...
...you've requested that your soLdiers who were on the scene return to base.
I just carry out orders.
who issues these orders? Can L have a name?
I cannot disclose military affairs.
first of all, I must reguest authorization from my superiors.
fine, go ahead. L'LL wait right here for your answer.
l'm preparing a news report which goes off in haLf an hour...
...and it wiLL be fascinating to monitor the response...
...of miLLions of our viewers who wiLL watch the show.
thank you, Captain.
Arizona 2, are you still there?
affirmative, CharLie Tango.
stay there until further orders. Over and out.
message received, sir.
_CouLd L__ -No, pLease, not now.
why are you doing this?
l'm sick of being a bystander.
what wouLd you do? _What L'd do?
l'd stop the madmen ruining this country. We have what it takes.
aren't you neutraL?
you can't be neutraL facing murder.
doing nothing to stop it is taking sides.
magnificent. Will you say that on camera?
l may be mad, but L'm not stupid.
_Jane. -Yeah, L'm coming.
l'll be right back.
what's wrong? -My Leg's itching.
wait.
you want to bLow us away? L'LL scratch you.
lower.
again. To the Left.
there. That's good.
l need the toiLet.
piss in your pants.
lt's the other.
lt's okay.
easy for you to say.
here at the Bosnian barricade...
...we do not know if this is yet another mission impossibLe...
...or if, indeed, they wiLL actuaLLy decide to do something.
thank you, Jane.
let's take a look at the history of UN involvement in the Bosnian conflict.
Martha, get me Capt. Dubois, pLease.
he just called, but I told him that you were out.
call him back and tell him I'm here.
you're pushing Bosnia-Herzegovina...
...to follow the same path of horror and suffering...
...as Slovenia and Croatia.
you'll lead Bosnia into hell and this may end up...
...exterminating the Muslim people!
radovan Karadzic didn't wait long to carry out his threat.
bosnian Serb paramilitary forces, largely helped by the Yugoslav army...
...furiously attacked Bosnian cities...
...that were defended only by armed Bosnian civilians...
...and the rest of the police forces loyal to the Bosnian government.
serbs started massive attacks against civilian targets...
...spreading fear and terror and introducing a new term: ethnical cleansing.
the world community finally decided to do something...
...after Serb artillery massacred people waiting in lines for bread.
un Security Council decided to send to Bosnia...
...9, 000 troops supported by the American 6th Fleet.
at the moment when the whole world expected military intervention...
...French President Francois Mitterrand lands in Sarajevo...
...a city that was already under siege.
bosnians received him as a savior, but he had different plans.
after meeting with Radovan Karadzic, he opened Sarajevo airport...
...and started wide-scale humanitarian aid action.
un troops were assigned to protect and follow the UNHCR food convoys...
...without any right to interfere in the conflict.
today, Bosnians are still denied the right to defend themselves...
...By an imposed UN weapon embargo...
...although, at this very moment, war continues without any signs of pacification.
the tragedy of the Bosnian nation continues...
...and the only help they've got now is 120 grams of humanitarian aid per day.
for those joining us now, we have news from Bosnia...
...where some men are caught in no man's land.
our correspondent Jane livingston is there.
we're waiting to see which measure will be taken by UNPROFOR.
is there anything you'd like to add, Jane?
Olivia, I would like to repeat the words that I heard here only moments ago.
neutrality does not exist in the face of murder.
doing nothing to stop it is, in fact, choosing.
it is not being neutral.
thank you, Jane. We'll come back to you later.
that was Jane livingston, live from Bosnia. We'll be back after this.
Martha, gonna need a heLicopter and a map of Bosnia-Herzegovina.
how was it? We haven't had an opportunity Like that in a very Long time.
Yeah.
I know. I just hope it will make them move their asses, you know?
Yeah. That's right.
okay. I'll call you as soon as we get there.
shit! We weren't the onLy ones Listening to the UNPROFOR, obviousLy.
Hi, John.
okay, guys. We have the go-ahead.
stay here whiLe we check things.
come on. That's not what we agreed.
lt's too dangerous now. You can move in with the mine expert.
No! You said that you wouLd take us up...
fucking French.
really, I'm sick of it.
give me the photo in my pocket.
which pocket? -The top one.
this one.
let me see.
why do soLdiers aLways carry photos? _I've no idea. Let me see.
l can't see Like that.
think L'LL see her again? -Cut it out, of course you wiLL.
stop it, for God's sake!
shit!
you stop!
watch the knife!
stop now!
lt's over! You stop! HeLp is coming.
the mining squad is coming. You understand? You teLL him.
the mine squad's coming!
l'll kiLL you for this!
lt's good for you.
help coming.
l'll get reinforcements. Keep an eye on them...
...and cLean his wound.

what's happening? -Okay, you'LL be abLe to fiLm.
are you sure?
everything okay? Are you aLL right?

Sgt. Marchand here is going to brief you now.

whoever wiLL not respect the ruLes...
...will be thrown out and their press card wiLL be confiscated.
go now into your cars. We'LL Leave in a few minutes.
please go.
_You never mentioned a man on a mine. _L didn't?
l forgot. ShaLL we go?
we wait for the mine expert. -He isn't with you?
ours were busy. They're sending a German.
he shouLd be here at 3: 30. Lt's 3: 30 now.
bang on the dot.
what?
capt. Dubois. Do you speak French?
no.
english, of course. _Of course.
_You know the situation? -No, we had no time for a briefing.
we don't have much time, so you foLLow us, L wiLL expLain you.
over there. FoLLow us.
at this very moment the UNPROFOR are trying to heLp the third soLdier...
...who is Lying on a mine.
the absurdity of war continues, taking on a different guise.
how wiLL aLL this end? Stay tuned to GLobaL News.
Jane Livingston, Live from Bosnia.
here.
excuse me...
...can L make interview with you?
go fuck yourseLf! You're the Last thing L need.
fucking BaLkanian. What the fuck are you doing?
l just thought-- _Don't think.
l'm the one who thinks around here.
excuse me, wouLd you Like a cigarette?
do you speak a LittLe EngLish?
_LittLe. -L can do interview with you?
how do you feeL? -Okay.
do you feeL tired? _Yes.
was it you who put the mine underneath the other soldier?
fucking bastard. Cut!
l'll kill him, even if it's the Last thing L do.
what's wrong with you? _I should have killed him.
see that? L spared him and now...
...he's tried to kill me with my own knife!
how do you feel?
great. Couldn't be better.
first, they shoot at me, then L wake up on a mine...
...the whole world's watching me, I need to shit...
...and you piss me off with your stupid stories.
it'll soon be over.
you are okay? -Yes, I'm ready.
now, I need everybody out of the place.
we need the safety parameters at Least 30 meters.
okay. I'll do it.
move everybody out.
okay, please, now, you must go back. We will start de-mining.
Michel, Let's get going!
you must Leave now. De-miner wants everybody out.
you, out.
Yes, he out, too. Later, when we finish. Understand?
they'll bring him out Later.
lf L need a translator, L'LL find one.
let's go.
calm down!
you cannot stay here, okay?
tell him if he stays here we will not start working.
lt's a question of security. Say it to your friend.
he's not my friend.
I know, but please, L have no other translator. Tell him.
they'll do nothing until we go. _L don't need a translator!
go fuck yourself, asshoLe!
keep your cool. Just go.
l'll wait for you up there.
keep an eye on him.
okay?
you can probably just make out behind me, as I'm speaking to you...
...the Serbian soldier, Limping, closely followed by the Bosnian soldier.
these two men, at Least, will be walking to their safety.
but they will be Leaving behind the third soldier...
...who is still patiently waiting on the mine...
...for the bomb-disposal expert to save his Life.
for him, the ordeal is not yet over.
this is Jane Livingston, Live from Bosnia...
...for Global News. Stay tuned.
get Lost!
fuck you!
asshole! I give him bandages and he refuses them.
they're all maniacs!
lt's John here. Are you still there? -Yes. Hello?
okay. Listen, this is really great, but it would be fantastic if you could...
...get the story of the guy on the mine.
I'll try. I mean...
maybe you could get a close-up of him when they're clearing the mine?
Yeah, I'll try.
have you interviewed the other two guys yet?
no, unfortunately they won't let me get anywhere near them.
go get it, Jane. Come on!
as soon as you get it, we'll go Live again. Okay? Good Luck.
thank you.
don't move.
fuck, what a job.
they say a mine expert only ever makes one mistake.
_Two mistakes. _How come?
the first is when he chooses the job.
what is happening?
there's too much stones. L can't approach the mine.
I don't even see what kind of mine it is.
I know. Wait.
ls this the mine that is under the body? _Yeah.
l can do nothing.
_What? -Lt's impossible to de-activate...
...this kind of stuff once the mechanism is on.
this man is already dead.
are you sure? Can't you put something between him and the mine?
maybe another de-miner knows better.
you can call whoever you want.
nobody, nothing in the world can de-mine this stuff, not in these conditions.
at Least L don't know about it.
deus ex machine. He's all we needed.
why are you here? Do you consider it such an important mission?
we consider all our missions to be of the utmost importance.
our job here is to expedite the peace process in this country.
you didn't want to intervene. Lt was your soldiers...
...who were sick and tired of waiting, who initiated the action.
I'm afraid you got the wrong end of the story here.
this is a simple new system of command.
lf it's effective, then the unit in the field will have much greater mobility.
what do you have to say about the Americans' accusations...
...that Europe's incapacity to do anything is due to UNPROFOR's internal problems?
I've heard no such accusations. You must judge for yourself.
the UNPROFOR is perfectly fulfilling its mission. Thank you very much.
what are the relationships between the British and the French?
I think we'll have to deal with that Later. Lt's far too complicated.
thank you. -My pleasure.
how's it going? -We have a problem, sir.
what problem? _One of the soldiers is on a mine.
lt's impossible to defuse it.
what?
the mine disposal expert says it is impossible to defuse it.
this whole fucking business stinks to high heaven, as L said from the start.
lf the journalists get one whiff of this, they'll crucify us.
shit.
what did you decide? What are we going to do?
get back into the trench. Pretend to be busy.
we've got to buy ourselves some time. -Excuse me to repeat
get back into the trench!
that's an order.
captain, what's happening?
the mine disposal expert has begun his job.
you will be informed as soon as he will be finished.
l think it's going to take a Little while. -Can we approach?
unfortunately, for security reasons, L cannot allow that.
you wanted to kill me with my own knife?
Oh, shit.
quick! Tom!
is that how you thank me?
don't come any closer!
you're all the same!
and you vultures film it?
you get good money? Does our misery pay well?
No!
did you get it? _Yes.
captain? Over here, please.
what do you think
take it easy.
listen...
there was no other solution.
Marchland! Put the bodies in the car. We're going.
what's happening? -The mine expert's defused it.
_He has? _Yes.
Colonel, sir, can we just have a few questions?
ladies and gentleman, what can L say? You see the conditions we work under.
our focus now must be on the remaining soldier.
we hope to be able to save at Least one Life.
_Can we come closer? Can we film it? -Eventually.
he's in critical condition and has to be taken to a hospital immediately.
when he's in a fit state to answer your questions, you'll be informed.
the press conference tonight at 22: 00 at the Holiday Lnn...
...at which time I shall be happy to answer any of your questions.
for the time being, I must ask you please to prepare to Leave the field...
...since I can no longer guarantee your safety. Night is beginning to fall.
please, ladies and gentlemen, prepare to go.
thank you.
what's going on? -We took out the mine expert's gear.
_What about him? -Lf you have an idea, Let me know.
_We can't Leave him there! _You have a solution?
you heard the mine expert.
I hope you understand now.
it's not our business, so we stay out of it.
everything all right, Captain? Good work, gentlemen.
I'm very pleased.
I have no doubt that in the fullness of time you'll be duly compensated.
you've got the contact numbers from Dubois?
call them, will you, and notify them that they're dead.
then I'd Like you to notify each side...
...that we have information that the other side...
...is planning to commandeer the central trench this evening.
could you caLL me the Liaison of the Bosnians, please? Thank you.
well, see you round. -See you.
I wanted to thank you.
you got your report. _Yes.
are you okay?
ready to go? -Sorry?
are you ready to go? _Yes.
let's not hang around, Let's go.
I hope we meet again. -I hope so.
remember the press conference tonight, 22: 00, all right?
Yes.
I know what you're thinking, Sergeant.
it wouLdn't make any difference, you know. It wouLdn't change anything.
we need some more over here!
look out, here's Your Majesty. She can smell it when you're not working.
you there! Is the machine mended? - Yeah.
then use it, for there's many to take your place.
the child is ill. Send her home. - I can't afford to.
the child cannot work.
is there another child at home?
if you can get her here within the hour, you can keep the place.
thank you.
in the hour, mind, or lose it.
whatever you think best, Mother.
you know how this mill works almost better than I do.
(MARGARET） You ask me what I miss most about the countryside.
well, Edith, in Milton you cannot feel the seasons change around you but I do think that at long last we have put winter behind us and I can resume my daily walks.
I don't know why you're blaming me. - Play your tricks. If you're wrong, we all suffer.
they wanted 5%. Would you have given it them? - No, but I would have told them straight.
I wouldn't tell them to come back on payday so I could turn them down flat and provoke them.
are you accusing me of encouraging a strike? - Wouldn't it have suited you?
it's our livelihood you're playing with.
you would handle your workers better? - I wouldn't deliberately deceive them. Good day.
here is the address of our doctor.
you did not need to visit in person. You could have sent a servant.
you've been in this heathen climate for some time. I'm surprised you haven't needed a doctor.
we don't. I came here personally because I didn't want to alarm my father.
it's just a precaution, in case.
my mother has low spirits.
Really? We don't have much of that up here.
but Dr Donaldson will try to help if he can.
I'm sorry to disturb you.
you do not disturb me.
but even you, not remotely interested in industry, might know that there is talk of a strike.
not just here, but one that will affect the whole of Milton.
what would they gain by striking?
they'll be wanting higher wages?
that is what they will say.
but the truth is...
that there are some men raise themselves to be masters, while others will always seek to pull them down.
that is the way of the world, Miss Hale, and there is nothing you and I can do about it.
(WOMAN） I need three over here!
Hello, Miss Margaret! Been visiting the old dragon?
Hello, Jenny. How's your mother? - Little better, miss.
do you like working here? - Like it? Like work?
it's the same as anywhere. Well, it's better than Hamper's. You can only earn four shillings there.
I earn five and ten up here but my dad makes me give him most of it.
what would you spend it on, if you could?
food, and then more food. A pile of it, great big plates.
so, would you join a strike?
well, I'm not saying there will be one. Just if there was.
your mother has kindly given me the name of a doctor.
you're ill? - No. No, it's just a precaution.
your mother is always accusing me of knowing nothing about Milton.
doubt she meant you should hang on to their tittle... tattle.
they weren't telling me any secrets.
there was a man with a survey here. It's the new thing.
they become practised at telling others their working conditions.
do you mind that, if they tell the truth? - Of course not.
I don't apologize to anyone about the wages I pay or how I run Marlborough Mills.
it's in plain sight for all to see.
what about how they spend their money?
that would be none of my business.
my duty is to the running of the mill. If I neglect that, all the workers will cease to have an income.
but what about your moral duty?
if she keeps to her hours and does nothing to disrupt the efficient working of the mill, what she does in her own time's not my concern.
here in the North, we value our independence.
but surely you must take an interest?
I'm her employer. I'm not her father or her brother that I can command her to do as I please.
sorry to disappoint you, Miss Hale.
I would like to play the overbearing master but I'll answer your questions as honestly as I'm sure you ask them.
now, if you'll excuse me, I've urgent business.
all the time there she is, looking down on us like a great black angry crow guarding the nest.
as if I would ever consider her son as a suitor!
don't say you haven't thought about it.
mind you, you'd have to get some smarter clothes.
thank you! I'll have you know these were new last year!
not a chance. There's loads of girls after him.
they're welcome to him, with my good wishes.
I can say this. If I ever have a son. I'll not hang on to him like she does.
well, I'll never be having children of any sort, so that won't be a problem.
bessy, is it really so bad?
fluff on me lungs. Won't go away, however much I cough.
at least I won't grow too old and ugly! There is that.
and this happened at Marlborough Mills? - No. No.
must've happened when I were little. We didn't know of these things then. We all had to work.
when Father found out, he moved me straightaway to Thornton's.
he loves you very much, doesn't he? - Yes.
fathers and daughters. Mothers and sons.
so maybe we shouldn't be too hard on old battleaxe Thornton!
maybe your mother would be just the same if she had a son.
she does... have a son.
I have a brother.
why didn't you ever say so before? - Because we don't talk about him.
come on, I could do with a good story.
but he was desperate to go to sea and Father thought it would be the making of him.
he left full of hope...
but that was before he sailed with the Captain.
he was a monster.
once they set sail, he did whatever he liked. He beat the children to within an inch of their lives.
couldn't they do anything? - They tried.
Frederick and the others stood up to him. Some wanted to kill him.
eventually they put the Captain and a few of his officers in a boat and let it loose on the open sea.
the Navy called it a mutiny.
but Frederick really had no choice.
he was branded the "ringleader" and called a "traitor."
(MARGARET） Eventually the Navy printed a list of the mutineers and Fred's name was among them.
it nearly killed my parents.
he was in South America for a few years.
now he lives in Spain, in Cadiz.
Spain! How romantic!
sometimes I think I'll never see him again.
but if it could be told how he were put upon, how he defended others against that mad man, surely the law would spare him.
some of the sailors were caught. They pleaded their case. Captain Reid was clearly insane.
but they were hanged anyway.
no, Frederick's safe in Spain.
but if he comes home he'll be condemned to death, I'm sure.
I suppose you can take comfort that he was so brave and acted to spare those sailors weaker than himself.
Yes, I do.
but I confess that sometimes I wish he'd been more of a coward if it meant my mother might see him once more.
preparations already?
if we're going to entertain, we must do it properly.
you're not regretting the invitations, are you?
no, no. Spend what you will.
though it may have to be the last dinner party we have for some time.
so, who's on the list?
Slicksons of course. Fosters. Browns will decline, but we must invite them all the same.
hales will come, I presume?
they are probably aware of the great advantage it would be to Mr. Hale to be introduced to people.
that would not influence them.
how you seem to understand these Hales, John!
are they so different from any other people we meet?
he seems a worthy kind of man.
rather too simple for trade.
she's a bit of a fine lady, with all her low spirits!
as for the daughter, she gives herself airs.
yet they're not rich and they never have been.
she's not accomplished. She can't play the piano.
what else does she lack to bring her up to your standard?
I heard Miss Hale say she could not play myself, John.
if you would let us alone we might perhaps see her merits and like her.
I'm sure I never could.
I wish you would try to like Miss Hale, Mother.
Why?
you've not formed an attachment to her, have you?
mind you, she'll never have you.
why, she once laughed in my face at the thought of it! I'm sure she did.
she would never have me.
she has too good an opinion of herself to take you.
I should like to know, will she find anyone better?
you can both believe me, then, when I say this out of complete indifference to Miss Hale.
Mr. Hale is my friend. She is his only daughter. I wish you'd both make an effort to befriend her.
I only wish I knew why you talked about her so much. I'm tired of it.
what would you like us to talk about? How about a strike for a more pleasant topic?
(MAN） Now, now listen!
the men up at Hamper's have been told not to expect a rise!
what about Slickson's? - Thornton will tell us Friday!
so, what do you reckon? - Strike!
I thought so.
now is the time. We will all stop our machines at the end of the day Friday, 10 minutes before time!
and no one, no one will start them up!
what if Slick son decides to offer, do anything to keep his mill working at advantage of others?
then you still come out.
remember, if we all refuse to work, we are the strong ones!
how long d'you think the masters will last out? - A week, two weeks at most.
what if they send in for hands from Ireland?
thornton will. He'd die before being dictated to. - I'll take him down!
and any Irishman who takes our wages!
listen! No!
no violence!
masters expect us to behave like animals.
we will show them we are thinking men.
we will not be out... thought.
the only enemy of the strike is ourselves!
now, we must manage this strike well!
not like five years ago, when half of us went back to work before the others.
(MEN） Aye.
is that understood? - Aye.
this is it. We keep together. Friday evening it is!
(MEN） Friday!
are the hands about to turn out?
they're waiting for me to turn down their demands.
are there many orders in hand?
of course. We know that well enough.
the Americans are flooding the market.
our only chance is producing at a lower price and faster.
but the faster we fill the orders, the longer it takes to be paid.
how much are we owed?
the debt to the bank is nearly ￡400.
the men are less patient.
they've barely made up pay since their last cut.
why don't they listen?
they think that just by putting their ignorant heads together they'll get their way.
don't worry, Mother. It's a young industry. These problems will iron themselves out.
we're not yet in the position of selling up.
can't you get men from Ireland? Then you can get rid of the strikers.
I would. I'd teach them I was master and could employ who I like.
Yes, I can. And I will too, if the strike lasts.
it'll be trouble and expense but I will do it rather than give in.
if there is to be this extra expense,
I'm sorry we're giving the dinner this year.
we should go on as before.
no more, no less.
there, now, Mother. Surely one of these will do for the Thornton's...
excuse me. - Ah, and this is Margaret, of course.
the last time I saw you, you were eight, running round Helstone with your brother.
Mr. Bell! Of course!
how do you do?
I thought that she would grow into a handsome young woman, but this goddess I never imagined.
Margaret will not understand your humor.
no offence, my dear. - Of course not.
I am pleased you've come to visit at last.
with this talk of strikes, I thought I'd check with my banker whether I should sell up my property.
surely not. We're not even certain there'll be a strike, are we, Father?
I don't know. Seems to me that masters and workers will never see eye to eye.
in my teaching capacity, I meet many a working man.
they have some dreadful tales and speak from the heart and have arguments for the strike which appear entirely logical.
you know, they suffered a pay cut five years ago and have never got back to those wages.
no, though the price of food goes up all the time.
but then our friend Thornton comes to read and he answers my questions and puts the other side so eloquently...
I truly don't know what to think.
I'm sure Mr. Thornton does put his own view very eloquently.
I'm surprised the Thornton's are having a dinner, with trouble looming.
the Thornton's have a dinner on exactly the same date every year.
time nor tide stops for Mrs. Thornton's dinners.
she does not turn back for any man. - Now, that is very true!
Margaret's made friends amongst the workers. - Really?
extraordinary girl.
they've said no? - We were expecting it.
when you were asking what color would suit the baby best.
I do so long to see him.
I'm sure he'll look splendid in whatever you choose.
I've been very busy.
it's strange, for the rest of Milton is not at work.
the mills have been dark for some weeks and the streets are strangely quiet.
people try to scrape what living they can.
but all around there is desperation.
both workers and masters are holding fast to their positions. Neither will give way.
no one can say how long the strike will last.
(MAN） No! My wife! No!
she can't stand the sight of her little 'uns starving.
she'll be dead before we get our five per cent!
I hate you! You and the whole pack of the union!
said it'd take two weeks.
two weeks, you said.
it's been twice as long as that and my little 'uns are lying in their beds too hungry to cry.
don't.
now, I told you I would take care of you...
and I pledge my heart and soul that we will win.
you expect a man to watch his children starve 'ere he dare go against the union.
you've no more pity for a man than a pack of hungry wolves.
(MARGARET） We do what little we can.
I feel guilty that we do not go hungry, and helpless in the face of so much suffering.
she's a bit down in the mouth today. The strike's been going on too long.
do you blame me?
what about the Boucher's? - I left a basket outside the door.
he's got less spirit than Father and more mouths to feed.
the master'll try anything to get them back. How are you gonna stop 'em going to work?
we'll be persuasive.
where I come from in the South if the field labourers strike, the seed would not be sown and there'd be no harvest.
so? - What would become of the farms?
the farmers would have to give them up or maybe they could pay a fair wage!
suppose they couldn't, even if they wished to?
then they'd have no corn to sell and no wages to pay the next year.
I don't know about the South! I've heard there are a lot of inspirited, downtrodden men.
I'm sure I'm very ignorant. But surely not all the masters would withhold pay with no reason.
you're a foreigner. You know nothing.
to hell with Thornton's, Slickson's, Hamper's.
to hell with the lot of them.
is Mr. Thornton really as bad as the rest? - He's a fighter, fierce as a bulldog.
he's better... looking, surely, than a bulldog?
he'll stick to his word like a dog.
he's worth fighting with. That's the best I'll say for him.
I'll not argue with you, miss.
see you later, lass.
he doesn't mean to shout. They're all nerves at the minute.
Where's he going? - Golden Dragon.
he has a pint pot to... calm himself sometimes.
he talks so certain, but he's worried about keeping the strike together.
there's a lot of men, and not all of them have the same discipline as Father.
Ah, Mrs. Thornton!
I hope it is silent enough for you tonight, Mr. Hale.
the men have been gracious enough to turn out for the last month so all is quiet for our dinner party.
I'm sorry that your mother is ill.
it's nothing serious, I'm sure. She is just a little tired.
I wonder if she might like to try the water mattress.
it's the very latest thing, a mattress that fills with water.
gives great comfort to the back.
have you been ill, Miss Thornton? - Oh, no, no. I am very delicate.
I send off for the latest inventions, just in case.
mother doesn't approve.
(MAN） Ah, Thornton, good evening.
Slickson, good evening. Henderson. Watson.
Thornton. I took the liberty of inviting myself, knowing your mother's hospitality.
I hope you're not worrying about Marlborough Mills. We'll ride out the strike as we always have.
I've always had faith in you, but this situation... - It's nothing I can't handle.
no, of course not. Thornton knows everything in matters of business. He has my every confidence.
Thornton, you know Miss Latimer?
Thornton, who's that fine young lady?
see, I am learning Milton ways, Mr. Thornton.
I am sorry your mother was unable to join us.
Thornton, I must speak with you.
excuse me.
have you left word at the barracks? - It's been done.
men on horseback, armed? - All those arrangements have been made.
if they find out you are planning to break the strike...
I take this risk for myself. You need not join in.
I can and will protect myself and anyone that works for me from any kind of violence.
I sincerely hope so.
thornton is most ungallant this evening, leaving the most glorious woman in the room to talk to that slimy eel Slickson.
now, then, who can we introduce you to? Come with me.
I hear Arnold is moving, lock, stock and barrel, to America.
America? I'll be damned.
that's what I'd like to do, pack up and leave. The damn strikers'd have no work at all then.
they have no work at the moment.
there is work. They choose not to do it.
Thornton? What do you think?
I think our Mr. Bell is up to his old tricks, playing with words at the expense of us simpler fellows.
but it's a serious question.
I don't want to manufacture in another country but it's logical for others to try if they cannot make a profit here.
what do you think, Miss Hale? Surely you don't condone the strikers.
well, no. And yes. It is surely good to try to see both sides of a question.
Mrs. Arthur saw you taking a basket to the Princeton district the other afternoon.
I have a good friend in Princeton. Her name is Bessy Higgins.
Higgins? Isn't he one of your union leaders, Hamper?
Yeah. He's a terrific firebrand. A dangerous man.
I'm surprised, Miss Hale, you keep such company.
Bessy is my friend. Nicholas is a little... - Nicholas? She's on first... name terms?
well, Mr. Higgins has been made a little wild by circumstances.
but he speaks from his heart, I'm sure.
if he's so determined, I'm surprised he'll accept charity.
well, he doesn't for himself. The basket was for a man whose six children are starving.
Ah, well. Then he knows what to do. Go back to work.
I believe this poor starving fellow works at Marlborough Mills, doesn't he, Margaret?
you do the man, whoever he is, more harm than good with your basket.
you could say the longer you support the strikers, the more you prolong the strike.
that is not kindness.
they will be defeated but it will take longer. Their pain will be prolonged.
but surely to give a dying baby food is not just a question of logic?
Mrs. Thornton, I really must congratulate you on these magnificent...
um, table settings.
I don't believe I've seen finer table decorations even in the grandest gatherings in Harley Street.
not all masters are the same, Mr. Bell.
you do us an injustice to always think we're all up to some underhand scheme or other.
do come in. Maria may still be up.
Margaret?
who was that, Dixon?
who? - The man I saw leaving the house.
what man? - Dixon.
it was the doctor. Dr. Donaldson.
mother? - He was making his usual visit.
his usual visit? How long has he been coming here?
Margaret...!
why are you hiding over there?
Oh, now, now! What's this?
Dixon told you, didn't she?
she promised she wouldn't. - I made her.
it was Dixon who said that you shouldn't be told.
what does Dixon know?
she's a servant. I'm your daughter!
Shh. I don't want your father to hear.
don't be angry with Dixon.
she loves me.
no. I'll try not to.
I keep thinking about Helstone.
I used to complain about it sometimes and want to leave.
and now I'll never see it again.
that's my punishment.
and, Margaret...
I can't stop thinking about Frederick.
I'll never see him again either!
Oh, Margaret, it's so hard!
there, there, now. Shh, shh.
dear, dear, dear!
there, now, miss. You would know! Now you'll fret before you need to.
likely tell the master too. Then I'll have the whole house to deal with.
no, I won't tell Father.
I can bear it better than him. - So I see!
I've known for some time now how ill she is.
and, though I don't pretend to love her as you do,
I've loved her better than anyone else in the whole world.
I'll never forget the first time I saw her.
the young Miss Beresford.
I broke a needle into my finger, I was so nervous...
and she bound my hand with her own handkerchief.
and then...
when she returned from the ball...
she remembered to look in on me.
she changed the handkerchief for another one.
she was the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen or seen since.
now, miss, you'd best get to bed!
you're gonna need a clear mind in the morning.
I'm sorry I get cross with you, Dixon.
Oh, bless you. I like a bit of spirit!
when you're all fired up, you remind me of Master Frederick.
that is a welcome sight.
you'll take us to the factory in the morning, sir?
that's the lot for tonight. We can't risk bringing any more in before daylight.
(IRISHMAN） Come on, O'Neil! Keep up, now!
Oh, it's you, miss.
did you see anyone in the street? - No. That's very odd, isn't it?
where is everyone? - I think we'll know soon enough.
best get inside the house, miss, and bolt the door behind you.
mama will be here in a moment. She asked me to apologise.
did I see faces in the mill?
my brother has imported hands from Ireland. They're huddled up in the top room.
what are they doing there? - They're frightened.
the strikers have frightened them so that they don't dare work and we don't dare let them out.
mama is seeing to their food and John is trying to calm them down.
some of the women are wailing and begging to go back home.
Ah, here's Mama.
excuse me, I'm sorry to bother you at such a time.
my mother... Fanny mentioned you had a water mattress that we might borrow?
I am sorry, I thought...
(MAN） Thornton!
Thornton!
push it down!
they're coming! They're coming! They'll kill us all!
keep her here at the back of the house. - How soon can the soldiers be here?
try to stop her panicking. - Miss Hale!
miss Hale, I am sorry you have visited us at this unfortunate moment.
they're in there somewhere! Go on!
go on, lads! We'll find 'em!
(WOMAN） It's not right! I've a family to feed!
get the Irish out!
Oh, my God! They're going for the mill door!
get the Irish out!
Oh, no! It's Boucher!
let 'em yell. Keep up your courage for a few minutes longer.
I'm not afraid. Can't you pacify them? - The soldiers will make them see reason.
reason? What kind of reason?
go down this instant and face them like a man. Speak to them as if they were human beings.
they're driven mad with hunger. Their children are starving. They don't know what they're doing.
go and save your innocent Irishmen.
Mr. Thornton, take care!
in God's name, stop! Think of what you're doing! He is only one man and you are many!
go home. The soldiers are coming.
go in peace. You shall have an answer to your complaints.
will you send the Irish home? - Never!
go inside! - They will not hurt a woman.
go inside or I will take you in!
are you satisfied?
kill me if that's what you want!
is she dead? - No, she's breathing but she looks very bad.
where is Mother? We need a doctor.
she had to get through the rioters. She were the only one of us brave enough to go.
did you see? - What?
miss Hale. What happened down below.
did you see Miss Hale clinging to the master? - No.
did all the servants see? - We had a good view from top window.
mama's sure she's set her mind on John. This proves it.
Oh, quick, Jane! Fetch some water!
there, there... Miss Hale! You lie quietly.
mother's gone for the doctor. He will be here soon!
I don't need a doctor. I must go home.
no, you can't! Mother, thank goodness you're back! Miss Hale...
is she worse? - No, I'm quite well. I want to go home.
mm, looks worse than it is.
but you've had quite a blow, young lady.
you'd better rest here a while. - No, you know my mother is unwell.
she must not be alarmed. If she hears of this... I will go now.
surely not, doctor? - I think she must be allowed to do as she will.
I'll take her with me in the carriage, see she reaches home safely.
the streets are still very noisy.
very well.
this way!
Mr. Thornton?
don't worry, sir. We'll catch the ringleaders.
Thornton's come up smiling again. Those hoodlums have broken the strike.
didn't even have to use his Irishmen.
Margaret, is that you?
Yes, Mother. I... I'll be in soon.
I must wash. The streets are very dusty today.
where is Miss Hale?
she has gone home.
gone home? That is not possible.
really, John, she was quite well!
she took a terrible blow. What were you thinking of?
everything was done properly.
Dr. Donaldson was called. I went for him myself as no one else seemed to have a mind to go.
thank you. The streets were dangerous. You...
I'm sure it's not possible to keep a headstrong young woman anywhere she doesn't care to be.
she's such a reckless young woman.
Jane, have you nothing to be getting on with? - Miss Fanny, sir...
I was so scared! I almost fainted! I thought they would break down the door and murder us all!
(MRS THORNTON） Fanny, don't be so ridiculous. - You were in no danger.
where are you going?
to see if Miss Hale is well.
I sent her home in a carriage with Dr. Donaldson. Everything was done properly. John!
I'm asking you not to go.
I hear there's been... some violence up at Marlborough Mills.
I do hope there's not too much damage.
there's a young lady wants Miss Margaret.
I told her to go but she's very distressed. Said her name's Mary.
I'm sorry, miss! I didn't know what to do! Bessy's been took so very ill!
still up?
I thought you'd be exhausted. - Why should I be?
where have you been?
just walking.
where have you been walking?
I promised you I would not go there and I did not.
But?
but...
you know I will have to go there tomorrow and you know what I will have to say.
Yes.
you could hardly do otherwise.
what do you mean?
I mean that you are bound in honour as she has shown her feelings for all the world to see.
her feelings? - She rushed out in front of them and saved you.
or are you telling me I imagined that?
you think none of the servants saw it?
do you think it's not become the tittle... tattle of Milton?
she did save me.
but, Mother, I daren't believe such a woman could care for me.
don't be so foolish.
what more proof do you need, that she should act in such a shameless way?
I'm sure she will take you from me.
that is why I didn't want you to go to see her today.
I wanted one last evening of being the first in your affections.
I will have to change the initials on our linen.
they will bear her name now, hers and yours.
I know she does not care for me.
but I can't remain silent. I must ask her.
don't be afraid, John.
she has admitted it to the world.
I may yet even learn to like her for it.
it must have taken a great deal to overcome her pride.
(EDITH） Dear Margaret, if only uncle would bring you all home you wouldn't need to witness such suffering.
as for feeling guilty, Margaret, surely you can have nothing to reproach yourself for.
after all, the workers chose to go on strike and I am sure you've done your best to help.
even when we were little girls you always did the right thing.
I had not noticed the colour of this fruit.
I'm afraid I was very ungrateful yesterday.
you have nothing to be grateful for. - I think that I do.
I did only the least that anyone would have. - That can't be true.
I was, after all, responsible for placing you in danger.
I would have done the same for any man there.
any man? So you approve of that violence? You think I got what I deserved?
no, of course not! But they were desperate. I know if you were to talk to them...
I forgot. You imagine them to be your friends.
but if you were to be reasonable... - Me? Are you saying that I'm unreasonable?
if you would talk with them and not set the soldiers on them, I know they would...
they will get what they deserve.
miss Hale, I didn't just come here to thank you.
I came because...
I think it very likely... I know I've never found myself in this position before.
it's difficult to find the words.
miss Hale, my feelings for you are very strong.
please, stop.
please don't go any further.
excuse me?
please don't continue in that way. It's not the way of a gentleman.
I'm well aware that in your eyes at least I'm not a gentleman.
but I think I deserve to know why I am offensive.
you speak to me as if it were your duty to rescue my reputation!
I spoke to you about my feelings because I love you. I have no thought for your reputation.
you think that because you are rich and my father is in reduced circumstances that you can have me for your possession?
I should expect no less from someone in trade! - I wish to marry you because I love you!
you shouldn't, because I do not like you and never have.
one minute we talk of the colour of fruit...
the next of love.
how does that happen?
my friend Bessy Higgins is dying.
and that, of course, is my fault, too?
I'm sorry. - For what?
that you find my feelings for you offensive?
or that you assume I'm only capable of thinking in terms of buying and selling?
or enjoy sending my employees to an early grave?
No! No, of course not.
I... I'm sorry to be so blunt.
I have not learnt how to... how to refuse.
how to respond when a man talks to me as you just have.
there are others?
this happens to you every day?
you must have to disappoint so many men that offer you their heart.
please understand, Mr. Thornton... - I do understand.
I understand you completely.
go on! Get out and don't come back!
go on! Go on!
and don't show your face in here again!
(MARGARET） Although the autumn is turning chilly,
I am still determined to take my daily walk.
I cannot persuade Father to join me. He has been very cast down since Mother's death.
he keeps to the house and his own company and he has very few visitors to disturb him.
that man Higgins is here. -- Show him up, Dixon.
if you saw his shoes you'd say the kitchen were a better place!
he can wipe them, surely.
I've been looking for work.
been keeping a civil tongue in my head and not minding who says what back to me.
I'm doing it for him, of course, not me.
Boucher.
well, not for him. He doesn't need my help where he is, but his children.
but I need your help, Master, if you'll give it. -- Gladly. But what can I do?
well, Miss here has often talked about the South. I don't know how far it is.
but if I can get down there, where food is cheap and wages are good and people are friendly...
maybe you can help me get work there.
what kind of work? -- I'm good with a spade.
you mustn't leave Milton for the South.
you couldn't bear the dullness of life. It would eat away at you like rust.
think no more of it, Nicholas, I beg you!
Nicholas, have you been to Marlborough Mills for work?
(SNORTS） Aye, I've been to Thornton's.
the overlooker told me to be off and...told me to go away, sharpish.
would you try again? I...I should be so glad if you would.
mr Thornton would judge you fairly, I am sure, if given the chance.
it would take my pride.
I think I'd rather starve.
if you can think of anything, Master. -- Well, of course, of course.
thank you. I'll bid you goodnight.
I am sorry, Nicholas.
you'll find your shoes by the fire.
he is a proud man.
still, there are qualities to be admired in these Milton men.
Maybe...God has found His way here after all.
if only he and Mr Thornton could speak man to man!
if he could forget Mr Thornton is a master and appeal to his heart!
my word, Margaret!
to admit that the South has its faults and that Mr Thornton has his virtues!
what has happened to bring about such a transformation?
Mrs Thornton. Thank you for sparing the time to visit us.
my father is detained but he'd be touched by your kindness.
thank you for your kind messages. We're so grateful.
my aunt has sent me details of a little Italian tune that Miss Thornton asked me about.
miss Hale. I'm afraid I did not visit to indulge Fanny's thirst for light music.
I have a duty to perform.
I promised your mother that if I knew you had acted wrongly I would offer you advice, whether you chose to take it or not.
so, when I learned from one of my servants that you had been seen out after dark with a gentleman
I thought it right to...to warn you against such impropriety!
many a young woman has lost her character... -- Mrs Thornton!
I'm sure my mother never meant me to be...exposed to insult.
whatever Mr Thornton has told you...
my son has told me nothing.
you know nothing of the man you rejected.
if he has any knowledge of this, he keeps it to himself as any man of honour would.
of course.
I don't doubt it.
I cannot give you any sort of explanation.
I have done wrong but not in the way you imagine or imply.
I did not approve of my son's attachment to you. You did not seem worthy to me.
but I was prepared, for his sake.
your behaviour on the day of the riots exposed you to the comments of servants.
but by the time my son had proposed you'd changed your mind.
maybe this other lover... -- You must think very little of me, madam.
I can't claim to be sorry you refused my son.
no, I'm glad. Especially now, when you expose yourself to gossip and ridicule.
I won't listen to you any more. I refuse to answer your questions. Excuse me.
I need to talk to you, sir. -- I can't stop now.
you've seen the new figures? -- I'd hoped to reduce the bank loan by now.
it's a pity so much is tied up in the new machinery.
I needed the machinery. We were doing well.
we had large orders. I needed the cotton in bulk.
I expected to be able to fulfil the contracts. -- You've been back to work for a good while now.
but we're still behind with the orders and we'll not catch up for...
it's not looking like we will catch up.
well, the bank can extend the loan. Temporarily. But we'll have to be careful.
I don't think anyone has ever accused me of being careless! Or frivolous!
forgive me.
I don't know how I could have prevented this or what to do next.
well, there are more...modern financial procedures.
investments. -- (BALL CLuNKS）
I could let you know when I hear of any such schemes.
speculation?
I'll not risk everything on some idiot money scheme.
well, if matters carry on like this you might not have anything left to risk.
sir?
good Lord! Are you still here? -- Yes, sir. I want to speak to you.
you'd better come in, then.
what do you want with me? -- My name is Higgins.
I know who you are. What do you want? -- I want work.
work? You've got a nerve.
Hamper'll tell you I'm a good worker. -- I'm not sure you'd like what he says about you.
I've had to turn away 100 of my best hands for following you and your union.
and you think I should take you on? Might as well set fire to the cotton waste and have done with it.
I'd not speak against you.
if I found anything wrong I'd give you fair warning before taking action.
I'm a steady man. I work hard.
how do I know you're not just planning mischief or you're saving up money against another strike?
I need work, for the family of a man who were driven mad.
he had his job taken by one of those Irishmen you hired.
your union forced me into hiring those Irish.
much good it did me! Most of them have gone home.
if I were to believe your reason...
I can't say that I'm inclined to. I'd advise you to try some other work and leave Milton.
if it were warmer I'd take Paddy's work and not come back. But come winter the children'll starve.
if you knew of any place away from mills... I'd take any wage for the sake of those children.
what, you'd take wages less than others?
they have no union, of course.
your union'd judge my Irish for trying to feed their families, yet you'd do this for these children.
I'll not give you work. You're wasting your time.
and yours.
I was told to ask you by a woman. Thought you had a kindness about you.
she was mistaken, but I'm not the first to be misled by a woman.
tell her to mind her own business next time.
how long has he been waiting to speak to me?
he was outside the gate when I arrived, sir, and it's four now.
Oh! Miss Hale!
I must congratulate you. -- Yes, we are to be married soon!
delighted to see you again, Miss Hale.
you must hurry, Miss Hale, for my dear girl is busy buying up the whole shop.
he is a little grey, but he's very well set up.
he's a very good match for us Thorntons.
he's been trying to interest John in a speculation.
speculation?
excuse me, I just didn't think that Mr Thornton would participate in any kind of risky venture.
everybody does it!
all business is risk, as my Watson would say.
John will have to be more modern in his ideas if he's to keep up.
No! You must send the bills to Marlborough Mills. You must not pay for a button.
we are quite rich enough!
Honestly!
miss Hale could do with having just a little humility about her position.
she was at Green's. Stopped to congratulate me. She seemed surprised about my wedding plans.
she's so grave and disapproving, as if we couldn't afford it. I soon put her right.
it's not as if she will ever get a husband.
she's much older than me. And so severe!
I told her about Watson's business proposition and she really turned up her nose at me!
she as much as said you wouldn't be interested, as if she knew you better than me. So superior.
I'll thank you not to discuss my business affairs in the street.
what do you know about anything except how to spend money?
if you were to take up Watson's offer and join him in the speculation, you would be certain to profit!
there is nothing certain about speculation.
I will not risk the livelihoods of my men by joining Watson's tomfool schemes.
if I lose money, how will I be expected to pay off the expense of your wedding?
you'll be sorry.
is the speculation so risky?
do you need to ask me that, Mother? It's very risky.
if it succeeds, our financial problems will be over and no one will ever know how bad things are.
if it fails?
at the moment the payroll is safe. Would you advise me to risk it?
if you succeeded, they'd never know. -- And if it fails, I would have injured others.
would you ask me to risk that?
tell me what to do.
pray for a good summer. People will buy cotton clothes.
pray that some of our buyers pay their bills on time...
.and pray that Fanny doesn't have time to order any more from the draper's.
she is in g--great...
are these your children? -- No, but they're mine now.
did your daughter teach them to read? -- I think they are teaching her.
and these are the children you mentioned? -- You didn't believe me?
I spoke to you in a way that I had no business to.
I did not believe you. I couldn't have taken care of a man such as Boucher's children.
I have made enquiries and I know now that you spoke the truth. I beg your pardon.
he's dead and I am sorry. But that's the end of it.
will you take work with me?
you've called me impudent, a liar, a mischief--maker.
for these children, you think we could get along?
well, it's not my proposal that we get on well together.
work is work. I'll come. And what's more, I'll thank you. And that's a good deal from me.
and this is a good deal from me.
now, mind you come sharp to your time. What times we have, we keep sharp.
and the first time I catch you using that brain of yours to make trouble, off you go.
now you know where you are. -- Reckon I'll leave my brains at home, then.
was Miss Hale the woman that told you to come to me?
you might have said. -- And you'd have been a bit more civil?
well, my father is waiting in the sitting--room.
I thought you might like to know that I have taken Higgins on.
I am glad of it.
I didn't know that it was you who urged him to come to me.
would it have made you more or less likely to give him a job?
I don't know.
I'll not withdraw it, if that's what worries you.
I wouldn't think you capable of that.
I have a better opinion of you than you do of me at the moment, I feel.
Margaret, my dear, you're not obliged to answer this question but...
do you have any reason for thinking that Mr Thornton cared for you?
father, I'm sorry.
You...rejected him?
I should have told you. -- Oh, no, no, no.
it would account for him not coming so often to the house.
and I do value his company and conversation especially now...now your mother's gone.
but...
.if you feel uncomfortable in his presence I'll ask him not to come to the house again.
I mean, I'm sure you were honest with him. That's the most important thing.
I've done nothing that I wouldn't do again.
thank you. I needed that.
you're becoming a model employee.
maybe someone will tell the union.
I always kept to my time. Ask anybody.
no, I'll not give Thornton the chance to give me the sack.
puts in all hours himself. Sometimes I don't think he sleeps.
he's taken an interest in young Tom, saying he's got to have a good education.
he's a funny one. I can't make him out.
now you will be drummed out of the union for thinking not so badly about a master!
Laugh...at me.
what are you doing here? Where's Higgins?
have you had your supper?
Mary went to the butcher but she didn't do dinner.
why are you so late? Shift finished an hour ago.
what are you up to?
work wasn't finished. We stayed until it was.
can't pay over your time. -- See you working over your time.
you go under, no one else'll take me on, and who'll put food in his mouth?
he's not had his supper, he's been telling me.
some days there's good meat, other days nothing fit for a dog even if you've got money in your pocket.
there's your market forces in action, Master.
it's a pity you can't get up some scheme.
buy food wholesale, cook for twenty instead of one.
everybody'd be able to afford a good meal a day and you'd have fit minds to do studying.
careful, someone will report you to the masters union for that kind of talk.
if men eat well, they work well.
that'll please masters too, unless they're idiots. Which some of them are.
we'd need somewhere to cook.
there's an old outhouse out the back, not in any use.
you did bring your brains with you to work. -- Well, I can't do without them altogether.
you get some figures up and we'll see.
not promising, mind.
(EDITH） Sholto cries that he cannot remember what his Aunt Margaret looks like.
it's freezing in London. I can't wait for spring.
you must have icicles on your noses in Milton!
it must be even more arctic up there.
couldn't you try to brave the journey and visit us soon? And persuade uncle to come with you.
master?
will you come in? It's stew today. -- I haven't had that for a while.
not eaten all day, I'll bet. -- No, no, been too busy.
this is very good.
really. Very good.
isn't that your daughter? -- Aye. She's a good girl.
a fair cook.
she's come into her own since her sister died, God rest her soul.
congratulations, Mrs Thornton. A very good match, I'm sure.
I haven't seen Mr Thornton for some time.
the winter's been going on so I do hope he isn't sickening.
my son works hard, Mr Hale. He's never ill.
(BELL） Isn't that Mr Latimer's daughter?
it's from Mr Bell. There's to be a reunion of all my Oxford friends.
this time you will accept his invitation? -- I think I will.
I can give my pupils a holiday for a few weeks and now that Thornton's stopped coming...
I'm worried about him.
Why? Is Marlborough Mills really in danger? -- Yes, I'm afraid it is.
but it's his spirit I fear for.
remember, after his father...died he struggled for years to build everything up again.
he raised his family from poverty.
how much worse to be brought low a second time.
I know what it is to disappoint one's family.
he will feel bitterly he's failed his mother. -- He will not have failed in her eyes.
now it's my turn to leave you.
I'm a little nervous, to tell you the truth. -- Don't worry, Father.
it's natural to wonder whether a place where you were so happy so many years ago...
.whether Oxford will be the same.
but once you're there with Mr Bell you'll have a wonderful time.
wrap up warm. It's still very chilly.
it's to Margaret, of course. She's my main concern now.
I worry.
I worry about her...when I'm gone.
Oh, come, come! That won't be for a while.
anyway, I'm her guardian. I've got no one else to look after.
when the time comes, have no fear. She shall want for nothing.
you care for her better than I have.
nonsense! I thought you'd put all that talk behind you.
you know, these last few weeks have done you good. You look years younger.
Yes, I feel it. I feel as though...
.I have come home.
I must tell Margaret.
mr Hale? Dead? -- Aye, in his sleep.
poor fellow. Never recovered from his wife's death.
master? Master, come in.
sit down. Have some food.
and Margaret? What of her?
there's nothing to keep her here now. Her aunt's coming to take her home, they say.
she's seen a great deal of sorrow since she's been here.
we'll be sorry to see her go, Mary and I.
Oh, my dear! How you have suffered!
and what sorrows your father's brought you!
we are leaving instantly.
Dixon, you're to stay here for the time being and arrange an auction for all this.
not all the books. I must say goodbye to our friends.
I can't imagine how many friends you can have here!
I will help you say goodbye and then we are leaving this horrible place for good!
I am sorry that you're leaving, Miss Hale.
I was hoping that you might visit my house.
I've finished it with Indian wallpaper from the Exhibition. I don't suppose you could travel back?
miss Hale will be in no mood for travelling back from London just to see your furnishings, Fanny.
it was a while ago, but I'm sorry for the way I spoke to you at our last meeting.
I know that you meant well.
so, you're going.
I...brought you Father's Plato.
I thought that you might like it.
I shall treasure it.
as I will your father's memory. He was a good friend to me.
so you are going.
and never come back?
I wish you well, Mr Thornton.
I must get her home as soon as possible.
to be sure. As soon as possible.
look back.
look back at me.
(MARGARET） Nicholas! Nicholas! Stop the cab!
Margaret, there you are! We thought you'd gone.
we were going to the station to try and catch you. Can't believe you'd leave without saying goodbye!
we would've come to London next Whitsun rather than you go without a farewell from friends.
Oh, no, Margaret. No, not between friends.
no, not for you, Nicholas. For the children. You can't refuse it for the children.
you'll let me know how they do.
I don't know when she's going to cheer up.
it's been three months now and she's still insisting on wearing black.
Henry, I'm counting on you.
you know how much Captain Lennox and I would like the two of you to get together.
mind you, she's terribly good with Sholto.
I should hate to lose her.
perhaps we could all live together in one big house.
mr Bell arrives today. Maybe he can make her smile.
mr Bell, do you really mean it? -- Of course!
I was sitting on the train thinking, " How could we amuse ourselves? " We should visit Helstone.
when can we go? Tomorrow?
we had to make some improvements.
well, alterations.
we have seven children. -- Yes, of course.
it's just...it's a pity the roses are gone.
the children must have a place to play. Fresh air prepares the mind for God.
better than all that book--reading, that's what I say.
precisely my very words. We have to get back to simple truth.
forget about all this intellectualism, this questioning.
This...dissenting? Like my father? Is that what you mean?
well, no! Well, yes.
I thought we ought to keep things simple.
ignorant? uneducated? Is that what you mean? I'm sure the world would be a better place!
miss Hale has been in the North, where life is a little more...
well, more wild.
(bell CHIMES） -- Why are you smiling?
I was thinking of Mrs Thornton, of how she'd love to be called wild!
Oh, dear! I nearly lost my temper.
Yes, I'm afraid this trip has not gone as I'd wished. I'm sorry.
when we first arrived in Milton I was guilty of romanticising the South.
I've got to work hard at not doing the opposite.
no, I can't have this! Mrs Thornton being wild is bad enough. But romantic? No, no.
you wouldn't call Milton romantic in any way at all, surely?
mr Bell.
when Mother was dying, Frederick came to Milton. We were very secret.
you know why. He left before the funeral.
I went with him to the station and we were seen.
by Mr Thornton. -- I see.
Ah.
you were seen embracing at the station late at night. I see.
no, no. That...that's not the worst of it.
a man approached Frederick, someone that knew him.
he fell and died later.
someone had seen me and I... had to lie to the police inspector.
well, Frederick didn't cause this man's death?
no, no. I...I lied.
I was worried because he was still in the country.
I lied and...and Mr Thornton knows it.
is Frederick safe now?
Yes. Yes, he's married now. Settled down in Cadiz.
sometimes I think I'll never see him again.
but that's not why you're upset?
no, it's just...
I hate to think...
I hate to think Mr Thornton thinks badly of me.
are you sure that's all?
I thought it was going to be such a lovely day.
look. Perhaps I could have a word with Thornton, though I'm afraid he doesn't think much of me.
Oh, no, no. I don't want him to know about Fred.
I do sometimes wish he knew, but don't say anything. Please.
I don't know what I want.
very well. Let us think of other things.
you know, Margaret,
I had an idea when your father died of... looking after you.
you have. You are.
no, you don't quite understand.
I rather hoped you would wish to look after me as well.
I never thought to have a wife.
too busy being an Oxford academic.
anyway, I hoped. Oh, but that doesn't matter. I promised your father I would take care of you.
now, I often think how depressing it would be if one were to leave one's fortune to people who were waiting around hoping you would die off.
so, I mean to sign over the bulk of my monies and property to you now.
no, I can't. I will not! -- Yes, you will.
I am going back to South America to live out the rest of my life in perfect peace and prosperity, knowing you are putting my money to good use.
I couldn't. What about you?
well, something I've been trying to ignore.
my trip to London was not just to see you, my dear. I...saw my doctor.
Oh, shh.
you must think of me living the life under the Argentine skies.
not many men can plan their exit from this world in such a leisurely way.
come now, we must cheer up.
if we go now we'll be in London in time for dinner.
now, I'm in very great need of good food.
so, I'm almost at the end of sorting my business affairs.
when do you sail? -- On Wednesday.
I shall be pleased to be warmed by the sun again. I spent much of my youth there.
Yes, I have signed all my property and fortune to my goddaughter Miss Hale.
I have no other family and Hale is my oldest friend.
south America. Won't you need money to live on?
Oh, I have sufficient for a very good life there. What remains of it.
I am sorry. -- Thank you, but don't be.
I consider myself lucky to be able to settle my own affairs.
to know that Miss Hale is secure will ease my heart in these last few months.
by the way, Miss Hale is unlikely to bother you or to interfere. She is landlord in name only.
even if Miss Hale were minded to interfere, she has little enough opinion of me.
there may not be much left for her to interfere with.
I'm sorry. There is nothing more I can do.
I have left business behind me.
I sail on Wednesday.
you might be mistaken, Thornton, if you think Miss Hale has a bad opinion of you.
and you might not judge her as harshly as you do. In fact...
as you say, Mr Bell, your business in Milton's finished.
and now the future of this mill is no concern of yours. I'm afraid I'm busy, too. Good day.
I think Margaret is looking so much better. Don't you, Dixon?
Yes, miss. Now we're back in London.
I'm so glad she decided to stay with us in Harley Street, even though now she's quite the heiress.
she's looking much like her old self.
what do you think, Henry?
I think Margaret looks very well.
now she's so rich, if you don't ask her soon we'll have a job keeping others away.
I will try her when I'm ready. It's really none of your concern.
as it is, I'm helping her with business matters.
she will use some of her money to help Frederick.
I hope you can. She will love you for ever!
Margaret. We're engaged at the Pipers' on Saturday.
Oh, dear! I know that look. Margaret is about to tell us something and we cannot argue.
she had that look on her face when she insisted on giving up dancing lessons when we were nine.
Margaret, what's wrong? -- Nothing. But Edith is right.
I'm so grateful to you, Aunt, for taking me in.
but I've been back in London for a long time now.
I'm of age and I am of means.
Henry is helping me to understand my financial affairs and responsibilities.
we are trying to help Frederick.
we will probably not succeed, but it would have pleased Mother and Father that we are trying.
it is time for me to take responsibility for my life.
you want to leave us? Sholto would cry so!
no. But I would like to make my own decisions for my day--to--day life.
I would like to keep to my room if I wish.
I would like not to go to the Pipers if I wish. And I don't.
I...CAN'T stand them.
I don't like London society.
I learnt something when I went back to Helstone, expecting it to be the paradise I knew as a child.
try as we might, happy as we were, we can't go back.
I told you. I was right and John was wrong.
for once you must admit I was right.
if you'd invested in Watson's scheme, you'd have made thousands. Enough to get out of trouble!
admit it.
I will ask Watson if he will lend John some money but he was very angry when John would not join him in the venture.
he says a gentleman must pay his own way!
and you can think again about Ann Latimer! I'm sure she won't have you now.
you mustn't mind losing the house, Mother.
I don't mind about the house.
I care about you.
thank God Fanny's taken care of.
it'll just be you and I again.
I have excellent news. -- Really?
you have made money.
what, since yesterday? While I slept? How clever of me!
money makes money. -- I would rather earn it and put it to good use.
Margaret! You're sounding a little... Well, I hate to notice but a little revolutionary.
mr Bell was a shrewd fellow. He bought into a 100--1 investment with a chap named Watson.
Watson? Fanny Thornton's husband? -- The very one.
being hailed as wonder boy. Probably a nine--days wonder, but nevertheless Fanny's struck gold.
which is more than we can say for her brother.
Oh?
he wouldn't have anything to do with it. Far too principled.
might just be the last straw.
I'm afraid you'll soon be looking for a new tenant, Margaret.
what a nice Christmas present it will be, " said Charlotte.
but I hope... "
Where's Higgins? -- He's finishing off something.
mr Arnott will...
.sometimes bring her cart into... "
I said, have you heard owt about Miss Margaret?
still here.
just because it's the last shift, Master, doesn't mean we shouldn't finish the job well.
I am nobody's master any more, Higgins.
if you're ever in a position to take on workers again there's a fair number of us who'd be happy to run a mill for you.
I got up a petition to collect the names.
anyway, I was asking about Miss Margaret. Have you heard how she's doing?
she's well.
she's in London. We'll not see her again.
I thought she might have gone to Spain.
why would she go there? -- To see her brother, now he's her only family.
her brother?
she doesn't have a brother.
him that were over when their mother were dying. Kept it a secret, they did.
my Mary used to fetch things for them.
she's a quiet girl, but she talks to me.
why wouldn't Mr Hale tell me he had a son? -- Something to do with the law.
found himself on the wrong side of the Navy. In real danger, he was.
(WHISPERS） He was her brother.
well.
Thornton?
I'll bid you good day.
goodbye, Higgins. Good luck.
Henry?
I wonder, would you help me?
I've decided I need to go to Milton and I'd like you to come with me.
of course. Whatever I may do. I'm...I'm at your service. Always.
(WHISPERS） Yes. Yes!
he's not here, if you've come to crow over him. He's not here.
come to look over your possessions, have you? And he's worked all his life for them.
you once accused me of not knowing what kind of man I'd rejected. And you were right.
but if you think I've come to triumph over him, that I don't feel keenly the misfortune of this empty place...
.then you don't know me at all.
I don't know where he is.
don't think I'm worried for myself.
he'll see me right. He always has.
there's a ten--minute stop here. Sorry for the delay, but we're halfway back to London.
I think we have to wait for a northbound train to pass.
where are you going?
to London.
I...I've been to Milton.
you'll not guess where I've been.
you've been to Helstone?
I thought those had all gone! -- I found it in the hedgerow.
you have to look hard.
why were you in Milton?
on business. Well, that is, I have a business proposition.
Oh, dear! I need Henry to help me explain.
you don't need Henry to explain.
I...I have to get this right. It's a business proposition.
I have some ￡15, 000.
it is lying in the bank at present, earning very little interest.
now, my financial advisers tell me that if you were to take this money and use it to run Marlborough Mills you could give me a very much better rate of interest.
so, you see, it is only a business matter.
you'd not be obliged to me in any way.
it is you who would be doing...
.me the service.
london train about to depart. London train is about to depart.
Henry, I...
goodbye, Margaret.

brother mute
why did you save me?
I am going to die sooner or later
no, you shouldn't kill yourself
you can speak!
I didn't speak a word...
because I refused to
I hated everyone
Why?
l was involved in illegal activities
later...
l fell in love with arich girl
her father found out about me...
and he was against our marriage
he setup aplotand parted us
after that attack I can hardly fight
later, the girl killed herself
because her so-called respectable father...
raped her
so can you understand why turned cynical?
how come you're so good to me?
because...
you bear a slight resemblance to that girl
but, don't worry
I am not in love with you
what l have, is sympathy
for the way they treat you.
you shouldn't kill yourself
we'll retaliate
without my permission...
no girl has walked out of this door

yan Shunzi, you are no match for me

brother Yan...
so what now?
l will kill you if you so desire
or you'll listen to me if you wish to live on
alright, I'll do as you say
who found the body?
I did
chief, he's the butler of the Liao Family
is this the master bed room?
no, this is his study
my Master usually slept in the lady's room
Where's the lady?
she left with the young master and young miss the day before, to visit her parents
so your master...
was all by himself last night?
yes... No
what?
Ainu was there too
Ainu?
there's someone here to see you, Miss
miss Ainu, Chief Ji, recently appointed
he wants to see you
you all please go out
yes
chief Ji, I am amazed to see you here
this is a surprise!
no, I am here on business
then it must be important, I guess
I'd like to ask you
were you at Liao's house last night?
since when did the brothel...
fall under your jurisdiction?
no, it isn't about the brothel
you see, Liao was murdered last night
his servants said that,
you were the last person to see him
are you inferring that l killed him?
no, I dare not
but according to his servants ...you left around midnight
and his time of death was around midnight...
based on the accumulation of snow
then, did he die before I left...
or was it afterwards?
that...
it's so simple!
lf you can prove that he died before I left
then I must be the murderer
you may arrest me right now.
lf you have got no proof,
then let me tell you
he was still alive when I left
he must've died after was gone
how could you prove that...
he was still alive when you left?
then how can you prove that ...he died while l was still there?
chief Ji
I guess you are new in town
liao Guoqiang was amiser...
an alcoholic and a sex-addict
he ought to have been dead ages ago
why do you care for his death?
alright, Chief Ji
anything else?
lf not, please leave
I'd like to rest now
see you
chief, you're leaving?
did you see that?
Ainu killed Liao last night
and the officers are here
what?
lady Chun, you shouldn't spoil her
you even taught her lungful l think our business often years...
will be jeopardized by her one day
you...
don't forget
you kidnapped a young girl ten years ago...
and you were attacked from all sides
you had nowhere to go
had it not been for me to save your life, ...do you think you'd be here now?
I left the martial arts world behind
and opened up this brothel for you
this is disgraceful enough for me
aren't you satisfied?
you were willing to help
that's because I love you
too bad, I am not interested in men
love is strange indeed!
you love me, but l like Ainu
Ainu killed someone it was Liao Guoqiang this time
zhuo Wenjian, LiZhangan will be next
then it will be our turn
Why?
you...
I am just testing your skills
and making sure if l'm still in control
Bao Hu is worried that...
you will kill us one day
why did you kill Liao Guoqiang?
for no particular reason l think I'm becoming like you, hating men
that's why l seek revenge
this could mean that l'll love you more
and I don't yearn for the affection of men
then, were you excited...
when you first had a taste of blood?
very much so!
but it's similar to the snow outside
totally tasteless!
Ainu
do you intend to kill us in the future?
of course not
with you, it's like we're one in being
I can't live without you
Ainu
one frog jumped over the pond... plop
two frogs jumped over, jumped over plop
I drink
li, what's going on?
one frog jumped over the pond plop
two frogs jumped over, jumped over lf you do suspect Ainu then how about we arrest her?
alright, I'll go
no, I'll
enough nonsense
the chief must have his new working style
but then,
Ainu has strong patronage, we can't touch her
do you know her history?
whores have no history
they're either forced or have volunteered
it's the same story
the word is she's quite outstanding
that's true
especially in bed
have you tried it?
I can't afford to
Ainu serves the rich and the famous
I am just a small fry
besides...
Ainu herself selects her clients
no matter how rich you are...
she gives a damn!
what kind of clients does she prefer?
as l just mentioned
apart from the dead Liao
zhuo Wenjian and master Wei
Mr. Zhou, Miss Ainu is here
Hello, Miss Ainu
this way please
please wait for me here
okay
please
this way please
master, Miss Ainu is here
come...
please
do come in
please
come in
leave...
what are you doing?
what are you doing?
master Wei, we're here to save you
save me? Bullshit
is somebody here...
are you alright, Sir?
who might you be?
Ji De, chief police officer
go to hell
what's going on, master?
who is he?
chief police officer
he's asking for you outside
I am here to rescue you
rescue me?
sorry l am late
get out of here
out! Now
right now, or l'll complain...
to your supervisor tomorrow - Get out - I...
out!
Mr. Zhou, what's with your master?
he's a baitworm out from his experimenting all these years
he only gets turned on by bondage now
that's what it's all about
now you should understand, chief
let me buy you a drink, come on
C'mon, drink up
Ainu, come on
Ainu
come on
what's with you?
come on, l want you
what do you want?
it's you I desire
WeiJianzhong
I remember the first time
you tied me up in bed...
from that day on I swore ...l will tie you up one day
and kill you
the time has come
it's your turn now
chief, what is it?
I'm still worried
you can't go in, chief
the lights are off
see, you wouldn't really want to intrude
don't, you bad boy!
the master's still got it
Ainu is moaning!
just leave
C'mon, get going
you never thought of this day, did you?
miss Ainu, you're leaving?
you're still here, Chief Ji
you must be worried
that's why you waited for me here, isn't it?
you better go check inside
or else you wouldn't know...
if he's really dead
let's go
what do you want?
l want to go inside
he's asleep right now
you put me in a difficult spot l think tonight,
she wouldn't dare
Oh, no! Fire!
fire!
Hurry! Put it out!
Ainu
chief
chief Ji, how can I help you?
you set the fire to kill master Wei last night
I am here to arrest you
set a fire? Any witnesses?
sure wasn't any fire when I left
but just after you left
the whole house was inflames
then it must've been someone else...
who set the fire after l left
I didn't see anyone going in
did you see me start the fire?
even though you didn't leave a trace
I'll have to arrest you today
chief Ji, not only you've no evidence...
to prove that l am the murderer
even if you've seen me
you should've done your homework
do you know who owns this place?
lf you really want to arrest me
you should ask the governor's dad first
who is it?
good swordplay
so it was you!
you've visited me twice
just returning the favour
this is my turn
do you want to tell me who's the murderer?
no, on the contrary
I am here to ask you to step away
Why?
why not?
I'm backed by this
put down the sword
now you will step away, won't you?
tell me
why do you try to stop me?
it's for your own sake
otherwise, you'll be sorry
what if l won't listen?
fine, I'll tell you
zhuo Wenjian will be the next
what? Nonsense!
Ainu wants to kill me?
that's rubbish
master, she means it for real
can't be
you've got too much time on your hand
now you're interfering
are you sick of being an officer?
no, sir
but Mr. Liao and Mr. Wei...
what's so strange about that?
we all have to die sometime
you can't hold Ainu responsible
however, lf you don't see Ainu ...you will be safer
master Zhuo, you don't want me anymore?
Ainu honey
my baby, of course not
I'd rather die than not seeing you
my little baby
come over
yes
chief Ji, you want to join the fun?
master Zhuo
do you want him to join us?
of course not
get out
old master
get out now
right
get out
go bring the girls in
yes...
hurry
what are these three doing here?
you always say you want to try new stuff
LEM me give you the four winds today
the four winds?!
Yes, it's the brothel's special
why aren't you taking your clothes off?
I am the north wind lf you want me, then it's up to you
come get me the wine
master Zhuo
perhaps it's time for you to rest
what? I am only on the west wind yet
what happened?
knock it down - Sure
what's going on?
don't move - Men - Yes
get the governor
yes
master...
father...
you can't run this time - Cuffs - Here
wait
chief Ji, let her go
she's the murderer, sir
I said, let her go right now
didn't you hear me?
Yes, sir
allow me to take you home, Miss Ainu
and I apologize for this incident
chief Ji, about what happened here
you can't let anyone know
why not?
because the old master...
died of an aphrodisiac overdose
the governor's reputation is at stake
so you had better not tell anyone
all men are the same
they all lust after us
I have watched them die one after another
I am ecstatic with joy
liao Guoqiang, WeiJiangzhong, Zhuo Wenjian, ...and one more
LiZhangan

they will kill you...
before you try to kill me lf you really want to kill me l think you can do I tall by yourself

so that l may save my love for you
you men just don't appreciate lf l want to kill you...
Where's the weapon?
come on, search me
come on

I'll indeed search if or not you've a weapon
then again, I didn't ask you to hug me
well, you wanna sleep with me...
one last time before you kill me?
what's the hurry?
let me strip first
then you'll know, if or not l'm carrying a weapon
is Ainu here?
Yes, she's inside
what?
l want to go inside
this is a special door
it can only be opened from inside
not from the outside
you deserve to die
you knew l am here to kill you
but still you lust after me
you...
somebody, please help
knock it open
you deserve this
never could you have thought that this very special room you built...
to abuse and ravage women
and you'll end up dying here!
do you remember...
the first time in here...
when you whipped me?
is there no way in, except for this door?
it's just this door, no other way
come on
make way you guys, I'm coming
go on in
he's already dead
chief Ji, you're a good officer
but you've caught the wrong person
after her...
move
hold it
chief Ji, two years back l was like them
got kid napped from other places
they sold me to Lady Chun it was a living hell!
l was coerced into prostitution
I killed a few men
I killed them...
only for revenge lf you're looking for the real culprits
arrest them
bitch
lady Chun, we've got a problem
what is it?
Ainu plotted against us
they got intercepted at the gate
what happened to Ainu?
she turned out smart, and fled l thought she must've been hurt
didn't l tell you earlier!
the brothe l will be ruined by Ainu
what?
I am going to kill her!
the brothel is finished
we could start a new ata different place but l can't live without her
you've been blinded by lust
Ainu did this for revenge
she won't hurt me, never
because she and I, we're one - Come on - Go
will you fight against us...
for her?
I am not sure
but let me tell you
no one harms Ainu when I'm here
kill
attack
this is scary
here's the key, let the girls go
hurry...
come on
run... run away
hurry up
getaway...
quick... leave fast
Mr. Bao
Mr. Bao
what is it?
Ainu set the girls free
all of them
didn't you hear what l said?
I've said it before
no one harms Ainu as long as I'm here
can't you see that...
this is her revenge?
do you believe that?
no way, she and I are the same person
lady Chun
we should settle this once and for all
you want to die already?
your yinyang ghost hands aren't powerful enough ...for my spine-chilling sword
Why? Bao Hu?
it's not worth it
we will still be together
I ain't really sure
the likes of you don't deserve my love
but it's too late for me
Ainu, you wouldn't stop loving me...
now that l am handicapped?
no, l won't
because I've never loved you
looks like this is it
today is the time for revenge l wanted to use hate for vengeance
but l failed
hit on a better plan instead thinking, no one else would've used it
I used love to take my revenge
I killed Liao Guoqiang, WeiJianzhong
LiZhangan, Zhuo Wenjian by love
to bring the brothel down
I used love to come between you and Bao Hu
Never'd imagine the damage love could cause
you...
you...
didn't expect you to be more vicious than me
stop it!
we are both despicable, heartless, merciless, cruel and sick
now perhaps you'd have a glimpse of...
how repulsive you are!
you don't need to!
I am dying anyway
I guess this is karma
even though you've killed me...
yet l don't hate you a bit
Ainu
I... I love you
could you kiss me once more...
before I die?
it's my last request
have pity on me
thank you, Ainu
thank you for dying with me
I had a poisonous pill in my mouth l was chewing it...
when you kissed me
you are unlike me
you've still got your conscience
and a little love
Ainu
Ainu
Ainu!
I am too late, Ainu
Oh, Ainu...
my name is Charlie Wood.
I think I made a big mistake.
higher! I can't, sweetheart.
any higher, and you're gonna hit the moon.
and get a bump?
that's right, smart girl, and get a bump.
Oh, hey!
Hey, Emily, look who it is.
Hi, Isabella!
Hi, Emilia.
there we go. Hi, how are you?
okay. I've got her lunch.
an extra thermos of apple juice. Her Elmo doll.
Mr. Fizzles. Twelve grapes in a bag.
I got it, Mr. Wood.
Thanks. I'll see you at 5: 00.
right, sweetheart. Come here.
high five.
first the "Wyoming Widow," and now the "Oregon Undertaker."
they just pulled a dead girl out of the reservoir.
God! Suicide?
if she chopped off her own arms and legs before strangling herself and then jumping off the pier, then maybe.
pen, I'm eating.
they're figuring it's the Oregon Undertaker again.
that'll be the fourth girl in six months.
each one mutilated and disemboweled worse than the last.
pen! Pen!
Oh, sorry, baby.
listen, Charlie, you don't have to do this, you know.
of course I do. We can't go on living on one income anymore.
how many nights this week have you given Emily Spaghettis?
she likes Spaghettis.
Hey, baby, trust me. Once they buy your book, you're gonna...
not a single publisher has called, Pen. Not a single one.
the term "black hole" is of very recent origin.
it was coined in 1969 by the American scientist John...
we handle nearly 200, 000 calls a day.
the hotlines to some of the biggest corporations in the country!
Centel Online, Melanie speaking.
how can I help you?
Melanie speaking. How can I help you?
my name is Melanie. Have a great day.
do you only hire women named Melanie?
it's a trick of the trade.
callers like to think they get the same Service Rep.
this here is the Melanie and John section.
and you are over here with the Jeniffers and Stevens.
this is you.
what do you mean this is me?
I was told I had a supervisor position.
you gotta spend six months in the trenches before you can interview for supervisor.
but I have a Ph. D. Uh, surely...
look, you want the job or not?
Yeah.
great!
Gus here will help get you started. Okay, Steven?
it's Charlie.
sure is.
in the file menu, do you see where it says "open"?
Okl-doki. Can you open the "open" menu?
Oki-doki. Again, my name is Steven.
thank you for calling Centel. You have a great day.
I actually liked Gus at first sight.
welcome to hell, dick head.
well, maybe not first sight.
I'm sorry?
hell!
people hooked up to machines like slaves.
and the smell?
it's pure underarm.
okay. So, um, what do we do here?
Centel Online. Steven speaking. How may I help you?
Oki-doki, ma'am. Have you checked to see if your POS is on?
no, ma'am, I'm not a retard. That's the protocol...
sorry? Oki-doki.
I'm gonna check that with my supervisor real quick, and I'm gonna put you on hold.
you feel feisty, you whiny, little turkey-neck bitch?
why don't you hop up on my dick and bounce and see if that fires up your monitor, sweetheart?
Hello, ma'am. Thanks for waiting.
I'm gonna transfer you over to our technical service department, oki-doki? Please hold.
in the kingdom of the blind, the one-eyed dwarf is king.
that's my wife, Stephanie. Ex-wife. I keep forgetting.
and that there is my little daughter, Thais.
that's a pretty name.
Yes, it's Greek. It means "beloved."
thais has this problem with her eye pressure, and, uh, doctor said of she doesn't get a cornea transplant like in a year, then, uh, she's gonna go blind.
every year 65, 000 diabetics develop proliferative retinopathy, one of the leading precursors to blindness.
she's not diabetic.
so, are you gonna be able to afford the surgery before she...
Yeah, yeah, I hope so. If everything, you know, goes as expected.
what do you mean?
huh?
I have a plan.
hell's bells.
you see, Steven, I'm 66 years old now and my husband is asking me to do it donkey style.
okay, ma'am, um.
I'm going to transfer you to our technical department.
please, hold. Good God!
are you expecting a call?
um...
Centel Online. This is Charlie.
how... uh, Steven. How can I help you?
Yeah, my IP address is stuck on 169.
okay. Sir, um, have you checked to make sure your computer is on?
didn't you hear what I just said?
Yes. Oh, IP address. IP address.
here we go.
your IP address should start with 81.
so, does it?
I just told you it was stuck on 169.
do they let the cleaning lady answer the phone in there?
don't "sir" me, asshole. Just help me out with my fucking problem!
please, hold on a second while I check with our technical department.
Yes, sir, your wife is one of 3. 8% of American women who secretly engage in regular online chats with a total stranger, accompanied by vigorous masturbation.
my wife just died three months ago.
but I'd like to discuss that with your supervisor, Steven.
Hey. Charlie? Wait, wait.
it's my fault.
don't worry about it. I'll be alright.
look, you know I said I had a plan.
Yep.
why don't you come in on it with me?
you know, be like a partner or something, you know?
I sure as hell feel like I owe you one, man.
it's not anything illegal, is it?
Dickinson!
look, meet me at the Monkey Wrench, 9: 00, okay? Yeah?
Choo-choo, Charlie.
Hey, Mac. Two bottles of your finest mass- produced lager.
so?
come here.
So,I stumbled across the data base at work.
the online history of each and every member of Centel Online.
look, this is their record. Everyone in the state that went online in the last three months and logged on to an illegal porn site.
right? I figure there's gotta be somebody in here willing to fork over some coin to keep things hush.
they all look the same.
yet they're not.
rev Neville Smalls. What's REV?
Reverend.
exactly. It's brilliant, don't you think?
um, you know, I, um,
I really don't think I'm criminal material, Gus.
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
we're talking about a so-called man of the cloth who likes to watch teenage boys and girls take off their clothes and have God-knows-who do God-knows-what to them.
who's the real criminal here?
I tried to do things by the book, Charlie, and stomached the 9: 00 to 5: 00.
my daughter is about to go blind, Charlie. Blind!
how much are you...
fifty for me, fifty for you. And even hundred.
a hundred? Thousand?! Dollars?
it's not much to preserve one's reputation.
what if somebody gets hurt?
it's a completely nonviolent enterprise.
no harm done whatsoever. And pretty much all I need is for you to be my alibi.
that's all?
that's all.
okay, look.
you pick the blue one and you go back to your old life.
but pick the red one and you finally get to be a free man.
but I must warn you. Once you eat the red one, there's no turning back.
Yes! Great!
I gotta tell you, I was a little nervous about going solo.
rule number one. Preparation is king.
more than anything else we wanna totally rule out the element...
surprise!
Josie, how long were you sitting there?
long enough to ask how you'd feel about bringing in a third.
okay, here's the touching story of how Gus met Josie.
uh, miss?
Yes, sir?
I'm gonna get the check.
Why?
does the chef have curly hair?
no.
I'd better get the check.
you work at the call center, huh?
Yeah, how can you tell?
well, half the town does.
you have that same look the rest of them do.
what look is that?
how much longer 'till I drop dead so I don't have to go to my stupid job anymore.
that look.
Yeah, that'd be the one.
are you from here?
no. Oklahoma!
Oh.
oklahoma, right? What's that like?
nowhere near as sexy as you.
I'll get that!
so, care to hear about our dessert special this evening?
Jesus! You sure are a very forthright and smart girl, ain't you?
that's what they said last year when they crowned me Miss Teen Oklahoma.
whoa... What?
miss Teen Oklahoma? What, last year?
Yeah.
how old are you?
eighteen. More or less.
is it more or is it less?
well, less, I guess.
shit!
what the hell is the matter with you?
you're a child, for Ohrissake's.
do I look like a child?
huh?
alright, okay. Is there anything else you forgot to mention?
who are you?
Charlie Wood. Former coworker of Gus'.
Josie McBroom.
Gus and I were an item back in the day.
what?
I'm sorry, but what are we gonna do?
I want in.
alright, read my lips, okay? No fucking way.
you guys can't do the job without me.
because, dumdum, I'm the only one who can make the call.
if the preacher starts recording you on his answering machine, the first thing they're gonna do is try and match it up with the voice records from the call center.
you guys would be screwed, stuffed, and mounted.
is that true?
kinda.
how d'you work that out?
I told you. I was Miss Teen Oklahoma.
how much do you want?
twenty thousand.
twenty thousand? For making a phone call?
for making "the" phone call.
the average person makes about 1, 140 phone calls each year. None of which go anything like this.
may I speak to the Reverend Smalls, please?
Hi, Revered. Are you by any chance familiar with a website that goes by the name of TeenOrgies. Com?
or YoungAndHung. Com?
someone who knows what the mouse plays when the wife's away.
listen, up, sicko. I have in my hand a list of all your favorite sites, credit card number, dates and times of all your connections.
so you'd better cut the crap.
what do I want?
one hundred thousand dollars.
one hundred thousand dollars.
two hundred thousand?
What?!
you heard me. I want $200, 000, cash.
take it or leave it, Rev.
if I don't have my money by tomorrow evening, the Church Newsletter next month's gonna be a doozy.
and I'll be sending somebody.
well, now,I think that somebody deserves to be made full partner, don't you?
wait!
I took a chance and it worked.
now we each get $ 70, 000.
it's actually 66, 666, follow by an infinite number of sixes.
Thanks, Rain Man. Right, look, from now on, okay, anybody pulls any out-of-the-blue candy- ass stunt, she's out.
if we're partners, let's start acting like it.
this is the plan. I go get the money at 9: 00 P. M. Tomorrow.
at exactly the same time, Charlie enters the Monkey Wrench and pretends that we ran out of gas on the road to Mill Creek.
he also says that I'm on my way to the gas station, the one that opens 24/7. Don't forget to say that.
ten P. M. after I've stashed the money in a locker at the rallway station, I come back and I tell everybody about my walk.
that way, if it comes up, Charlie was at the bar, I was at the gas station.
the guy at the station will testify that he never saw you.
sure. You know why? 'Cause he's blind.
pretty brill.
the following day we meet up at noon.
we divvy up the money and we all go our respective ways.
okay, now, any questions?
Yeah. Why don't we just divvy up the money immediately?
rule number two. Always let the dust settle after a job.
you've been reading "Blackmailing for Dummies," or something?
any questions?
great. Rule number three.
no matter what happens, always stick to the plan.
the next day might've been the longest one I'd ever known.
for the first time since I could remember I'd be able to bring security and happiness to my family.
I couldn't tell you if what I felt pumping through my veins was fear or excitement.
so, Mr. Supervisor, talk to me.
do you have a secretary?
Yep.
is she pretty?
pretty? Um, no. She's more nondescript.
what's her name?
Sharon.
Sharon. Sharon what?
um, Stone.
Sharon Stone?
I know.
so, how was your day?
phenomenal. And to top it off the FBI is sending in the eye.
the what?
the "who" Bionic Supersonic Special Agent.
Ohester Hymes, FBI, aka "The Eye."
which is just what I need with the Undertaker case spinning out of control. No leads, no fingerprints.
honestly, why some folks suddenly have to go and turn into criminals is beyond me.
what if I did?
what if you did what?
if I became a criminal.
like, if I, uh, I don't know, stole some money or something?
I'd arrest you.
but, but let's say, um, let's say, I had to.
you know, like we had no other choice, and I had to steal something, um, because... because I had to. What, what then?
I'd arrest you.
Why?
because a good cop always gets her man.
