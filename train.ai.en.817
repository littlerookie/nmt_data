EMT 32-05, we have a female victim, approximately 25 years old, suffering from a gunshot wound to the head.
bleeding has stabilized.
ETA to the ER is approximately four minutes.
Hey.
can you hear me?
can you hear me?!
Brandi, I'm Detective Messer from the Crime Lab.
can you tell me what happened?
Hey, baby.
Hey, you're doing real good. Okay?
okay, beautiful? You stay with me.
you... You're doing good.
you're gonna be okay, Brandi.
you're in an ambulance. I need to ask you some questions.
now, can you tell me anything-- any description of who did this to you?
you're gonna be fine, baby. All right?
you're gonna be fine.
and I'm not going anywhere.
I'm right here.
she's losing consciousness! I need to intubate!
we need to go code 10!
come on, guys! Let's move!
stay with me.
robbery and two gunshot victims.
Brandi Parsons is on the way to Trinity General.
bullet wound to the head.
Danny's gonna try and get a statement.
restaurant robberies aren't very lucrative.
What'd these guys get?
credit card members and tips?
club Prowl has a cash-only policy.
NYPD brass threw a fit last year when it opened.
how much was stolen?
uh, about 35, 000.
most of the money came from the safe in the back room, the rest from patrons' wallets.
struggled with the shooter.
tore off his mask.
trying to get a composite from some of the patrons, but most were on the ground, didn't get a good look.
wallets on the table, bodies on the ground, right now!
Hey, Mac.
gunshot wound to the femoral artery-- it didn't take long.
a leg is not a normal target when you're shooting to kill.
gunshot wound is close-range.
probably happened during the struggle, and accidentally went off.
unfortunately, the bullet looks deformed.
not sure it'll be usable for striae.
Brandi Parsons fell there when she was shot.
based on the footprint pattern and the void, our shooter killed Ted first, was almost at the exit, then doubled back to shoot our female vic.
Ted attacked the shooter.
Brandi was shot in the back of the head, which indicates she retreated.
why would two opposite reaions incite the exact same response from our killer?
Brandi's been tending bar at Club Prowl for the past six months.
she's still figuring out what she wants to be when she grows up.
we've been dating for about two years.
weird thing is, I was coming there to walk her home.
surprise her, you know.
and then, right when I get there, they're rolling her out on a gurney.
you're going to be okay, buddy.
thanks for saying that.
detective.
how is she?
based on her MRI, the bullet grazed the parietal lobes of her cerebrum.
so it entered the soft tissue.
it didn't hit any bones?
that appears to be the case.
all right, so that's something you can retrieve, right?
I need the bullet as soon as possible.
removing the bullet might be too risky.
but our neurosurgeon, Dr. Gavin Moore, will know more about that possibility when he has her in surgery.
it's scheduled for first thing tomorrow morning.
but for now, Brandi's stabilized.
so do you know if she's allergic to any medications?
God, I should know that.
her mother would know.
she's flying out of Houston first thing tomorrow morning, but I could call her now.
that would be helpful.
is Brandi able to talk?
she's sedated.
I need to ask her a few questions.
I mean, her statement might be the only chance we have of getting the guy who did this to her.
I'm sorry, Detective, but we can't wake her now.
but you're welcome to wait around, and if I feel she's up to talking, I'll let you know.
all right. Thanks.
the marks don't provide the same accuracy as bullet holes, but the trajectory lasers have spoken, and it's unanimous.
that's got to be our launch pad, give or take a few floors.
okay.
how many more floors do you wanna check?
relax. Your GQ will still waiting for you when we're done.
did you hear that?
first sign of life since we got here.
sounds like it's coming from over here.
NYPD. Open up.
Hey, Champ.
wanna do the honors?
is it gone?
I wasn't trying to hurt anybody.
then why'd you shoot tennis balls at the billboard, Nick?
I tried to ignore it.
but it just kept dogging me, night after night.
on and off, on and off, on and...
you know something, Nick, you're starting to piss me off.
so why don't you do me a favor, take a nice big gulp of that coffee, gather your thoughts and start from the beginning.
don't you get it?
I couldn't fight it anymore.
I'd been sober for two and a half years.
things were good.
got the late shift job inputting data at the sports research lab, and...
and then it started.
I couldn't fight it anymore.
I... I started drinking again. I -
Nick, I've had guys in here blame their criminal behavior on wives, bosses, even the devil.
but, I gotta tell ya, this is a new one.
you're telling me you were driven to this by a shiny red light?
I'm a recovering alcoholic.
every day is a battle.
and that tennis ball shooter is the only weapon I had.
I just wanted to make it stop.
Yeah!
go away!
well, mission accomplished.
now you can dry up in Sing Sing.
wait a minute.
I'm really gonna go to prison?
a finger? - Yep.
and judging from the size and bone cells, we're probably looking at a digit from a bird, rodent or reptile.
it was covered in denatured alcohol, a bone preservative.
and once I can narrow down the species, it'll give me a better shot of figuring out where it came from.
and that'll hopefully lead us to our killer.
Yeah.
Thanks.
I love this job.
so many surprises.
Yeah, well, don't keep it to yourself, Hawkes.
what do you got?
DNA I collected from the ski mask didn't give us a database hit.
but it does match traces of dried semen I collected from Brandi Parsons' clothing.
she had sex with our shooter?
so she knew him.
crime of passion?
that's one possibility.
or... she was the inside guy.
they planned this robbery She together, but before she got her cut...
her partner double-crossed her.
your tennis ball shooter isn't responsible for Jenna Donovan's death.
she didn't die from electrocution.
she's got burns marks all over her body, Sid.
how is that possible?
they're postmortem.
so, she was dead before she was electrocuted?
just moments before.
I'm still waiting for blood and tox, but there was a significant amount of fluid in her lungs.
she drowned in the martini glass?
no. The fluid I found was endogenous to her body.
cod was pulmonary edema? - Exactly.
which is not consistent with electrocution or drowning.
right.
she have a heart condition?
no, this PE was noncardiogenic.
got some bruising here on the shoulder.
Yeah, yeah, that's, uh, very recent.
and, uh, when I ran a CT scan, I noticed more evidence of a struggle.
pre-mortem, subdermal bruising.
so the impact to the chest caused pulmonary edema which led to her death?
definitely seems to the cause, but I'm waiting on histopathology to confirm that.
what really strikes me as odd is not how she died, but...
where she died.
Slow-onset pulmonary edema causes acute pain.
most people would've jumped into an ambulance, not an oversized martini glass.
what's all this about?
a UNI brought over Jenna Donovan's purse from her dressing room at the ad agency.
looks like she had quite a sweet tooth.
Yeah, along with fat burning capsules, appetite suppressants, water pills.
a typical meal plan for anyone about to wear next to nothing in the middle of Times Square.
although, the candy doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
let's see what we're looking at...
big wad of cash, latex balloons, and some cotton balls.
you know, Lindsay, I don't think these lollipops are lollipops.
heroin.
well, that changes everything.
certainly does.
at $40 a pop, we're looking at, uh, over $3, 000 in this purse.
and this handle...
is an exact match to the bruise on Jenna's left shoulder.
so somebody went after the bag.
or more specifically, what was in the bag.
but why wouldn't the attacker have taken the lollipops?
she fought off the attacker.
at least in the first round.
sounds like a motive for murder.
you've been here all night.
why don't you go home, get a shower.
I'll stay on the track of the bullet.
Dr. Moore, did you see Brandi yet?
are you gonna be able to help her?
intercranial pressure was causing her brain to swell, so -
sorry.
I performed a ventriculotomy to drain the cerebrospinal fluid which was successful, so we're ready to proceed with the surgery.
how risky is that surgery?
well, all surgeries carry risks, but
excuse me.
just a moment.
we got one dead guy. We got a woman clinging to life.
all that misery for 35 g's.
it's pathetic, isn't it?
if you're not going home, why don't you go get something to eat?
here's our killer.
it's all the information that we were able to get from our witnesses.
so we just need to find everybody with two eyes, a nose, and a mouth.
Hey, beautiful.
just relax.
you're gonna be okay.
and I'm gonna be waiting for you when you come back, okay?
defib on monitor!
you have to stop and shock her now.
please stand back, stand back.
charging.
charging.
doctor!
clear!
she's still in defib.
all right, go up to 360.
clear!
let's go for one more. Clear!
prep her for the OR.
I'll be there in a few minutes.
I need your help.
about an hour ago, I got a call from my brother Charles.
he's been kidnapped by somebody connected to your witness.
I was told if I don't let Brandi Parsons "accidentally" die, my brother will be killed.
that's why you hesitated just now.
that phone call wasn't some kind of idle threat.
my brother sounded scared.
how'd they know where to find him?
I don't know.
we share a practice together.
they're probably going after you.
you weren't there, so they went for the next best thing.
here's the address.
and I just got this message, sent from my brother's cell phone.
these guys really want Brandi Parsons dead.
someone in the hospital is watching us.
I'll save the girl, Detective Taylor.
but please save Charles.
we've got a kidnapping.
what?
Dr. Moore's brother.
get someone from your squad over to Charles Moore's medical office ASAP.
Brandi Parsons can I. D. the shooter, so maybe someone in her circle can, too.
let's interview her landlord, her family, her friends.
see what they know.
her boyfriend Paul mentioned that her mother's on her way in from Houston.
her mother?
Brandi Parsons doesn't have a mother.
she died ten years ago.
closest family member I found is an aunt in North Carolina.
I don't think Paul Larkin is her boyfriend.
have you seen Brandi Parsons' boyfriend?
he left about five minutes ago.
has he been in on this the whole time?
he just jumped in the ambulance.
he said he was her boyfriend.
I mean, is this kid connected to our shooter?
you had no way of knowing, Danny.
we'll find him.
Yeah, I'm gonna find him.
I'm right here.
her hand in the ambulance.
paul was kissing Brandi's hand.
swab it and collect samples from anyone else who had contact with her so we can eliminate their DNA.
we have one advantage.
what's that?
paul Larkin doesn't know we know he's in on it.
paul Larkin was there early, scouting the place.
I've run his name through the system, got nothing.
we need to find the minutes right before and after the robbery, get a clear image of our killer, see if we can find out who he is.
he's our best chance at finding our hostage, Charles Moore.
this is right around 11: 15.
the shooter must have gone out the back door and called Paul.
it doesn't look like murder was part of the plan.
kidnapping probably wasn't, either.
and if I fast-forward, here's where Paul Larkin jumped into the ambulance and said he was Brandi Parsons' boyfriend.
these guys aren't exactly pros.
based on the footprint pattern the killer left at the scene, shooting Brandi wasn't premeditated.
he came back into the room to shoot her.
we thought he was eliminating his partner in crime.
you're backing off the theory of a double cross.
our shooter's semen was on Brandi's clothes.
these two knew each other.
if his mask hadn't been pulled off, she never would've recognized him.
it's you!
she was shot because she was able to I. D. the killer by name.
it's the address of a jewelry store on St. Mark's Place.
so, how does this connect with Jenna Donovan?
well, it all adds up to one very unique ring.
the pieces of broken glass I found in Jenna's handbag -
they were part of a convex lens.
a magnifying glass.
right. It was the centerpiece of the ring.
I also found DNA on the band that matched DNA from a hair I found in the prongs.
not Jenna's.
well, w does 91X fit in?
well, inside the convex lens was a grain of rice which was inscribed with the address, 91X.
it also had a Japanese kanji.
I looked it up. Its translation is "magic."
magic?
our heroin lollipops tested positive for high levels of fentanyl.
Lindsay, when fentanyl and heroin are mixed, the street name is magic.
fentanyl?
that's a pain killer for cancer patients.
which explains why Jenna didn't feel any pain from the pulmonary edema.
and with the amount of product and cash she was hauling around, she was probably a user and a dealer.
magic.
Yeah.
cool.
how did you know?
we got something that matches.
well, where did you get that?
Jenna Donovan's handbag.
you know her?
should I?
well, we thought you might keep a record of people who order special request jewelry.
Oh, the kanji rings aren't special requests.
they're actually one of our biggest sellers.
still didn't answer our question.
do you know Jenna Donovan?
we found jewelry from your store with a kanji that matches the tattoo on your back.
we also found a hair-- a red hair-- caught in the prongs of a broken ring.
your hair is red.
I don't know her.
I'd get rid of that cat if I were you.
I didn't kill her.
Patti, come on.
these magic lollipops are like the hot new thing.
look, I told you-- I'm sorry she's dead, but those lollipops aren't worth killing for.
listen to me.
I already got you on possession of heroin.
just a hop, skip and a jump to murder if I work this right, and for your information, I'm very good.
especially since Jenna's dead body shows us that she was in one hell of a fight right before that party.
okay, yeah.
I went to go see her right before her big splash on the billboard, and we got into it.
Patti, what are you doing here?
I'm about to start work.
look, I just need a few, all right?
stop it! I told you on the phone-- no money, no candy.
I've been coming to you for six months.
you know that I'm good for it.
leave.
give me this...
we knocked each other around, but when I left, she was just as alive as I am.
that knocking around lead to an injury that caused her death, Patti.
what's that mean?
what's going to happen to me?
ask your lawyer.
our vic's body couldn't help but remind me of my Great Uncle Andy.
Oh, hearing that is enough to make any model break into tears.
Oh, no, there's no physical resemblance.
although he was in freakishly superior shape for an octogenarian.
but, no, what I mean is, Uncle Andy would never finish telling a story.
every time you thought he was done, he'd find something more to say.
so you're saying that Jenna Donovan's body is telling a different story, which means that Patti's off the hook.
the subdermal bruise didn't kill Jenna.
affirmative.
when I reviewed the tox report, her antibodies were spiking off the charts, like she was fighting some type of pathogen in her system.
so a virus or a parasite could have caused the pulmonary edema.
it's possible, but I haven't been able to find anything specific yet.
although, in my attempt to do so, I decided to reexamine the burns on Jenna's body.
the majority were thermal-- caused by the electrocution-
but at least one burn on her left arm is more consistent with a chemical burn.
and I have to admit, so far, I can't explain it.
and there's one more thing that I found curious.
Yeah.
microscopic organisms.
diatoms.
which would be irrelevant if they hailed from a freshwater source, but these are marine diatoms.
they were in her stomach.
so, she would have had to swallow saltwater.
what exactly was in that martini glass?
Dr. Moore's brother is still out there.
keep trying to locate a signal from Charles Moore's cell phone.
and Danny, you call me the second you have something.
mac, I made a positive I. D. on the finger.
it's from corynorhinus townsendii.
how did the finger from a bat wind up in our killer's ski mask?
I don't know, but because it was preserved,
I called a few stores that sell bones as specimens.
long or short list?
very short list of one.
I know they're not very formal I. D.'s, but all my current employees are in these photos.
we have very low turnover here.
that's him.
he said his name is Paul Larkin, but I have a feeling you're going to tell me something different.
well, he was honest about his first name, but his last name's Campbell.
let me guess: he didn't show up for work today.
how did you know?
is he okay?
well, that's what we're trying to find out.
here's what you were asking about.
how would it have broken off?
I don't know-- customers aren't allowed to handle them.
they were locked up, so, an employee must have keyed into the display case.
ready for tonight?
dude, what are you doing here?
I got everything.
put that away.
his work station's over there.
we're going to need his address, and with your permission, we'd like to look around, maybe take a few fingerprints, DNA samples.
well, you're welcome to check it out, but we don't touch anything without gloves.
paul Campbell's work glove?
DNA you swabbed from Brandi's hand is a match to the DNA I swabbed from a print inside Paul's glove.
forget that.
I just picked up a signal from Charles Moore's cell phone.
it's coming from Paul's apartment.
NYPD!
NYPD. Come out with your hands up.
Oh, they're gone.
Yeah.
paul doesn't live here alone.
signs of a struggle.
Charles Moore was duct taped.
looks like it took the kidnapper more than a few tries to get him that way.
all right, we need to find out where they went and who's sharing this dump with Paul. All right?
everything's in Paul Campbell's name.
phone, credit card, cable.
his roommate doesn't exist, at least not on paper.
but he does electronically.
I located the user's history.
circumvented the security access to his e-mail. Name's James Petty, and he requested blueprints for every building surrounding Club Prowl.
nice.
that could be our shooter-slash-kidnapper right there.
you find something, Messer?
Hey, zoom in on the right corner for a second.
you see that?
you tipping me for my zooming skills?
the Treasury Department started embedding blue and red fibers into currency to prevent counterfeiting.
Yeah, the fibers are consistent.
at some point, they probably realized that all the stolen cash couldn't fit in the box, so they dumped it out to find a bigger one.
in the process, one of the bills must've ripped and got caught on the edge.
so these guys are mailing the money somewhere.
it's a smart move, not keeping cash on them or in the apartment.
if you can raise the ink from the pouch, maybe we can get an address.
Oh, wow, you're doing science now?
it's odd that they left it here.
they knew we'd find this place eventually.
Charles Moore's phone got us here.
where is it?
sounds like it's coming from underneath the couch.
boom.
it's Charles Moore's phone.
the question is, where is Charles Moore?
I found our murder weapon.
under a microscope?
come take a look.
it's an Irukanji jellyfish.
microscopic, but fatal.
and Sid said...
one burn on her left arm is more consistent with a chemical burn.
its poisonous tentacles caused Jenna's pulmonary edema.
Irukanji jellyfish can only survive in sea water.
true.
I think our olive is guilty of concealing a deadly weapon.
I found high concentrations of sodium chloride near a cut on the beach ball.
that's how they transferred it.
our killer injected jellyfish-infested seawater into the beach ball.
and then finished blowing it up.
then, right before Jenna was going to jump into the water, our killer cut a small slit in the ball, so the jellyfish could escape.
who would go to all that trouble?
I tested the spout, I found DNA from two donors, a male and a female.
I also found high levels of ketones, which is consistent with anorexia.
so maybe a rival model?
or an ad executive...who has diabetes or on a low carb diet.
lia and Damien had access to every part of that billboard, and the beach ball, not to mention the jellyfish.
one of them killed Jenna Donovan.
how do we prove which one?
we get them to tell us.
big fat dead end.
it was a long shot.
the ink's too diluted.
James Petty never stayed around in one place too much.
I guess he couldn't take the heat.
thanks for the help, Doc.
I'm not even going to ask.
mac, I bet when you hired me, you didn't know about my baking skills.
doesn't look too appetizing.
it will in a second.
see, I couldn't lift the address off the pouch before, because it was too diluted.
the organic solvents in the ink will do that.
Yeah, but lucky for us, they can't stand the heat.
I stuck the package in an incubator oven for seven minutes.
and after the solvents evaporated, I could read the residue under the UV lamp, and I got an address.
great work.
I also talked to Dr. Moore-- Brandi's going to be all right.
let's hope we can return the favor, get his brother home safe.
tell me where the money is.
I haven't seen it.
I just called Worldsend.
they said you signed for it!
special delivery.
down on the floor! Hands behind your head.
don't even think about it!
don't even think about it!
Dr. Moore.
let's go call your brother.
he'll want to know you're okay.
Mr. Boyfriend.
detectives.
your assistant said you'd be working late.
what's this?
it's a warrant to get a sample of water from your tank.
what are you looking for?
a murder weapon.
Irukanji jellyfish.
we think you have some in that tank.
they're almost impossible to see, but they can kill you with just one sting.
do you know anything about this?
no.
what's going on here?
Jenna Donovan's death wasn't an accident; she was murdered.
murdered? - Actually poisoned.
by one of those guys.
deliberately put into the beach ball.
Mr. Barnes, who maintains your tank?
Lia, she's been collecting jellyfish ever since her trip to Australia two years ago.
Lia, we need to talk.
this is ridiculous...
where you going, Lia?
you know, only two people handled that beach ball before Jenna.
now, we have DNA that proves one of them was female.
if that happens to be a match to you, do you have anything to say then, Lia?
why would you want to kill Jenna?
I don't know what you're talking about.
well, hold on a second.
Lia, you handed that beach ball to me.
I was your target.
Why?
you killed my career.
I created the martini mix campaign.
the slogan, the tone, even the girl in the martini glass.
it was all my idea.
but the night before I was supposed to pitch it, he took our CEO to a strip club, acted like the idea was all his.
so in order to get back at Damien, you decided to kill him.
you put the jellyfish in with the water, and then you had Damien blow up the beach ball.
it almost worked, too.
except for the slit you made in the beach ball, didn't release the jellyfish until it got into Jenna's hands and she started batting it around.
I didn't know it would harm anyone else.
Irukanji jellyfish can't survive in freshwater.
you're right, but all it took was one landing on Jenna's arm to kill her.
put your hands behind your back.
you're under arrest for the murder of Jenna Donovan.
let's go.
bitch!
get off him!
please, no! Stop it!
Brett, everyone is fighting out there.
you have to do something before they ruin our wedding.
Brett, what the hell is wrong with you? Get up!
so, the hatfields and the mccoys couldn't keep it together long enough to merge the family fortunes.
who's the vic?
the groom.
Brett dohn, 28 years old.
guy made it big in the stock market.
the bride's emma blackstone.
she's a mess.
she give you anything?
from what she said between the hysterics, I don't think she knows anything.
I'm going to try to talk to her again, though.
the eight tranquilizers mommy gave her should have kicked in by now.
right here.
gives new meaning to cold feet.
no apparent gunshot wound or stab wounds, no signs of petechial hemorrhaging.
so he wasn't strangled.
could be internal injuries from the fight.
won't know for sure till we get him on the table.
wasn't in the fight.
no one I interviewed has seen the groom since the rehearsal dinner last night.
so, how did the only guy not throwing punches end up dead?
C. O.D. Could be an overdose or alcohol poisoning.
smells like 100 proof to me.
looks like blood in his mouth.
that's consistent with trauma to his airway.
don't see any damage to his throat.
aspiration could be from a chest wound.
what was that?
is that bubble wrap?
there's blood under there.
I'm going to get this guy to autopsy, let sid tell us the rest of the story.
there was no sign of a struggle.
there's no blood.
whatever happened to him didn't happen in this tent.
so, george, you said you went out with brett after the rehearsal dinner?
Yeah, it was his last night of being a free agent, so, we got wasted, you knho, bar owpping.
you were with him the whole time?
Yeah, it's kind of fuzzy.
at, like, midnight, I looked up, everyone was gone, so I hit the next bar.
I just can't believe he's never coming back.
so, I'm putting together a list of wedding guests and employees.
see if we can tack down a motive.
there's a smudge on the curb consistent with the yellow stain on the bottom of brett dohn's shoe.
he stepped on the curb while it was still wet.
I'll find out when the curb was painted.
our groom was alive there, but dead in there.
killed somewhere in between.
no blood, no drag marks, no murder weapon.
how do you kill a guy in a 20-foot space and leave no evidence at all?
alarm Clock 1 Press&hold side[Camera]key to cancel Snooze Mode my very first dead ringer.
I guess, uh, you didn't pull that out of his pocket, sid, did you?
found it in his abdominal cavity.
it's our victim's phone.
it was cushioned with these.
packing peanuts?
wait. So, he was stuffed and then wrapped like a gift?
maybe the killer changed his mind during the murder and tried to save the victim, you know, stop the bleeding.
know what killed him?
defensive wounds here, but this nasty gash was the fatal blow.
wound indicates sharp force trauma.
any idea what the weapon was?
based on the serration patterns, it's almost as if the groom were stabbed with three different weapons.
but whatever the killer used punctured the lung, causing the aspirated blood you saw at the scene, as well as exsanguination.
he bled out, but we didn't find a drop of blood anywhere.
I mean, there was no blood near the tent, nothing in the surrounding areas in the park.
had to be killed somewhere else.
you got a time of death?
best estimate, between 2: 00 and 3: 00 A. M.
hold up-- for the paint to get on the groom's shoe, he had to step on the wet curb in the park.
according to flack, the curb was painted at 6: 00 A. M.
Yeah, so, how's a guy die at 2: 00 A. M.
then step on a curb four hours later?
I have no comment.
no comment.
come on, guys, I said I have no comment; thank yoU.
Six-charlie to central, I have a 10-33.
requesting bomb squad response. Criminal court.
did you see anyone?
get any threats? - No.
no, nothing.
all right, go.
you think this is related to the russo trial?
maybe.
I mean, but this was just the preliminary hearing.
the real trial is not for months.
detectives?
let's see what we got here.
there are no wires.
no power source. I'm not picking up anything electronic.
it's not a bomb.
it's a puzzle.
what the hell were you thinking, drew?
I mean, this was not cute or funny or the least bit charming.
I told you, I didn't want you to send me any more gifts and I thought I made it perfectly clear that I was not interested.
and then you put this box on my truck?
I called the bomb squad, drew.
it's not from me, stella.
look, every gift i sent to your office was with a card.
you know, there was a theme going on, in case you didn't notice.
a puzzle doesn't exactly say,"take a risk.
you really didn't send this to me.
no, but I do like a good challenge. You want to put it together?
stop touching it.
that looks like blood.
definitely blood.
this puzzle is huge.
I tried to contact the manufacturer, danco, to see if they could, you know, send us a picture of the box or something to help us put it together.
they went out of business six years ago.
great.
found traces of some kind of powder.
no prints so far.
wait a minute.
the diameter of each drop of blood looks like it's less than one millimeter.
high velocity spatter.
it's consistent with a gun shot.
maybe there is a connection to the russo trial.
maybe they were sending some kind of warning.
I don't think so, lindsay.
puzzles just aren't their style.
this needs to be put together right away.
there could be a body out there to go with this blood.
Adam, this is top priority for yoU.
okay.
there was a linear wear pattern on both the leather insoles of the groom's shoes.
possibly orthotics.
they're usually worn to alleviate joint pain, resulting from a faulty gait or posture.
it seems odd, though, that he would take them out before his wedding
all that dancing and standing around.
something else struck me as odd.
the groom's shoes were obviously worn.
if a man's ever going to buy new shoes, it's probably going to be for his wedding.
maybe the groom was wearing someone else's shoes.
which would explain why it appeared that our already-dead groom stepped on a freshly painted curb.
that could only be possible if someone else stepped in the paint, then switched shoes with our groom brett dohn.
and those shoes could belong to our killer.
we sill need to find the primary crime scene.
Brett was last seen around midnight.
Sid puts time of death between 2: 00 and 3: 00.
the groom was stuffed and dressed before being brought to the park.
the killer needed access to pink packing peanuts and bubble wrap...
which are consistent with wedding gifts, most likely delivered directly to the new couple's home.
so the neighbors were very helpful.
they saw nothing, heard nothing and know nothing.
welcome to my life.
looks like this is where the groom was killed.
bride stayed in a hotel last night.
night before the wedding superstition-- the whole bad luck thing.
Yeah, well, if she would've spent the night with her fianc?
she could've been killed as well.
I searched the closets, no orthotics in any of the groom's shoes, proves our theory he was wearing someone else'S.
pink peanuts!
looks like we're missing a wedding gift as well.
got an indentation here.
and where are the clothes the groom was wearing when he was stabbed?
looks like someone tried to clean up.
I saw a garbage truck a couple blocks away.
you better get to that dumpster before they do.
okay, I got this one.
so the little rock i found in the puzzle box, it isn't really a rock.
it's too stratified, so I ran it under the electron microscope.
silicon and oxygen is consistent with quartz.
copper and iron give it its color.
based on the morphology and the elemental composition, our rock is actually petrified redwood.
unfinished, indigenous to northern california.
so what was it doing in the box?
I have no idea.
and there was no other evidence on the box, nothing on the string.
and the plastic that the puzzle came in was made from polyvinyl chloride;
it's probably what the company used to package the puzzle in the first place.
most likely it was opened and then heated to reseal.
right, and the trace that I found on the puzzle piece:
garden variety chalk.
did you find anything from the blood on the puzzle pieces?
not really.
the intensity of the dna profile tells me the blood was fresh, but there's no match to anybody involved in the russo trial.
no match in codis at all.
so I don't get it.
what does petrified redwood have to do with a bloody puzzle?
and why were either of those things left for me?
it's 3-D.
Yeah, that's why the computer couldn't find any matches among the pieces I scanned.
it didn't recognize the algorithm.
it thought it was two-dimensional.
looks like you only have half of a puzzle here. Are you done?
Yeah, that's all he sent.
but you were right about the blood.
the predominant size of each of the stains is less than a millimeter.
definitely high-velocity spatter.
Where's that piece?
I don't know. I looked everywhere, it wasn't in the box.
look again.
you think it has significance?
until we know who that blood belongs to...
I'll look again.
I'll retrace my steps.
I hate puzzles.
so how's your central park wedding?
it's getting stranger by the minute.
Hey, I'll take your strange and raise yoU.
what's going on with the puzzle?
we're missing a piece and we only have half of the entire puzzle.
could this be a case from your past?
someone holding a grudge?
no, you know, I've been racking my brain.
I can't think of anything; there's nothing.
someone's blood is on the puzzle.
this guy isn't playing a game.
let me assign a detail.
no, I'll let you know if I think I need one. Right now, I'm fine.
okay, but keep me in the loop.
always.
listen, I'm missing a piece of the puzzle.
I thought maybe when you pulled some of those piece out, it might've fallen on the floor.
what?
you could've just called. But you're here, so I'm thinking this is your way of apologizing for that wrath I endured earlier today.
and, yes, I accept.
do you mind if I...
feel free to look around.
thank yoU.
could you...
move, yeah.
you know, I can-- I can help you down there if you, uh...
no, I'm fine.
got it.
thank yoU.
I am sorry about earlier.
silver leaf?
Yeah, it was on the groom's phone sid pulled out of his gut.
they used to use silver leaf to gild statues on rooftops, but not so much anymore, although sometimes silver leaf is used in food and drink.
when we processed the scene, the cake was decorated with silver leaf.
that's what made it shine.
the wedding cake was at the park, but the phone was still inside brett before he was redressed and taken there.
so prior to stuffing the groom with the phone, the killer had to come in contact with the cake.
there's really only one person who could've done that before the cake got to the wedding.
my catering business is just getting off the ground.
the dohn-blackstone wedding would've made me a household name.
Why's that?
it's the wedding of the season.
two of new york's most elite families;
the guest list alone would've ensured my employment for the next ten years.
wedding of the season.
so you and brett were college buddies, huh?
how do you think I got the job?
he did me a huge favor.
do you wear orthotics, tim?
What're you, the foot police?
uh, no, no, you can check my shoes. What's this about, anyway?
we checked his phone records.
a year and a half ago, you were calling brett all the time, then up until about three months ago, no contact;
now, all of a sudden, he's calling you every 30 seconds.
Yeah, I ran into him downtown and he offered me the opportunity to cater his wedding, so, of course he's going to call me.
we got reason to believe that you were with brett last night.
no. No, my kid's birthday party was yesterday.
after that, I was cooking.
well, we found silver leaf from the wedding cake on brett's cell phone.
you did make the cake, right?
Yeah, but I use silver leaf for a lot of things.
it's sort of my signature.
Brett and I met a few days back to go over the final checklist.
for the wedding, my phone died and I needed to call one of the vendors, so I used his phone.
silver leaf, it sticks to everything.
when was the last time you were at brett's house?
I don't know-- a few weeks back.
look, you guys are barking up the wrong tree here.
but why would I want to kill the guy who was going to make me a success?
I think I found our missing puzzle piece. - Great!
I think I might've found something, too.
turns out there's only one repository for legally harvested, unfinished redwood in all of new york city: Yalof furniture.
chances are only people who work there would have access to the wood in its unfinished state.
so I had the manager fax over a list of employees.
none of these names ring a bell.
this piece I found obviously doesn't fit.
that's because it's not supposed to.
when a puzzle comes from a manufacturer, it's connected as flat boards through the use of a frame.
the pieces with painted "x" on them, are part of the frame that need to be removed in order to put the puzzle together.
Yeah, learned that the hard way.
but what I also learned is that the puzzle piece we've been looking for isn't actually missing.
it was never in the box to begin with.
when I was looking for it, I hit the surrounding areas with the lcv, and I saw latent blood near the spatter.
so the puzzle was put together with blood spattered on it.
and when the spatter dried, the missing piece was deliberately removed.
had to be.
and the person who removed the piece had blood on their finger, causing the swipe with directionality.
the location the missing piece represents could be very important.
maybe the answer's in that building.
that's what I thought, so I located the actual building on 54th st. Reet now, based on the number of windows on the adjacent pieces,
I think our missing piece is floors 32 through 36.
I contacted building security.
and there was no sign of criminal activity or anything unusual on those floors.
however, 36 has been vacant for the last month and they haven't started showing it yet.
there's another box.
and a satchel and a small chalk outline.
era the hair I found on the groom's bloody shirt...
couldn't get enough genomic dna to run through codis, but it did have a tell-tale knot.
trichonodosis.
hairs can't grow normally, so you end up with knots or bulges within individual hairs.
I checked with sid.
Brett dohn didn't have it, so the hair could've come from our killer.
or anyone who hugged the groom at the rehearsal dinner, or the nightclubs he visited before he was killed, and so on and so on, and that's a lot of suspects.
this might help.
I found an ash-like smudge on the groom's shirt.
traces of potassium, nitrogen, sulfur, carbon, nickel and iron.
pyrotechnics.
iron says they're gold.
and nickel indicates some type of metal, maybe a handle.
I'm thinking gold sparklers.
this time of year?
can't imagine there's too many places we'd find them.
the nightclubs.
I'm thinking I know where he went.
you ever see him before? - No.
he's hot. Who is he?
let's just say he left his bride at the altar in central park and he's never coming back.
might be nothing...
didn't catch a name, but a guy was all over me last night.
I almost burned him with my sparkler.
he said he had to be at his buddy's wedding this morning in the park at like 8: 00, so my refusals were wasting valuable time.
remember what he looked like?
he wasn't bad.
had a shot 'til he opened his mouth.
thank yoU. - Yup.
the wedding was scheduled to start at 11: 00.
if our guy had to be there at 8: 00, must've been in the wedding party.
so we're possibly looking for a killer groomsman with trichonodosis.
chalk used to make the body outline had the exact composition as the chalk I found on the puzzle pieces.
makes sense
I'm trying to find a match to the imprint i found on the satchel.
Hagia sophia?
what is that?
it's a famous building in turkey.
first it was a church, then a mosque.
and now it's a museum.
so how did the pattern get on the satchel?
he could've pressed up against the actual museum.
I have no idea what that satchel was doing with the chalk outline, but I discovered that it's at least 30 years old and it's been discontinued for over two decades.
you know, if the hagia sophia and petrified redwood have no significance to you, maybe this is just coincidence.
even if it means nothing to me personally
someone left forensic evidence, a bloody puzzle, and a trail of clues.
and we're supposed to follow that trail?
the only way to know is to find the guy and ask him.
Oh, I asked detective angell to do a background check on the furniture store employees.
John andrews, day manager.
apparently he moonlights as a pedophile.
puzzles are basically toys.
and toys are the best way to gain a kid's trust.
that's why the chalk outline seemed so small.
we have to check missing persons.
our victim out there could be a kid.
let's go.
Where's the kid, john?
I'm sorry, detective, but I have no idea what you're talking about.
see, along with the puzzle you sent, we found a piece of unfinished petrified redwood, which...
you clearly have access to.
is that how you do it?
you lure them with toys and puzzles?
you want them to like yoU. To trust yoU.
I did my time.
I'm rehabilitated now.
I go to work. I go home. That's it.
I'm sorry, john.
you know, just saying you've recovered doesn't make it so.
I think you want us to stop yoU.
that's why you sent me the puzzle, right?
you're not a monster.
you want us to find that kid before it's too late.
I'm sorry to disappoint you, but there is no kid.
until you can provide us with an adequate alibi, that remains to be seen.
I have an alibi.
I think you know how these work.
track my movements, where I've been, send a signal.
I'd call that an alibi, wouldn't you?
sorry, stella, john andrews isn't your guy.
he was nowhere near the courthouse or the office building.
the ankle bracelet puts him only at work and at home.
but I have something else.
I finished the second half of the puzzle.
there's a second missing piece, 29th floor.
5630 broadway.
the address adam gave me should be right around this corner.
I hate to state the obvious, but there's no building.
is this on purpose, or is our next clue somewhere in all that rubble?
you played the grieving friend so well.
I can't believe it, man.
what are you talking about?
we're giving you a chance to come clean.
consider it a gift.
take a look at that.
you know what this is?
that's a hair.
we found it on your dead friend's bloody shirt.
I'm betting if I take a sample of your hair,
I'm gonna find a knot, just like this one.
you mind handing me your shoe?
your shoe.
you swapped shoes with brett, after you stepped in that yellow paint on the curb.
I had like, 15 shots of tequila.
unfortunately, inebriation isn't a justifiable defense for murder.
murder? No, no, no, no, no way.
after hitting a few bars I went back to brett's apartment and that's when I found him.
I started to call the cops, right, but it's not like there was anything I could do
he was already dead.
I had to get him to the park.
you're gonna have to help us out here, pal.
why did you have to get brett to the park?
it was a bet.
he was engaged twice before, couldn't go through with it.
I bet our buddy toby that brett would definitely show up this time.
there was no way I was gonna lose.
whoa, whoa. You stuffed, dressed and moved your dead friend for a bet?
it was 100 grand, man.
I-I don't have it.
and if I didn't pay up toby would've gone to my dad.
it never occurred to you
what with your friend being dead and all
that just maybe the bet was off?
I told yoU.
Yeah. 15 shots of tequila. I heard yoU.
Yeah, well, it made sense yesterday morning.
I feel bad.
if you knew brett, brett, yeah...
I mean, he, he woulda laughed.
he woulda done the same thing, I'm telling yoU.
that is seriously the stupidest guy I've ever met.
well, maybe, there's no evidence he actually stabbed brett dohn.
you believe his story?
well, if he's telling the truth, when george undressed the already dead groom, sparkler residue from his shirt transferred onto brett's bloody clothes, along with george's knotted hair.
so all we can prove is that george was in the apartment and came into contact with our vic.
means our killer could be him, but it could also be someone else.
hopefully when danny finds that murder weapon, he can tell us exactly who killed brett dohn.
what are you so happy about?
I figured out what killed my groom.
it wasn't the mother-in-law?
no. It was a missing wedding gift.
dental stone mold got me an insignia-- s&s-- and a little house.
Shecktel and sage.
Oh, they sell such amazing stuff.
I'm a-a gift giver.
I still don't actually have the murder weapon, but at least I know what I'm looking for.
and I know that it's one weapon, not three.
since you're having all the luck today, maybe you can help me put together a puzzle, or at least tell me what the green goo is that doc pulled off your groom's pants.
I opened up my big mouth, and then said I could figure it out, and now I'm stuck.
all right, well, what's it worth to you? - 25 bucks?
25? - Yeah.
all right.
it's made with polyvinyl acetate. All right?
which is used in window sealant, textiles and footwear construction.
weird thing is, though, when you look at the scope, it's multicolored.
right?
stretchy bubble plastic.
that stuff's just like silver leaf.
it sticks to everything.
I'm not sure I know what you mean.
puts you at brett's house the night of the murder.
got to hand it to you, though, tim.
last time we spoke, you had all the right answers.
the thing is, most grooms don't call their caterers repeatedly in the middle of the night.
I mean, especially when you're buddies.
I wouldn't take that kind of crap from a friend.
let's see, there's a call at 1: 00 A. M.2: 00 A. M.
three at 5: 00 in the morning.
when he offered me the chance to cater his wedding, I...
right, right, right, you became his punk.
just like you were back in college.
doesn't seem worth it, now, does it?
Yeah, yeah, he treated me like crap in college.
and I took it, all right?
I wrote his papers, I-I watched him steal my girlfriends, but this?
this was going to change my life.
it was the break I'd waited for, it's what I worked so hard for.
but this time, you weren't going to take it anymore, am I right?
all I had to do was make it through the wedding.
that's all I had to do.
and when he called during your son's birthday party, final straw, right?
he wanted a new wedding menu the next day.
he didn't even taste it.
he just said,"let's go back to the original menU.
you're not even going to taste it?
you gotta be kidding me.
Yeah, don't be a whiny bitch.
the kid'll have other birthdays.
go ahead, call me now.
now who's the whiny bitch?
I sold my soul to the devil.
I missed my kid's birthday for nothing.
if you'd seen the look in my kid's eyes when I had to leave his birthday party...
what do you think his eyes are going to look like when he finds out daddy is going away for 25 to life?
thought I should see this puzzle for myself.
it's cool, right?
it was an absolute nightmare to put together.
well, it's not easy to assemble a puzzle without the picture on the box.
and the guy sent it with two missing pieces.
that's the riverton building.
that was my first crime scene.
no way.
this was my first new york apartment.
this to scale?
uh, y-yeah. As-as far as I can tell.
this high-rise should be much taller in relation to the chrysler building.
how-how could you know that?
I got engaged on that roof.
this puzzle's about my life.
Adam, I need the dna results from the blood on the first puzzle.
the guy deliberately removed a piece from two different sections of the puzzle.
he obviously wanted us to go to both places.
maybe he didn't know the second place was gone.
but why would he send us to a building that no longer exists?
because it's not about the buildings.
the missing pieces have significance to my past.
the puzzle's about you?
why would they put it on my truck?
he's using my team to get to me.
what's going on, mac?
I don't know.
but I have no doubt, this has something to do with the 333 caller.
the 333 caller?
it started in london.
I was getting these calls at 3: 33 A. M.
I'd pick up, no one spoke.
I switched hotels, the calls continued.
so you're saying, someone's stalking you?
it goes deeper.
on the return trip, my luggage was stolen.
when I finally received it, I found this inside.
a boy's bloody t-shirt?
to go with the chalk outline of a kid's body.
mac, why didn't you tell me?
I didn't know what it was about.
I still don't, but clearly, he's escalating, and now he's involved yoU.
you tested the blood on the t-shirt?
no match in codis.
I sent it out.
it does, however, bear a striking resemblance to the blood on the first puzzle.
common alleles at 12 of 16 loci.
so the kid who owned the t-shirt and the guy who bled on the puzzle are brothers.
so where do we go now?
the rooftop where I got engaged.
another box, another clue.
just got the lies results on our last rock.
the elemental breakdown is consistent with limestone.
and the stable isotope analysis indicates that it came from the southwestern U. S.
does that mean anything to you, mac?
the alamo.
that's where the limestone is from.
this building is the tribune tower in chicago.
it all makes sense now.
over the years, 136 stones have been added to the tribune tower's ground level from world landmarks, including the redwood forest, hagia sophia...
and the alamo.
how does it feel to be home, detective taylor?
Taxi!
come on. It's beautiful out.
it's freezing.
I want to walk.
Oh, it's beautiful!
Whoo!
look! It's snowing!
it's snowing.
halie, it's freezing outside.
we gotta go!
gotcha!
now you're going to get it.
run!
owner of the Dorothea Hotel. Yep.
the Wicked Witch of the Upper East Side.
her reputation precedes her.
that's quite a snow scene for the driest winter on record.
it's Fiona's tax-deductible gift to the city.
she does it every year.
who found her?
couple over there was doing the mistletoe dance.
said the platform just gave way.
swear they didn't know she was there.
signs of early-onset rigor.
T. O.D?
maybe six hours, give or take.
lovebirds called in the platform collapse about two hours ago.
so she was dead before the castle crushed her.
looks like a puncture wound here.
penetration looks deep; could be a stab wound.
if she was stabbed, it seems odd there isn't more blood.
I can't believe it.
they applauding?
they're applauding.
I guess the question isn't who would want to kill Fiona Chisolm...
but who wouldn't?
the killer caught a break with these snow machines.
the hotel keeps them on 24-7.
they ruin any chance of finding a discernable footprint.
chain on this looks like it was cut.
maybe from a purse? Could be.
is that a print?
looks like it. Maybe from our killer?
l- shaped drip pattern to the chest wound.
blood drip starts one direction, then changes course.
this is a dump job.
so not only do we need to find who murdered her, we need to find out where.
bus driver said he got distracted when a couple of kids were fighting.
knock it off, you two!
cab stopped short in front of him.
driver says she came out of nowhere.
it's the middle of winter. What's she doing outside in her nightgown, with no shoes on?
running from someone, something?
the body's nearly frozen.
any witnesses?
no one saw her before the accident.
it's as if she suddenly appeared out of nowhere.
where did she come from?
you got something?
the answer to your question.
she slid off the bus.
where did she fall from?
Wendy? Could be her name.
I'll run it and a description through Missing Persons.
last name would have been nice.
crushed flowers?
during the black plague, perfumed flowers were stuffed into the pockets of those who perished...
to mask the smell of death.
so that would make this... "a pocket full of posies.
ashes, ashes...
we all fall down.
I checked with the bus company.
as far as they know, this bus was parked in the lot all weekend.
there are no buildings adjacent to the property, so she didn't fall there.
there's a space between the roof and the inside ceiling.
that's why there's no dent on the inside.
these things are like tin cans.
there's no soundproofing or insulation.
Yeah, well, then, why didn't the bus driver hear her land?
Danny, I... I heard about the Sandoval shooting.
kid lived in your building.
his name was Ruben.
kid was only ten years old.
I'm sorry.
that look familiar to you?
Yeah, it's the same one our vic was wearing.
wait. She was on top of the bus and inside?
who might just be the proud owner of this baseball cap.
I'm thinking that's blood.
it's too big, though, to belong to a kid or our vic.
well, then, whose hat is it?
your scene assessment was correct.
the crush injuries didn't exhibit bleeding.
she was dead before the house- castle- fell on her.
any defense wounds?
bruise here on the wrist.
most likely caused by someone tugging on the purse strap we found.
could be looking at a robbery.
that thief went to a lot of trouble to steal a purse.
Fiona wasn't only crushed, but stabbed and burned as well.
contact burn.
any idea what stabbed her?
wound morphology was compromised by the crush injuries.
so the official cause of death was stabbing or burning?
neither.
her skin shows little evidence of freezing, which is in stark contrast to the condition of her iernal organs, namely h heart.
I'm assuming the stab injury must be related, and I'm not sure how it happened, but C. O.D. is acute cardiac failure due to freeze trauma.
Fiona Chisolm died from a frozen heart.
the partial print we found on Fiona's collarbone
it wasn't a fingerprint. It was a nose print.
a dog nose print. The DNA came back canine.
specifically, a Norwich Terrier.
so I called the Dorothea Hotel, and Fiona owned a terrier named Otto.
nobody reported seeing the dog at the scene.
maybe it got spooked, and ran off. Or was snatched.
despite the lizard skin and platinum chain,
I don't think this is a handle from a purse.
found traces of the pesticide Imidacloprid, commonly used as a flea repellent for pets.
I'm thinking this handle is from a leash.
dognapping?
could be. Chain looks cut.
odd thing is, there are no tool marks.
trying to figure out what could have snapped a platinum chain clean in half.
that dog could have traces of our killer on him.
okay. I'll call all the animal shelters, see if anybody picked him up.
right. In the meantime, if Fiona was walking her dog when she was killed, we need to find out where that walk started. Yep.
chestnuts! Hot chestnuts!
we got hot chestnuts.
get 'em while they're hot.
one bag, please.
there ya go. Yes, well, somehow, as concierge, walking Otto became a duty of mine.
but not last night?
I went to go and get the dog from Fiona, but she was behind closed doors screaming at some guy.
she ended up dead, and you didn't think a heated argument was worth reporting?
heated arguments were as much a part of Fiona's day as breathing.
I knocked, she screamed at me to go away, so I left.
well, where were you for the rest of the night?
I left work at 6: 00, then I went to the Double Crow Pub on 37th.
I'm there every night.
guess tonight I'll be knocking back a few for poor old Fiona.
you don't seem very broken up over her death.
the rumors about how mean she is- they're all true.
anyone could have killed her except for me.
Where's Fiona's office?
wicked.
bristles are positive for blood.
broken broom, knocked over pictures, smashed lamp, it all points to a struggle.
so who is the guy Fiona was screaming at behind closed doors?
not keeping you busy enough, Sid?
uh, actually, your Wendy inspired a little research.
any of it lead to C. O.D?
Yes, well, this one's a real cliffhanger.
okay, when my tech tested your vic's body temperature at the scene, it was 70 degrees.
adjusting for the extreme weather conditions,
I'm estimating she was killed eight to nine hours before you found her.
which makes time of death just after midnight.
Mm-hmm.
and while her broken bones are consistent with the damage caused by the impact of the bus and taxi, her was caused by exsanguination, due to the transecting of the right inferior mesenteric artery.
bled out through the abdomen.
but it was the manner by which the wounds were inflicted that baited my interest.
both wound tracks revealed curvature.
she was killed with a hook?
or a hook-like instrument.
from the semen I found, she had sex shortly before she died.
nothing to indicate it was anything but consensual.
what's that? A fairy.
it's from a small red impression
I found behind her right shoulder.
any idea what caused it?
no idea, but which brings me to my research.
a fairy,
Wendy in a nightgown, killed by a sharp curved instrument.
makes one wonder ????
any luck identying the vic?
angell checked with Missing Persons.
nothing that matches our Jane Doe, including the name "Wendy" or anything else.
based on the vic's weight and depth of impact, it appears she fell 35 feet.
it's about a three-story drop, so our primary crime scene would be a building that's 35 feet or higher.
leaves about every structure in Manhattan.
Adam's processing the rest of the evidence.
maybe he found something that can help us narrow down the search.
the name written on the vic's chest,"Wendy,
was written in a water-based acrylic.
finger paint?
and the clay that Sid found under her fingernails had a mixture of wheat flour, deodorized kerosene, salt, borax and alum- otherwise known as "kiddie clay.
mm, starting to see a theme here.
and the star that was stuck to her forehead had a partial.
it was a match to a print that Sid found in the finger paint.
it didn't match the vic and there was no hits in AFIS.
so we got finger paints, kiddie clay and a gold star, items that might be found in a kindergarten class or a toy store.
our vic was murdered and dumped from 35 feet.
there's not a lot of kindergartens or toy stores with three stories in a 20-mile radius of where our vic was found.
toy stores and schools are the last places
I want to be looking for a killer right now.
based on the arts-and-crafts trace you found on the vic,
I did some checking.
been a rash of kindergarten break-ins.
this one just last night.
we're on the third floor.
with a parking lot below.
big enough to park a bus.
so our perp lifts a school bus from where they park the buses and then returns it with a dead body on the roof?
looks like we got our evidence right here.
school security didn't think it was a big deal.
a few tables and chairs were knocked over, nothing was stolen.
who breaks into a kindergarten classroom?
same M. O. at the other schools.
perp left the place a mess.
nothing was missing.
he's been doing that a lot lately.
I didn't know Mars had sunspots.
if I remember correctly, sunspots don't have directionality- Danny.
is it blood?
Yeah.
could be cast-off.
killer did a good job cleaning up, if that's all he missed.
let's find out.
based on the amount of blood,
I'd say we were in the right place.
got gravitational blood drops over here.
got a hidden book over here.
it's got some handwritten numbers in the back and it's not from this classroom.
it's from the public library.
think we found our murder weapon.
this make sense to anybody?
the way I remember it,
Peter Pan was about a fantasy, not about a murder.
Hey, Stella... Yeah?
what do Pakistan and Nigeria and Afghanistan have in common?
Oh, do I really want to know?
polio and meningitis, for which you get vaccinated when you travel to those countries.
now, I got the results back from the blood on the broom.
male, human, no hits in CODIS, but there were antibodies in the blood, and the high level suggests the donor was inoculated with a vaccine sometime in the past two weeks.
male blood.
right. Now, I had Flack cross-reference a list of people who've been immunized in the past two weeks with Fiona's known associates.
we found a connection.
Harrison Green, MD.
he's the founder of Heartsage International.
it's a children's charity, and up till now,
Fiona's been their biggest donor, but guess what.
this year, she didn't make a donation.
maybe Dr. Green tried to change her mind.
I had a meeting with Fiona, but I didn't attack her.
we were friends, good friends.
my friends don't play broomball with my face.
I play rugby. It's a tough sport.
Dr. Green, we can match every bristle to every scratch, not to mention the blood.
the woman was insane.
if she wasn't one of my biggest donors,
I'd have nothing to do with her.
well, she wasn't one of your biggest donors this year.
I wanted the money she promised me;
us, the children of Nigeria.
Fiona, don't cut us off! Let go of me!
don't cut us off! Let go of me...
do you always resort to physical altercations when soliciting donations?
when it's something I'm passionate about, sure.
I have a heart.
isn't that what charity's all about?
not when your charity's flagged by the IRS.
seems that a percentage of the funds that you're collecting to immunize children is actually going towards the construction of your Lake Como home.
Yeah, I'm guessing that all your trips to Nigeria were strictly for photo ops, prove you're legit.
Fiona suspected that you were a fraud and stopped writing you checks.
I have other investors.
none as powerful as Fiona Chisholm.
all she had to do was pick up the phone, call the papers and you'd be finished.
unless you have the evidence, to arrest me,
I think you're finished.
any luck finding the dog?
not yet.
but his broken leash is another story.
since I couldn't figure out what could've cut the leash without leaving tool marks,
I decided to take a closer look.
I found...
a repetitive pattern with a break along a single plane, which means the metal was extremely brittle.
like it was frozen. Yeah.
it's definitely a match.
liquid nitrogen snapped the leash.
and I'm thinking it's also what caused
Fiona's heart to freeze.
you know, the shape and diameter of the stab wound...
...could be consistent...
with the nozzle of a liquid nitrogen tank.
allowing direct access to her heart.
now, a tank nozzle is very blunt, so the killer must've used tremendous force to push it all the way through Fiona's cardiac wall.
there are liquid nitrogen tanks on street corners all over the city.
the utility companies use them to maintain power lines and reduce corrosion.
you know what else liquid nitrogen is used for?
snow machines.
LN2, pressurized air and water
instant winter fun.
landscape supply company responsible for the snow said this is where they store all the tanks they use during the week.
Hey, this nozzle's bent.
positive for blood.
looks like we found our murder weapon.
there's something stuck to this valve.
looks like skin from a finger.
who touches a liquid nitrogen tank without gloves?
maybe the force of Fiona's body hitting the tank caused it to fall.
the jarring would have allowed a few blasts, more than enough to kill her.
and if the nozzle was on the ground, the LN2 could've easily reached the leash.
so the killer got Fiona.
and her little dog, too.
Hey, boss.
I got some information on the baseball cap you guys found on the school bus.
hmm, blood on the bill matched our Jane Doe.
the DNA from the band had shared male alleles at 12 out of 16 loci with the vic's reference sample.
so it's our Jane Doe's brother and he's not in our system.
what about the hat's logo?
it belongs to Stanwell and Linford.
it's a brokerage firm on Wall Street.
gentlemen, get this straight.
right now I have 20 interns and only one of you is getting a job.
so if you want to get my attention, you're gonna have to give more than 110 percent.
first order of business is getting your asses down to the tenth floor for drug testing.
nurse Ratchet is waiting.
now move.
Mr. Wright, NYPD Crime Lab.
we'd like to talk to you.
it's about your sister.
your receptionist recognized her.
her name's Leslie.
you know where Leslie was last night?
we had dinner.
left the restaurant around 10: 00.
Leslie said she was going to a party.
I hailed her a taxi.
that was the last time I saw her.
whose party was it?
I should've asked. I have no idea.
did your sister have a boyfriend?
if she did, I would've been the last to know.
I guess that's what you get for being an overprotective big brother.
Mr. Wright...
we found a baseball cap we believe belongs to you, bears your company's logo and was found inside the same school bus where your sister's body was found.
was Leslie wearing it last night?
not when we were together.
you have to find out who did this.
please tell me you'll get the person who did this.
Oh. Hey.
that was a nice move.
what is this, Dancing with the Scientists?
no, it's more like a Wu-Tang with a little heel-toe action.
Oh, yeah.
moving right along.
I used the structural data from the RI along with the molecular weight I pulled from the GCMS to I. D. the pill you found in the classroom.
it's methoxy diisopropyltryptamine, also known as "Foxy.
an intense high with an abrupt comedown.
the latest in high-end designer drugs.
makes ecstasy look like aspirin.
and users claim it induces this childlike wonder.
LSD with a twist.
and...
the tox results confirm that our vic had Foxy in her system.
so your Wendy was flying high at T. O.D.
question is, who was her copilot?
Hey, Mac, I pulled a bunch of prints off the Peter Pan book, but nothing hit in AFIS, and there's nothing that puts the brother at the scene.
but here's that page of numbers I found in the back of the book.
now, they're all five digits.
the first two are sequential.
Yeah, they're text numbers, so, when you send a text, a few seconds later, this is what comes back to you.
Alice will see you at 11: 30
tonight at Dunhill.
dunhill is one of those pricey private kindergarten schools on the Upper East Side.
but who the hell is Alice?
so who touches a liquid nitrogen tank without gloves?
Hey, I got prints from the skin that was on the liquid nitrogen tank.
no hits in AFIS, so I cast a wider net.
found something in Homeland Security.
Hey, our good friend Tina O'Donovan, the concierge.
she entered this country from Ireland on a work visa three years ag
sponsored by?
the Dorothea Hotel.
but here's the best part.
she was fired two days ago.
wait, so if Tina was fired before Fiona was killed, what made her show up for work this morning?
when I found out Fiona was gone and no one else knew that she'd fired me...
you figured you'd keep working.
it made sense to me.
look, I told you
I was at the Double Crow pub all night.
so you want to explain why your DNA is on the murder weapon?
we found a piece of your finger on the nitrogen tank.
because she told me to fix it.
the snowman is melting.
it's melting.
what am I supposed to do?
it's my pleasure, Ms. Chisolm.
Ow.
look, I've got a brain. I'm not stupid.
I knew surviving Fiona meant I could write my own ticket in this town.
why would I tear that in half?
looks like we're in the right place.
this party is invitation only.
left mine at home.
Where'd you get that bruise?
Oh, this.
few nights ago.
mad party.
mad.
apparently, the party's going on 247 in your head.
I... I can't explain myself,
I'm afraid, sir, because I'm not myself.
you see?
Yeah, well...
whoever you are...
you have the right to remain silent.
let's go.
sorry to kill your trip, but why a kindergarten?
it's wildgarten, man.
that's just another name for getting high with your friends.
look, it's all kept under the radar.
invites are small.
we each get a book with text numbers, tell us when and where we're supposed to be.
the party begins.
the Foxy, man...
makes the game real.
turns Manhattan into Neverland.
except nobody dies in Neverland.
this is the weapon that was used to kill Leslie Wright.
and the bruise on your hand is consistent with the shape of this weapon and the amount of force that would've been needed to kill her.
wait a minute, I didn't kill her.
see, I got evidence that says otherwise.
I barely knew this girl.
Bryce, I got you for breaking and entering.
and according to all your friends here, you were the one that stole that bus.
I had a summer job cleaning school buses.
I kept some of the keys.
I only borrowed them for a few hours.
still doesn't explain that bruise.
look, we were just messing around.
I was pretending with my buddy Elliot.
I don't know what happened to the hook after I dropped it.
somebody stuck it into Leslie Wright's stomach a couple times.
it wasn't me. Let me explain this to you in a way you might understand.
forget Neverland
you got to grow up and that's going to be behind bars serving a life sentence for murder.
this is Otto?
Yes.
Hi, Otto.
how you doing?
Fiona couldn't be too bad; her dog is friendly.
Where'd you find him?
salesman at a bike shop found him in a basket.
he was going to take him home to Red Hook, till he saw the news, called the precinct.
he didn't give him a bath, did he? Nope.
for the past 24 hours, this pampered pooch has been slumming it.
all right, Otto...
Hey, guys. What do we got?
DNA from the blood on Otto's mouth came back human.
no I. D.but it's male.
now, the dog was gone for almost 24 hours.
it means the blood could belong to anyone.
what about the collar?
trace came back as searic, palmitic and linoleic acid.
it's commonly found in chestnuts.
roasted to be exact.
there were also traces of charcoal.
and the burn pattern on Fiona's neck could be consistent with the grill on a chestnut cart.
so that's how Fiona was transferred from the primary crime scene to the front of the hotel.
I had Flack pull all vendor licenses.
there's only one in the area with a permit to sell near the Dorothea.
name's Felix Hall.
two weeks ago, he filed an appeal.
seems someone was trying to pull his license and kick him to another corner.
let me guess: Fiona.
Yeah, but those are rotten, man.
just pull the top away.
that'll be fine. Yeah, it's still good.
this is just wrong.
seriously, no New Yorker should ever see this.
ever.
look, you can always put in for psych leave.
Hey, Felix Hall?
NYPD.
we got a couple questions to ask you, nut man.
starting with: which cart is yours?
Why? What's going on?
Hey, hey, wait, what do you think you're doing?
I just cleaned this thing.
positive for blood...
and this looks like skin.
looks like you've been roasting more than chestnuts in this thing, Felix.
put your hands behind your back.
you're under arrest for the murder of Fiona Chisolm.
you okay?
no, I'm not.
I don't think I'm ever going to be the same.
????
you have your corner- five feet by five feet, a kingdom, right? but it m might as well be
prime spot
but then Fiona decides to take it all away. What was it?
she didn't like the way your awning looked, or maybe she just didn't like the smell of chestnuts in the morning.
we got your DNA off thdog, Felix.
did he bite you before or after you killed Fiona?
the only thing I'm guilty of is having the courage to stand up to her.
ms. Chisolm, please... I need this corner.
there are hundreds of corners in this city.
feel free to set up on any one of them but mine... Ms. Chisolm, wait...
she pushed you too far.
so you decided to push back.
Hey!
you did it, Felix.
and you used your cart to move the body.
and you figured between her employees and all the people in the street, there's be too many suspects to count, right?
the blood we found inside your cart and the skin from the burner, it was positive for Fiona's DNA.
all that woman cared about was herself.
she didn't know what it was like for real people. So you decided she needed somebody to put her in her place.
teaching someone a lesson only works if they're still alive to learn it.
the DNA I got off the hook wasn't a match to Bryce Aldicott.
but when I compared it to other case samples, it was a match to another donor on the hat.
which puts that hat on someone besides the brother.
maybe it was seone else at the brokerage firm.
except we can't just go around asking for DNA samples.
we don't have to.
the first order of business is getting your asses down to the tenth floor for drug testing.
Stanwell and Linford drug tested their employees yesterday.
all we have to do is subpoena the test samples for DNA.
Congratulations. You deserve it. Good luck.
have a seat, Tyler.
pretty dog-eat-dog world around here, huh?
what, like out of 20 interns only one of you guys get the job, right?
we got some bad news.
uh, what is this, about the drug test?
you could say that.
you tested positive.
for what?
murder.
DNA puts you with Leslie Wright the night she was killed.
she was high, but then, you knew that, didn't you?
psychedelic hallucinogen found in her system lowers inhibitions, makes the user more susceptible to sexual advances.
so when you got her alone,
Leslie Wright was yours for the taking.
we were both high.
no, no, not so much.
you see, the rio of metabolites to parent compounds from the drug test you took tells us you were sober.
you want to know what that means?
you took advantage of a young woman under the influence of a narcotic.
all right, so I wasn't high.
so what?
the bottom line is she didn't say no.
call it whatever you want...
we call it rape.
I'm guessing so did Leslie.
the drug's effects have a short life span.
look, she wanted me.
then it was like she just snapped.
how could you do this to me?! Stop! No, stop!
no, stop! You're sick! Get off of me!
so what happened?
did she threaten to go to the cops?
or go straight to big brother?
stop! Stop! Get off of me!
I'm telling my brother!
get up.
do you believe this?
Fiona's real name was Lorraine Gail, from Topeka, Kansas.
she left home at 19.
found work at the Dorothea as a maid to make ends meet while she got her MBA.
its employees were the only family she had.
announcer: This is New York Crime Catchers.
tonight, the New York City Police Department is asking for your help.
approximately six weeks ago, at 11: 30 p. m.
Cheryl Miller was leaving a New York dance club and on her way home.
it was at this time that she was approached by a female suspect who pulled a gun and fired upon the victim, killing her instantly.
the suspect is also believed to be responsible for the murders of Judge Daniel McHenry, a resident of New Jersey, and New York representative, Congressman Philip Devane.
the suspect is a white female, five foot eight, 110 pounds, with medium-length blond hair.
if you have any information about this case, call the New York Crime Catchers tip line at:
remember, every call is confidential.
man: Crime Catchers. How can I help you?
woman: I saw her!
the blond woman the police are looking for, I know where she is.
this building's been vacant for over two years.
new York Power Corp detected an abnormal usage spike from an adjacent building.
someone's piggybacking off their neighbor's electric service.
this tip looks like the real deal.
perimeter is locked down-- we're good to go.
all right, listen up.
we'll be entering the building from a side location, here.
this will be our primary access and egress point-- and I want radio silence.
our suspect is technologically sophisticated.
TAYLOR: Make no mistake, this woman will be armed and very dangerous.
she's a shooter-- killing is nothing more than an instinct.
during our last pursuit, I saw her cut down an unarmed civilian without blinking an eye.
so she will not think twice about putting a bullet in you.
play it smart.
perimeter's clear.
man, that's brutal.
is this Suspect X?
FLACK: Mac, you were the only one to come face-to-face with her.
she just knocked on my door. I...
I don't know who she is.
please...
let me go.
Yeah.
it's her.
BONASERA: Hey, guys, it's gonna be another minute.
any luck?
negative. Hard drive's been wiped clean.
see if you can find any foreign prints.
maybe whatever was on these laptops is something to die for.
you okay?
what are you thinking?
this woman was a skilled and trained assassin.
whoever did this... had to be better.
BONASERA: Who kills a professional killer?
SID: Your murder weapon.
Six-and-a-half-inch, black powder coated blade, sawtooth back.
this is a Navy SEAL combat knife.
now, if only there was a game show that called for that kind of knowledge, you'd be able to retire early.
I'd miss your wit.
and your keen sense of observation
speaking of which...
uh, that knife you're holding was used to inflict these stab wounds.
they're shallow.
deliberate but nonlethal.
she endured a tremendous amount of pain.
she was also suffering from acute dehydration.
her muscles showed signs of atrophy.
and take a look at these.
on the surface, they appear to be minor abrasions, but in fact...
they're bedsores.
exactly.
aged linear bruising.
looks like she was bound for an extended period of time.
I was getting to that, Mac-- you're stealing my thunder.
see?
her legs as well.
she struggled hard.
now, this looks to be an injection site.
I'm waiting for tox to come back to determine if she was drugged, but I'm guessing she was held captive for a long time, tortured, and possibly drugged.
any theories? This woman murdered people for a living;
she was highly skilled;
she probably trained to endure torture.
whatever her killer was after, she didn't give it up easily.
or give it up at all. Anything else?
I thought you'd never ask.
this may be the most perplexing thing about this case.
these metal screws were inserted during a cosmetic forehead lift.
and take a look at these, uh, healed fractures, uh, inflicted during a surgical procedure to alter the nose.
my autopsy also revealed remnants of scarring from an eye lift, genioplasty, and skin layer erosion therapy.
and all of this work was performed within the last couple of months.
our vic was a master of disguise-- maybe cosmetic surgery was another elaborate way to conceal her identity.
how are you at... reverse engineering?
I don't like the sound of this. Sid, if you can rebuild her face to what it may have looked like before the surgery, it might help ID her.
knowing who this woman is will help us find her enemies...
and who might have wanted her dead.
you get any prints off the laptops? Nothing usable.
knife give us anything?
here. Take a peek.
I found it in the handle.
a ball bearing?
with minute traces of dried blood on the surface.
looks like shrapnel...
from an improvised explosive device.
soldiers wounded in action sometimes...
keep the shrapnel that's pulled from their bodies.
it's like a little reminder of how close they came to dying.
get any prints off the knife?
wiped clean-- but I did find some dried blood in the crevice between the hilt and the handle.
I sent both samples to DNA.
so if the owner of the knife was wounded in action, he or she would be the recipient of a Purple Heart.
are you saying our killer could be a war hero?
Hey, Linds.
they're beautiful.
nothing says "You're special
like centrifuge tubes filled with DNA samples.
I'm not gonna live this down, am I? Forgetting my birthday?
probably not.
where did you get these?
Adam found more blood samples on the knife.
there was a piece of shrapnel hidden inside the handle.
did you run the blood he found on the hilt?
Yep. Came back nonhuman.
I sent it to Serology for a protein analysis.
Lindsay, come on.
uh, guys, we're not wired for remembering dates, okay?
we remember sports stats and steak sides
that's our thing, all right?
steak sides?
you are so busted.
detective Monroe? Thanks.
DNA from the knife came back to a white-tailed deer, common to the forests of the northeastern United States.
wasn't one of Suspect X's victims on a hunting trip in Jersey when he was killed?
monroe: Yeah. Judge Daniel McHenry.
and we also found evidence of a white-tailed deer infected with Lyme disease at that crime scene.
so... if our new blood sample has Lyme disease, then it's possible that our murder weapon was at that same location.
boom. What about the blood on the shrapnel
did that come back deer or human?
human. I'll run it through CODIS.
all right. While you do that,
I will run the blood from the knife and see if Bambi is infected with Lyme disease.
BONASERA: Hey, what's the rush?
an old friend of mine from the Marine Corps,
general Finn, provided me with a list of Navy SEALs who were recipients of the Purple Heart who were wounded in combat from IED or a car bomb.
I bet that's a pretty exclusive list.
exclusive enough that we may have identified the owner of the knife that killed Suspect X:
judge McHenry's son?
the blood we found on the murder weapon was from a white-tailed deer that tested positive for Lyme disease.
then we can place Russ McHenry's knife at the scene of his father's murder.
the same knife that killed Suspect X.
and the answer to the question:
who is capable of murdering a professional killer?
a Navy SEAL with a killer motive.
look, Detectives, I'm really busy.
I got a garage full of cars.
why don't we skip this Interrogation 101 crap and get right to the point?
you still have the Navy SEAL combat knife that was issued to you when you joined your unit?
I gave it to my father to gut his deer the day he was killed.
that's the last time I saw it.
well, it just turned up.
stuck in the back of a dead woman's skull.
we think she's the person responsible for your father's murder.
well, when you catch her killer, be sure to thank him for me.
Mr. McHenry, whoever killed her was highly skilled.
this person was able to render a trained assassin helpless and then torture and murder her, presumably all by himself.
a person capable of that could have had extensive military training.
what do you think?
what do I think?
I'm not gonna let you stand here and accuse me of murder.
we're not accusing you. We're trying to understand how your knife ended up at our crime scene.
you're disappointed, Detective.
I can see it in your eyes.
come here expecting a big strong Navy SEAL killing machine.
instead, you get half a soldier.
what I see is motive.
what do you know?
more than you think.
don't you dare pity me.
it ain't pity, Russ.
I'm just trying to figure out if you could have done it.
what, 'cause of these?
20 different ways, Detective, trust me.
but come on.
leaving my knife behind?
that's sloppy.
if you know anything about Navy SEALs, we're not sloppy.
I'll tell you this, though.
if I would have known who killed my father, yeah, I would have done it.
tox results came back on Suspect X.
we found traces of morphine and propofol in her system.
veterinarians use propofol to anesthetize animals.
lab also detected traces of Ringer's solution in her blood, which makes sense because the vic was suffering from acute hypertonicity.
a complication associated with long-term intravenous feeding.
explains the puncture mark Sid found on Suspect X's hands.
and her bedsores and muscle atrophy.
she was in bed for a long time.
still doesn't explain why our killer drugged her, fed her intravenously and then held her hostage over a long period of time.
it just doesn't make sense.
actually, it does if the woman we found in the warehouse is not Suspect X.
using the cosmetic surgery data Sid culled from the autopsy,
I was able to deconstruct our victim's face coming up with a pre-surgery composite.
how do we know that's not what our hired killer looked like before the surgery?
because I ran the composite through our missing person's database, and this is what I found.
boom. Her name is Katie Mann.
six weeks ago, she disappeared under suspicious circumstances.
suspect X specifically targeted Katie Mann because she closely resembled her.
the surgery made them identical.
so she kidnaps, tortures and kills an innocent girl to fake her own death.
Yeah, means our, uh, female assassin is still alive.
but why go through all that trouble to make us believe she's dead?
cause every law enforcement agency in the country's looking for her.
if she dies, her homicide cases die, too.
suddenly, she's free.
free to kill again.
woman: Dignitary protection is your number-one priority.
the mayor will be led on and off the stage from that stairway.
um, as for final numbers, it's still unknown, but you can be assured tomorrow's Green rally will be one of the largest outdoor gatherings in New York history.
you two know each other?
we met last year at a charity event in Gracie Mansion.
Gracie Mansion, huh?
couple months after we met, her estranged husband began stalking her.
she made a special request of the chief.
and you took care of it. Yeah.
you know, I' never even had an old lady ask me to help her cross the street.
woman: Magnetometers will be set up at every entryway, but that doesn't mean that anyone in this detail feels that they can relax.
you will have to be on your toes.
I want that site report and threat assessment on my desk before the puck drops tonight.
once the Rangers hit the ice, I'm off the clock.
and that's it.
you got a lot of work to do, gentlemen.
get to it.
detective Don Flack, Jordan Gates, the mayor's criminal justice coordinator.
pleasure. Same.
it's good to see you again, Detective Taylor.
the Crime Lab back in one piece?
I don't know what strings you pulled, but it seemed to happen overnight.
well, I figured I owed you one.
the mayor, however, he didn't see it the same way.
he said, next time you want to blow up your Crime Lab, it's gonna come out of your paycheck.
what can I do for you today, Detectives?
ms. Gates, you filed a missing persons report on your former assistant Katie Mann.
uh, yeah, about six weeks ago. Why?
I'm afraid we have some bad news.
FLACK: Last night she was found murdered in an abandoned warehouse downtown.
Oh, my God.
I'm sorry.
Katie's like a little sister to me.
She-she didn't have any family.
jordan, I know this is difficult, but we do need to ask you a few questions.
of course.
what can you tell me about the day Katie disappeared?
nothing out of the ordinary.
she came to work, she told me she was gonna go out that night to a club.
uh, Random.
it's downtown.
a cosplay club, right?
it's where people dress like avatars?
Yeah, that's right.
she loved going there.
you know the place?
Katie wasn't the killer's first victim.
a woman named Cheryl Miller was murdered a couple of months ago following a night out at that same club.
Katie say she was gonna meet anyone-- boyfriend, girlfriend?
no, she always went alone.
when she didn't show up for work the next day, you know, I just figured she had a late night.
and then when I didn't hear from her the following day, that's when I filed the missing persons report.
what does this place remind you of?
I have no idea.
star Wars cantina.
right, right.
the bar Luke went to on Mos Eisley.
Absolutely.
man: How can I help you, Officers?
how do you know this isn't a costume?
give me a break, man.
you recognize any of these women, cowboy?
Yeah, they're regulars. Haven't seen them in a while.
I think this one's name is Katie.
what about the other one?
no idea.
served her a couple times. Didn't really say much.
where is that coming from?
I got no idea.
someone's hacked into the system, man.
I don't know.
man: Ladies and gentlemen, my name is Detective Taylor and I'm with the New York Crime Lab.
the NYPD needs your help tonight to bring to justice a fugitive.
what the...?
it's Suspect X.
she knows we're here.
she could be here.
anyone holding a mobile device.
woman: Detectives, the hunt for me is futile.
why are you wasting your time chasing shadows like a nightmare that won't go away?
I will continue to evolve
woman AND MAN: while you and your cop friends chase their tails and mop up the blood.
I now return to your regularly scheduled party.
she's watching us.
the call Suspect X made to Crime Catchers originated from a throwaway cell phone.
no other calls were made and it's been turned off.
what about pulling up some of the background noise from the 911 tape?
that could determine where she made the call from.
done. No acoustic anomalies to work with.
Hey, anyone for good news?
please.
monroe: The custom-made bone screws that Sid pulled from the victim's skull were made by a company called Unlimited Titanium.
they were special ordered, coated in titanium.
a Park Avenue plastic surgeon by the name of Joseph Kirkbaum placed the order about two years ago.
suspect X kidnapped Katie Mann to alter her face.
what would make a high-end cutter like Kirkbaum complicit in something like that?
his license was revoked a year ago for malpractice.
he went into the undertaking business.
now, get this.
Lori Hess, the woman responsible for Kirkbaum having his license pulled by the state, was found shot to death in her Florida condominium two months ago.
one round to the back of the head.
okay, well, Kirkbaum had to be a suspect.
he was, but he had an airtight alibi.
he was in New York when she was ventilated.
but that doesn't mean he wasn't involved.
the Hess murder had all the earmarks of a contract killing.
the slug that the Miami Crime Lab found at the scene had striation marks consistent with the use of a silencer.
so Kirkbaum hires Suspect X to pull the trigger, and to repay the favor, he performs plastic surgery on Katie Mann.
only one way to find out.
what?
you look good in a vest.
what's it look like?
Kirkbaum's car is parked out front.
snooped around-- doesn't look like anyone's home, but the basement door was unlocked.
you bring anything else?
all-access pass. Nice.
you guys take the downstairs, we'll hit the upstairs.
all right.
so much for sterile conditions.
joseph Kirkbaum... NYPD.
you ready?
NYPD!
this is definitely where Kirkbaum held Katie Mann.
and where he surgically altered her appearance to make her look like Suspect X.
looks like we found our doctor.
Oh, he's dead.
Tod can't be more than eight hours ago.
what is that in his eye?
it's like... some sort of camera.
monroe: Danny, she's watching us.
not anymore.
I got nothing.
hard drive's been wiped clean.
this girl is really good at hiding her tracks.
but was Kirkbaum?
I'm going to have Flack subpoena his e-mail account, his phone records, any computers he had access to over the last six months.
we've got to focus on hardware outside this location.
and if Kirkbaum hired Suspect X, he must have left an electronic footprint behind.
monroe: Hey, Danny.
Yeah. There's high-velocity blood spatter on these coveralls.
Kirkbaum had a close contact wound to the face.
suspect X must have been wearing these when she executed him.
got something in one of the pockets.
it's a strange consistency.
let's get it over to Hawkes.
whatever it is, if Suspect X had it in her coveralls, it could explain what the hell is going on.
the bullet recovered from Kirkbaum's skull came from a . 45.
same caliber Suspect X uses.
once she knew we were on to her, she killed Kirkbaum to tie up any loose ends.
but why leave behind a camera in his eye?
it's her way of looking over her shoulder to see how far behind we are.
Mac... Don't tell me, Adam, you broke the case.
all I got to say is remember today when I put in for a raise.
detective Flack came through with those subpoenas.
I'm going through all of Kirkbaum's electronic communications.
I've been focusing on everything to and from the good doctor leading up to and after the Lori Hess murder.
And?
what you're about to see is a series of e-mails between Kirkbaum and his attorney.
it seems like Kirkbaum was angry about Hess refusing to settle out of court or drop the complaint she filed against him with the State Medical Board.
really threatening stuff.
a few minutes after the exchange...
Kirkbaum received an instant message from someone using a newly created untraceable e-mail account that emanated from inside an Internet cafe in Soho.
and the message simply read:
????????????
Kirkbaum didn't find Suspect X.
she found him and offered her services for a price.
Yeah. And she found him using a recursive spider.
it's an Internet mining program that searches instant messages and e-mails for key words and phrases.
: get someone to kill...
...end of my rope...
...want to destroy her like she destroyed me.
...smash her head in for the lies she...
I' kill her...
that's how she identifies potential clients.
and when she finds her mark, she plants a worm to compromise the computer and monitor all communications going in and out.
that way gains more intimate knowledge of the situation and times her approach based on what she's reading.
it's brilliant.
and it's...
it's evil, really evil.
but...
what are you thinking about?
fishing.
suspect X is still out there, and if her past is any indication, she's probably looking for business.
so you want to set a trap?
Adam, set up a half dozen untraceable e-mail accounts.
develop some believable conflict scenarios between people, and start sending threatening, inflammatory messages back and forth.
if she takes the bait, we may just catch ourselves a killer.
processed that, uh, metal based mystery liquid we found at the Kirkbaum crime scene.
XRF identified it as ferro liquid.
ferro liquid contains magnetic particles that react to sound.
what's a liquid used to treat iron deficiencies in humans doing in Suspect X's pocket?
maybe she added it to the mixture of the IV she was feeding Katie Mann.
impossible.
Sid did a blood workup.
Katie was suffering from a severe iron deficiency when she died.
there has to be another reason. Hmm.
speakers.
speakers?
ferro liquid is also used to cool voice coils in large commercial speakers.
technicians carry vials of it on their tool belt.
okay, I don't see the connection.
the woman Suspect X made to look like her.
Katie was an assistant to Jordan Gates, the mayor's criminal justice coordinator.
when we spoke with Jordan, she was at the Westside Pier prepping for a Green rally tonight.
they were setting up a large speaker system when we arrived.
Sheldon, this event has been on the books for months.
I'm thinking that, before Katie was killed,
suspect X got access to information that would have allowed her to get onto the grounds...
and wearing these coveralls, she posed as part of the sound crew in order to stake the place out.
you think she's planning on killing someone tonight?
the mayor is scheduled to make a big speech along with a lot of other politicians and dignitaries.
anyone on that stage could be a target.
Yeah, but security is going to be on lockdown.
she'd be crazy to try to walk up in there with a gun.
what if she didn't bring it in?
what if it were already there?
the mayor and everyone at this event is at great risk if we allow this rally to go on.
how credible is the threat?
very.
we have evidence we believe links our suspect to this location.
our intel indicates she's targeted this event for an assassination attempt.
gates: Detective Taylor believes the killer may have infiltrated the support staff tasked with setting up the event.
perhaps posing as a member of the sound crew.
we're looking into this matter as we speak.
we're concerned she may have smuggled a weapon onto the grounds and hidden it in advance of the rally.
the dog's hit on something, Flack.
anybody got a drill?
mac, we got it.
good work.
make sure we lock down the perimeter.
if she's here, we can't let her get away.
thank you.
MESSER: Mac, I don't know how we missed her.
we had every exit sealed off.
she left long before we shut the event down.
she's way too careful not to have been watching us.
tell Flack I want shadow details on the mayor and everyone else on that guest list.
as long as Suspect X is still out there, there's a chance she'll finish the job or go on to the next target.
and if she's watching our every move, that means she knows how close we got to her.
and with that kind of heat, you'd think she's lay low for a while, no?
this woman isn't capable of slowing down.
killing's the only thing she knows how to do, and her inability to stop is how we're going to catch her.
I'll get busy.
tell me you got something.
big time. I did what you said, and I opened up a bunch of untraceable e-mail accounts in various profiles.
one of them, I am this smoking hot 22-year-old girl who's having a little flingy-ding with this middle-aged married guy.
and, basically, I want the wife out...
Adam. Yeah.
Oh, right. Oh. Okay.
so I put a bunch of keywords and phrases that the recursive spider would log on to.
about a half hour ago, I got this message.
????????????
suspect X took the bait.
agents Beck and Halinan.
detective Angell.
network is secure.
thank you all for joining the TelePresence call.
you've all been briefed on our proposed tactical plan, so I'll jump right in here.
a meeting has been arranged between Suspect X and our undercover detective, Angell.
I just talked to Detective Flack.
he and his advance team are on site.
we're good to go.
good. The meet location is a bench on the north side of the plaza.
sergeant Williams, your tactical response team will stand by at 39th Street between Broadway and Seventh, waiting for my word to move in.
agents Beck and Halinan, your FBI surveillance team will have eyes on the outer perimeter. Let's hope one of your people spots her, and we can take her on the way in.
that would save us an awful lot of trouble.
detective Flack will be the ghost.
he'll be on set dressed as an employee from the Department of Parks.
I will be situated in a parking structure across the plaza.
every member of the team will have audio capability, but all communications will come through me.
no one moves without my order.
got movement coming in southeast.
FLACK: Just say the word.
nobody move.
it's too easy.
it's not her.
what's the note say?
don't move.
she sent somebody in first to make sure it wasn't a trap.
have somebody pick up the decoy and stand by.
I got a visual.
that's her.
Uni? Who the hell is that?
where did he come from?
he's not one of ours, Mac.
he's going to spook her.
move.
mac, I lost visual.
I got her, Flack.
headed due south towards Seventh Avenue.
man: Look out.
watch it!
she's changed her clothing.
lost the hat and scarf. The previous description of the suspect's no good.
I got her. Corner of 46th and Seventh.
new construction. I'm going in.
who are you?
anyone you want me to be...
...Detective.
lover.
friend.
fantasy.
nightmare.
take your pick.
based on the amount of blood leaving your body from that hole I put in your chest,
I'll go with dead.
that's not on the list.
this is all just a game, isn't it?
tell me.
what goes through your mind when you end a life?
besides playing God?
you don't have much time.
give me something.
a confession?
pulling the trigger is like...
...taking a deep breath of fresh air.
seeing that last...
...little speck of life in their eyes.
then when it fades...
I don't know.
I believe...
they're going to a better place.
mac, you okay?
I don't understand.
what does this have to do with me?
immediately following the pursuit, we were able to retrieve the suspect's client list from a PDA she had on her.
her last target wasn't the mayor or any of the other dignitaries at the events.
it was you.
me?
uh...
well, who-who hired her?
your ex-husband.
I'm sorry.
I don't have the heart to answer it and tell whoever it is the bad news that she's not going to make it.
there's several lacerations and pieces of glass in the palms of her hands.
she tried to get up.
means she was alive when the frame fell and busted her collarbone.
I imagine she tried to break the fall.
this sharp edge shattered the glass and she went right through the window.
I'm coming up short on any witnesses.
a couple people heard the crash, but nobody saw what happened.
you two finding anything that says this is murder?
no defensive wounds.
no evidence of a struggle.
no indication that she was pushed.
looks like Miranda Bauer simply stumbled out of her high-heeled shoes.
Stella, it's three nights in a row you've worked overtime.
you're running on fumes. Go home.
I'm fine, Mac.
clearly, this is an accident.
there's no need for both of us to be here.
which means I'm going to wind up doing all the work anyway.
20 minutes from now, he's going to be on the train home as well.
get out of here.
all right.
I don't want to go to bed!
I want to go home!
sweetie, Jason's got ice cream, okay?
Hey, Bonnie.
sounds like you have your hands full.
Oh, Stella. Sorry.
my niece.
I volunteered to help my sister out, and what we thought would be a fun little slumber party is basically a nightmare.
I apologize ahead of time if we keep you up.
good night.
good luck.
why don't you go play with your doll?
everybody out of the building!
it's a fire!
get out of the building!
come on, people! Get out of the building!
fire!
go, go, go! Get out!
go!
Hey, have you seen Bonnie? - No.
she lives over here, uh, blonde, she has a son that's 11.
everybody out of the building!
anybody in here?!
Jason, come here. Jason, come on.
Where's your mother and your cousin?
I don't know.
all right, just hold on and don't let go.
come on.
are you all right?
how could you just leave him up there, Bonnie?
I thought you were right behind me on the fire escape.
what happened?
I couldn't see you.
I'm so sorry, baby.
I didn't realize you weren't there until I got down here.
they wouldn't let me go back inside.
Where's your niece?
with the paramedics.
my sister's on her way.
are you okay?
are you sure you're okay? - Yeah...
are you sure?
come on.
Hey.
Hey.
the sprinkler systems didn't work.
here.
that's perfect.
so I got an extra room.
thank you, Mac.
I think I'm better off staying at a hotel.
I snore.
looks like it's arson.
fire investigators determined the point of origin is down the hall.
and we got a victim.
most significant burns are to the front of the body.
Stell, it'd be hard to tell who it is.
how many people lived in this apartment?
uh... just one, I think.
a sean...I-I don't know his last name.
I met him in the elevator, and then I think I saw him again twice after that.
according to the building's tenant manifest, his last name's Nolan.
lives alone; we're running the name with the DMV.
maybe he has a car.
we can see what's inside, complete his story.
nothing left in here gives us any help.
excuse me.
Yeah.
he was so close to the door.
I can't imagine why he couldn't get out.
Flack said the fire started in this apartment.
everything is pretty badly burned.
there's evidence of heavy and low burns.
a flashover.
most of the furniture looks like it was incinerated in seconds.
and buese thrns on the hardwood floor -
they look like accelerant pour patterns.
you're thinking Sean started the fire?
but if he did, it doesn't add up;
he had plenty of time to make it out of the building.
which is why I'm thinking someone else was here.
maybe they had an argument, it got physical.
Sean Nolan goes down, the attacker starts the fire and escapes.
okay, but the fire investigator said the door was bolted.
we found the vic's keys on the table.
can't bolt the door from the outside without the keys.
so maybe our "somebody else" didn't use the door.
the investigator said that this window was open.
that's a long jump.
not impossible to survive, but somebody's walking around with a broken tibia.
our vic may be the fire starter.
Sean Nolan was convicted and served time five years ago for arson.
well, that might explain our malfunctioning sprinkler system.
maybe he tampered with it.
I see doubt.
doesn't fit the profile, Flack.
a guy starts a fire and then sticks around?
most arsonists like to watch their work from across the street, down the block, on the news.
maybe this was sean's idea of the perfect suicide.
Hey, it's me.
Hey.
how's Stella doing? Is she okay?
Yeah, she's gonna be all right.
well, you tell her if she needs anything-- all right?
I mean anything-- I'm there.
I'll tell her.
so, listen, I was thinking before your shift maybe we could have lunch?
my turn to buy.
actually, I got to run to the bank, I got to run to the dry cleaners,
I got to... bring my bike to the shop.
I've been meaning to get it fixed.
is everything okay?
what's wrong?
what are you talking about,"what's wrong?
nothing's wrong.
I just, I just got some stuff to do, and, uh, I'll see you at work. All right?
Bye.
maybe I should take a rain check on Messer's famous omelet.
it sounds like you have a busy day.
no, no, no, this is something you don't want to pass up.
this omelet is a masterpiece.
I'm making one for myself; making two is like nothing.
it's just a breakfast. Just breakfast, Rikki.
and last night was just sex.
before my son died, you were just a guy that I smiled at in the hallway and joked with at the mailboxes.
what are we doing?
we're making each other feel better, all right?
because Ruben's gone. There's nothing wrong with that.
one day, you're gonna wake up and realize that Ruben's death wasn't your fault.
Yes, he was with you when he was shot, but it was an accident.
and me...
can't you see that I'm just taking advantage of the guilt you feel, so that I don't have to be alone?
I don't care.
I don't care 'cause I just want this hurt to go away.
don't you?
I really should go.
okay, okay.
but this is my shirt, all right?
I'm gonna need my shirt back, okay?
before you go...
I must tell you, I don't, at this moment, have a C. O.D.
he didn't die of smoke inhalation?
no, because your victim didn't die in the fire.
the trachea was free of any soot deposits.
that means he wasn't breathing, which means he definitely died before the fire.
and I ran DNA to confirm that this was our arsonist-- no match in our database.
well, he'd have to be in there-- he's a convicted felon.
Yes, but there's a very good explanation.
take a look at the fastscan.
brow ridge and sinus cavity are small.
your he is a she.
so this isn't the body of Sean Nolan.
exactly.
then who is she, and more importantly, where is he?
the body we found in the apartment is a woman.
the fire compromised all physiological indicators establishing T. O.D.
Flack is checking missing persons for a lead on the victim's identity.
he's also got an alarm out on NYspin and a wanted card out on Sean Nolan.
okay, so we're back to the evidence we collected from the scene.
Sid's preliminary autopsy report suggests our victim's age is somewhere between 30 and 40.
I wouldn't guess she died of natural causes, so our focus shifts to foul play.
how you doing? What'd I miss?
perfect timing.
there's a lot of work to do.
Lindsay, catch Danny up.
priority is the identity of our female victim.
I want to know who she is and what's her connection to our arsonist Sean Nolan.
it may help us find him.
that fire may have been a cover-up for murder.
why don't you catch up by reading this.
is this real?
you think's someone's in trouble?
I don't know, Adam.
you know, I found these in my apartment after the fire.
the edges are singed and the paper is burned, so, clearly, they were were in the apartment before the fire started.
and you don't recognize the writing?
no.
maybe it's from a friend?
Oh, and this "friend" wrote me a note that said "help me"?
maybe you're a bad cook.
I'm-I'm just saying...
uh, actually, Adam, since I shot my boyfriend two years ago,
I don't exactly have people over.
um... well, maybe it's from like, uh...
a maid, building maintenance, gas company, doorman.
Nah, it doesn't make any sense.
I mean, I-I found these on the floor, behind a piece of furniture.
if it hadn't fallen apart when I moved it, I would've never have seen them.
if these notes were intended for me, then why were they hidden?
please help me. Help my na...
my name, maybe?
why don't you get a chemical fingerprint of the ink, see if you can find a pen manufacturer.
Oh, and age the ink solvent.
maybe that will tell me how long ago these were written.
I'll let you know what I find.
Oh, and, Stella?
um... I'm, uh...
I'm-I'm glad you're okay.
Thanks, Adam.
what do you see?
goldfish?
they were in Sean Nolan's apartment, and these two little guys are going to help us establish our vic's time of death.
if goldfish are left in the dark for an extended period of time, their color starts to fade.
they're made up of cells called chromatophores that produce pigments which reflect light and give coloration.
these pigments are stimulated by sunlight, much the way a humans tan in the sun.
pale pink is the result of roughly three to five days of darkness -
possibly our vic's time of death.
so you're saying our vic was dead in that apartment at least two days prior to the fire?
and Sean Nolan wasn't there either?
the fish are faded.
means no lights were turned on, the blinds were closed.
basically no signs of life.
we normally determine time of death based on lividity, but the fire compromised the body.
so what are we thinking here?
our arsonist killed our vic, panics takes off for a few days, but knowing he has a dead body in his apartment, he comes back and sets a fire?
it's murder-- it doesn't have to make sense.
okay, okay. Let us know.
that's Flack.
he's got our arsonist, Sean Nolan, in custody.
boom!
a woman burned to death, Sean.
her name is Marla Bronson.
she was taking care of my fish.
and killing her is your way of saying thanks?
I'll say it again:
I have been in boston for the past week attending an insurance convention.
it takes a second to strike a match, and less than an hour to get back to boston by plane.
is that the story? Did I figure it out?
you look a little nervous.
you just told me that someone I cared about is dead.
and you're accusing me of taking her life, which I did not do!
and I did not burn down my own home!
this wasn't an amateur job, Sean.
somebody definitely knew what he was doing.
what kind of accelerant did you use?
same as the last fire?
lighter fluid?
your neighbors don't have anywhere to live, Sean.
some of them lost everything they owned.
did you watch from across the street?
did the fire excite you?
maybe you were down the block, in the high-rise, watching the plumes of black smoke.
I made a mistake in my past...
and I served my time!
I did not kill Marla, and I did not start th fatire, and I am done talking to you.
one of your neighbors is someone I care a lot about.
she no longer has a place to live, and she risked her life pulling a boy out of that building and when I prove you did this, you will answer to me.
Marla Bronson's death is the result of a car accident.
I noticed small hairline fractures on both her right and left thumbs, roughly in the same place.
fractures commonly caused by the release of an airbag.
right.
the driver holds onto the steering wheel, airbag releases, and the impact fractures the proximal phalanx of both hands.
but, Sid, nobody dies from broken thumbs.
official C. O.D. Is massive internal hemorrhaging.
this is Marla's ruptured spleen.
the damage to her body by the fire delayed my discovery.
now, this, uh, tear in the tissue suggests that the impact was pretty significant.
despite that, her death wasn't immediate.
because someone can suffer a ruptured spleen and walk around for a couple days and not even know it.
which would explain why she wasn't in a hospital.
so Marla had a car accident.
days later, she collapsed because she was hemorrhaging.
she was dead on the ground in Nolan's apartment when the fire started.
and if we go with my goldfish theory, time of death was roughly three days ago.
with that said, we can confidently draw the conclusion that not only didn't she die in the fire, but this is not a homicide.
but, Sid, if Sean Nolan didn't start the fire to cover up her murder, what are we looking at here?
the fire didn't start in Sean Nolan's apartment.
but there were accelerant pour patterns, a flashover.
he's a suspect who's been convicted of arson.
you're gonna have to have a pretty good defense to counter that.
exhibit A.
I took a sample of the floor to determine the exact type of accelerant used.
I found traces of gasoline.
now, I know there's no better fuel to start a fire, right?
I also found varnish on the wood, so I took a surface sample-- no gasoline.
so the accelerant was beneath the varnish?
or... mixed in.
sometimes gas is used as a thinner for paints and varnishes, and if burned, can be mistaken for pour patterns.
and suddenly, we have no evidence of accelerant.
what about the flashover and the evidence of heavy and low burns?
exhibit B.
most of the furniture in Sean Nolan's apartment was comprised of polyurethane foam.
which is highly flammable; goes up in seconds.
it turned the apartment into an incinerator.
and explains the flashover.
so if the fire didn't start in Sean Nolan's apartment, where'd it start?
I don't know.
well, let's find out.
Nolan's apartment sustained the most damage, as well as the apartment on the upper floor.
the adjacent apartment, here, is vacant.
that's Bonnie Dillard's apartment and mine.
and they both sustained significant damage.
doesn't give us a lot to work with and we still don't have a motive.
so, what if a fire started in the vacant apartment?
okay, let's try to prove that.
the exterior wall is brick.
it slows the fire.
and there's no furniture or flammables in this room to fuel the blaze.
right, but wouldn't that explain why the fire traveled left and right?
something's got to pull it in some direction, lindsay.
the vacant apartment was the least damaged.
it's as if the flames just skipped right over it.
you eliminated Sean Nolan's apartment, Stella didn't start the blaze.
that leaves one option.
Bonnie Dillard's apartment.
found this cigarette lighter under the bed.
I've got partial prints.
Bonnie's a smoker.
I can't believe she'd do something like this.
isn't this her son's room?
if the fire started in here, why did it do the most damage to Nolan's apartment, which is further away?
a fire feeds on oxygen.
it searches for it.
the window in Nolan's apartment must've been open.
the flames traveled through this air duct.
Lindsay, collect anything we can lift prints from and get it back to the lab.
we should be able to generate our own secondary reference sample from items belonging to Bonnie or Jason.
we'll compare them to the partials on the lighter.
Flack just called.
Bonnie Dillard didn't leave a forwarding address with your super, so he's going to check all hotels, bus and train stations.
linds, are you two seeing this?
you happen to have a picture of Jason or Bonnie?
I didn't know them that well.
you know, maybe I could give a description to a sketch artist.
are you sure this is right?
I ran it twice, got the same result.
doesn't make sense that this print would match the partial we found on the lighter.
it's completely unrelated.
you guys want to let us in on this?
so far, none of the prints we've lifted off the Dillards' personal items have been a match to those we found on the lighter.
so it wasn't Bonnie Dillard or her son that started the fire.
so, we're back to our arsonist Sean Nolan?
no.
partials on the lighter are small.
they belong to a child.
to Bailey O'dell.
the little girl who's been missing?
how's that possible?
her parents registered her thumbprint on our safe child database.
it's a match.
it was her.
Bonnie Dillard has her.
she said it was her niece.
you saw Bailey O'dell?
no. I heard her.
she was in Bonnie's apartment.
she was right next door.
I didn't see her. I heard her.
she was saying she wanted to go home.
how can we be sure that that was Bailey O'dell?
because that's the only explanation of how that little girl's prints were on the lighter.
she was within my reach, Mac.
right there.
I'll track down the other tenants .
I want a subpoena on Bonnie Dillard's entire life; check with DMV on a vehicle.
I know she had a van-- silver.
where does Bonnie work?
she's a... a florist.
specialty place.
does arrangements for hotels and high-end parties.
what about Jason's school?
any clubs, after-school activities?
I moved in two years ago.
I didn't make an effort to get to know anyone.
hallway relationships.
Bonnie ever talk about her family?
she never mentioned a sister until last night, and clearly that was a lie.
to tell you the truth, I don't even know if Bonnie Dillard's her real name.
right here.
there we go.
let's try this.
blonde woman, uh, five-eight.
she has a son.
he's 11 years old.
his name is Jason.
well, let me make it simpler:
is there any male child, 11 years old, who's absent from school today?
we have a sketch that we can fax over.
no, I get it. Thank you.
there, that's her van coming out of the building's garage.
that's definitely Bonnie.
let's see if we can get the plate.
we got it; we'll set up an amber alert.
Thanks, Hawkes.
thank you.
I'm going to get some coffee. You want some coffee?
no. Thanks.
how long are you going to stay mad at me, Linds?
Oh, is that what this is?
me mad at you?
is this still about missing your birthday?
look, I didn't want to go to lunch yesterday.
why do you got to make such a big deal out of it?
do me a favor, Danny.
don't reduce me to some shallow, clingy girlfriend that's starting to suffocate you, okay?
that's not what this is about.
ever since Ruben Sandoval died...
I feel like I've lost my best friend.
and don't mistake this for jealousy, okay?
I know what it's like to lose someone you care about.
to see them one day and then not see them the next, and to know you're never going to see them again.
I would never expect you not to grieve.
but clearly, you know, you've just decided to do it all on your own.
okay. I get it.
my mistake for thinking that you might need somebody to lean on.
and you know, fothr e record, I'm not mad at you.
I'm mad at myself.
because I've fallen in love with you and I have to figure out how to let that go.
we found Bonnie's van.
it appears to be abandoned.
now, Flack posted unis at the scene, just in case she comes back.
I sent a crew to process it.
hopefully, they'll find something that'll lead us back to Bailey O'dell.
what about Jason Dillard? Where is he?
there was a tenant in the building who actually knew what school he went to.
he hasn't been there in over a week.
even before the fire.
I think Bonnie has him with her.
but he's already a troubled kid.
I can't imagine what he's thinking now.
he's troubled in what way?
when I first moved into my apartment, he made a hole in the grout of an adjacent brick wall.
what the...?
where is it, jason?
I don't know.
boy stuff, right?
he could see right through to my bedroom.
he's just 11 years old.
so much of this case doesn't make any sense.
how does the fire play into all of this?
and why does a six year-old little girl even know how to use a lighter?
what?
for the last two days, I've been trying to figure out how to gingey rltell you to sit this one out -
go deal with the loss of your home, take care of yourself -
but I realize now what a total waste of my breath that would have been.
Hey, guys.
Bonnie Dillard called her insurance company about issuing a check for the damage to her apartment.
she give an address?
she requested they call her when the check was ready and she'd pick it up.
it's an ongoing arson investigation;
they won't process claims for at least another two weeks.
or maybe with a little encouragement from us, they can do it sooner.
my man's getting sneaky.
have the insurance company call Bonnie Dillard, tell her to pick her check up in an hour.
it's always the greed that gets them.
Danny, there she is.
print green shirt, brown pants, sunglasses, heading towards the insurance building.
you approach her. I'll cut her off.
Bonnie? Hey, how you doing?
do I know you?
uh, no. Not yet.
don't move!
where is she, Bonnie?
Where's Bailey O'dell?
come on, Bonnie-- you abandoned your own son in that fire because you knew you had to hide that little girl before the police arrived.
her face was all over the news.
you knew we'd know who she was.
where is she?
I believe I have the right to remain silent.
come on.
where are you keeping Bailey O'dell?
you know, I don't understand this.
my home just burned down, my son was almost killed in the fire, my niece is sick from the smoke.
she's not your niece, Bonnie.
you took this little girl from her family and they want her back!
well, they can't have her back.
why not?
because she's much happier where she is now.
and where is that, Bonnie?
someplace beautiful and peaceful.
better than with them.
they're divorced, you know.
her mother's a single parent.
she works part-time at my floral shop.
brings the kid in when she can't get a babysitter.
it was so easy to take her 'cause she knew me already.
when I was pregnant, they told me I shouldn't be a single mother.
they said a child should have two parents.
when you were pregnant with Jason?
no. This was before Jason.
and you gave the baby up for adoption?
they took her from me.
Bonnie, don't take this little girl from her family.
it's done!
they're not getting her back.
just tell me where she is.
is Jason with her?
shouldn't I have a lawyer?
I mean, I'm not sure I should say anything more.
is Bonnie Dillard capable of murder?
if you'd asked me a week ago, if I thought she could abduct a child I'd have said no.
and now?
I think she's capable of anything.
I think I might have a possible lead on where Bonnie Dillard is holding Bailey O'dell;
we'll take whatever we can get.
Sandplain gerardia.
it's a pollen grain that fell off Bonnie's clothing.
she's a florist. It makes sense to find that kind of trace.
right, but this particular pollen comes from the only federally protected endangered plant species in all of new york state.
in fact, six of the 12 natural populations in the world are in long island.
so we go to long island.
no, because I don't think that's where this pollen originated.
I found traces of a chemical toxin.
now, the plants in long island, they're not only endangered, they're federally protected.
there's no way they would let a toxin interfere with the growth of the plant.
so it means this plant is growing somewhere else in new york.
illegally.
so it's illegal to grow this plant?
well, somebody had to steal a protected plant to grow it outside of long isla nd.
they could be federally prosecuted, which is why I'm having trouble locating it.
anybody who would know anything isn't talking.
so I made a few scientific, educated assumptions.
now, wherever these plants are, they're near a factory.
that makes sense-- the toxins are carried by the wind, deposited over the plants.
I've cross-referenced all the factories emitting that same toxin with any vacant lots, empty buildings, greenhouses in the city.
I can't promise anything, but I'm keeping my fingers crossed.
what do you want to do?
well, let's hope Lindsay gets us something.
in the meantime, we go with the only thing we've got: Bonnie Dillard in custody.
we got to get her to tell us where she's holding that little girl.
I'm sorry.
we should-- we should talk.
we have a rooftop address.
get Stella.
we've got a lead on the little girl that was missing.
Adam, can I catch up with you later?
no. No, look, okay.
you need to know this. I'm not playing around.
all right, you got 15 seconds.
the notes you gave me were written approximately two years ago by an ordinary, everyday ink pen.
Oh, there better be more.
I decided to look a little closer and I found traces of quartz, clay, limestone and gypsum.
Icbrk mortar.
the mortar acted as a developer of several latent prints that otherwise would have evaporated.
okay, so now I got a bunch of prints, and what am I supposed to do but run them through the database.
got no hits on any criminal activity, but they were a match to the prints that Lindsay and Hawkes lifted from the items in Bonnie Dillard's apartment.
which items?
football, basketball, ipod.
these prints belong to Jason Dillard.
he wrote those notes, Stella. He wrote "help me."
she took him, too.
Hey, Mac.
hold your fire!
did you write these?
I am so sorry, Jason.
I just found them yesterday.
and now I realize what a terrible, terrible mistake I made.
I accused you of something that wasn't true, and...
you were just pushing these notes through the wall because you needed my help.
Oh, I'm so sorry I never got them.
I really am.
that's okay.
I found out my first mom didn't want me anyway.
who told you that? Bonnie?
am I going to jail?
for what?
that dead body.
you and Bailey started the fire.
she was scared and wanted to go home.
I thought the fire would be a good idea because the police would come.
I didn't want to burn anybody.
of course you didn't.
no, Jason, you're not going to jail, okay?
is Jason your real name?
no, just pretend.
What'd your first mom call you?
I like that name.
me, too.
you're going to be okay, Austin.
Austin will be a bit confused.
he's been told that you don't want him.
and he believes that woman who took him rescued him.
she used words to gain his trust and love.
he never ran away because she convinced him there was no place to run to.
it'll probably take awhile for him to show affection and he'll want to know why you never came to get him.
children believe their parents can do anything.
so, saying you couldn't find him or you tried everything, just may not be enough.
just be patient, Ms. Tanner.
I will.
he's coming home.
Austin Tanner was reunited with his family today, after four years as a kidnap victim.
Oh, my god!
Jesse! Hey!
car keys, people!
you're not out of here yet, unfortunately.
you're still our responsibility.
very funny, Mr. Carver.
don't give me a reason to withdraw my recommendation to Yale.
save me a dance?
have fun, Lacey.
car keys.
thank you.
give it up for our king and queen:
Jason Francis and Laura Davis!
only two more months, people!
as your class president,
I feel it is my responsibility to ensure that each and every one of you doesn't slack off.
however, to avoid being impeached...
my advice is to skip more classes!
blow off a calculus final!
let's make these last few weeks count!
on behalf of all of you when I say that I...
genuinely love this place.
I want to thank the faculty...
integrity and morals that will guide us into a future rife with promise.
our vic is Robert Greggs.
he was a guidance counselor.
divorced, no kids.
he also chaperoned the dance and played key master.
who discovered the body?
you two have been working together way too long.
a student came in looking for her keys and...boom.
boom?
you and Danny have been working together way too long.
this guy took a hell of a beating.
witnesses?
no one's come forward yet.
but we got a gym full of potential suspects right next door.
say cheese!
Behold...the future.
Yeah, future suspects, Mac.
sulfuric acid...
hydrochloric acid.
he couldn't have kept the keys in the English room?
which one of those you think melted this guy's face off?
hydrofluoric acid, highly lethal.
trace amounts of this on the skin can dissolve and eat it away without you even knowing it.
half a bottle of this spills on your face?
why would you keep something that dangerous in a high school lab?
probably to demonstrate its ability to dissolve glass.
it's commonly used in glass etching.
silicon dioxide...
plus four molecules of hydrofluoric acid...
Produces?
Oh, me, me, me, pick me!
that's cold, man.
one minute Mr. Gregg was there and the next, he was gone.
do you remember the last time you saw him?
he introduced me before my speech, but I don't know where he went after that.
do you know of any students who might have had something against him?
no. Everyone loved Mr. Greggs.
the guy was useless.
any one of those guys fits the profile.
did you see where Mr. Greggs went after he introduced the president of your class?
no, uh-uh.
but I took a picture on my phone when he was up there.
will this help?
mind if I borrow that for a while?
sure. I have another one at home.
of course you do.
Mr. Greggs was an inspiring mentor, the kind of man I'd like to be in 20 years -
only making 50 times more money.
it's sad when such a young life is taken from us before... - stop.
Just...Stop.
what do you know?
well, I think we're looking at a fairly short window of opportunity.
most of the kids remember the vic introducing the class president.
and at one point during her speech, she referenced Mr. Greggs, but he wasn't in the gym.
one student snapped this photo at exactly 10: 18.
so he was alive at 10: 18...
what time was the body found?
approximately 10: 30.
a 12-minute window.
it's possible he left the gym with someone during that period.
I'm gonna collect as many of these as I can, get them back to Adam.
if the students didn't see anything, maybe their cell phones did.
no, everyone else's priorities need to be checked, not mine.
Yeah, yeah, all right, I get it.
every five minutes, it's someone else.
half the brass wants me working the cab driver serial.
but you caught a murder at an elite prep school whose alumni contributes half the mayor's campaign funds.
not to mention deputy inspector Gerrard's daughter is a student here.
but until we catch this cab driver, my phone's not going to stop ringing.
matter of time.
I got uniforms conducting taxi checkpoints throughout the five boroughs, flyers distributed to dispatchers, and foot posts on bridges and overpasses in case he decides to dump another victim.
maybe we need to use the media.
they already know we're looking for a yellow cab, rigged to allow carbon monoxide to flow into the passenger compartment.
tell 'em about the disabled rear door locks and the torn passenger bill of rights sticker.
but don't mention the marks he leaves on the back of the victims' necks.
you got it.
Hey, uh, what about the tarps he wraps the vics in?
any leads on that yet?
you're gonna start riding my ass now, too?
Yeah, he's claimed at least three victims that we know of.
all died of carbon monoxide poisoning after getting in his cab.
let's hope we don't have to wait for another body to surface.
do you have any idea how often I've wondered what would happen if you swallowed this stuff?
and there it is, sitting on the shelf, perhaps the most corrosive acid known to man, and you just get that urge to take a swig.
you know what I'm talking about?
Absolutely.
it's like whenever I pick up a scalpel,
I wonder if I could perform a live autopsy on myself.
you do that, too? Cause I thought I was...
don't play with me lik. Thate the cod is pulmonary edema.
as you can see, your victim ingested more than the recommended dose of zero cc's of hydrofluoric acid, 'causing the walls of the trachea to inflame, the lungs to fill with fluid, and, ultimately, respiratory failure.
nothing to suggest the acid was forced down his throat.
bloodshot eye, no petechial hemorrhaging.
fumes from the acid?
most likely, the capillaries were also dilated.
I took a swab of the cornea and sent it to trace to confirm.
now, the periodic table got the best of him, but, uh, your vic also took a pretty severe beating.
a fractured jaw.
is part of his cheekbone missing there?
more of the marvels of hydrofluoric acid.
as it dissolves into the skin, the Fluoride anion combines with the Calcium in the bones to dissociate the Calcium...
causing the bones to liquefy.
the beating suggests this was personal. No?
possibly.
Ooh, I love me some ho hos.
and I want all your money...
Oh, yes, hi. Stella.
uh... yeah.
you familiar with photosynth?
photosynth?
Yes. Taking a large collection of photos, analyzing the similarities and displaying them in a reconstructed three-dimensional space.
exactly.
build me a high school gym.
okay.
what up?
are you serious?
this is peyote.
marijuana seeds,'shrooms.
looks like someone was growing their own magic garden.
right under the faculty's nose, man.
sometimes too much education can be a dangerous thing.
Lindsay found a flask in the vic's pocket, so we got drugs, alcohol...
Yeah, and also one other little gem.
places our royal couple at the crime scene.
looks like we got our kingpin.
but it wasn't me.
you got the wrong guy, man, I'm telling you.
it was Jason's idea.
I don't even know what peyote is.
he said peyote was used by native Americans to pray and induces a dreamlike, drifting sensation.
you think I'd be that stupid to do that in one of the classrooms?
come on, they'll never know. It'll be hysterical.
Laura's way too sweet to get caught up in something like that.
what a jackass.
so what happened? You two go into the lab, check on your little experiment,
Mr. Greggs catches you, notices the drugs.
Mr. Greggs never came in, not while we were in there.
we also found a flask that was confiscated by Mr. Greggs.
sounds like you two were looking to do some partying, huh?
I don't know anything about a flask.
we didn't drink anything last night.
we'll let your DNA tell us that.
I swear, Jason just wanted to see if the marijuana seeds were starting to grow.
then we left.
it was just a goof.
we weren't going to use the drugs.
honest.
everything okay?
same old same old with the bosses.
why haven't I dragged someone in on the taxicab serial?
meanwhile, the mayor wants you focused on the prep school homicide.
the faster we can solve it, the faster I can put more resources into the cab killer.
anyway, where are we on the prep school homicide?
pulled DNA off the flask we found in Robert Greggs' jacket.
turns out it was his.
no other prints or profiles?
Nope.
he was knocking a few back at the dance.
it seems like our guidance counselor was a bit misguided.
nice office for a guidance counselor.
what exactly are we looking for?
a reason for Mr. Greggs to start drinking.
harvard, Princeton, Yale, Dartmouth.
this place is a machine for churning out Ivy League students.
Lindsay, you have the crime scene photos?
Yeah.
he's missing his watch.
we recovered his wallet.
didn't read like a robbery.
maybe he just forgot to wear it.
maybe.
definitely escaping from something.
well, he wasn't much for dressing the part.
probably couldn't afford it, making only a tad more than their tuition.
supplemental income?
but what's with these tokens?
you see something?
no. Let's go.
what the hell are we doing here?
the vic made extra cash fluffing and folding?
tokens don't work.
they only take quarters.
went a little overboard on the "out of order" sign.
we're going to need some backup.
Hey, you, get off the phone.
now, what...
it's like I told you.
all right, you want to help me out here, turn around...
watch the shoes!
I think we got our guy.
hundred bucks says you're the good cop, he's the bad cop.
Where'd you get the watch?
it was a gift. What do you care?
it belongs to a dead man.
you got that right.
some DA's might consider that a confession.
how much he owe you? - Who?
robert Greggs, the owner of the watch.
18 grand.
so, 18 in the hole gets you a face full of acid, huh? - What?
tell you what, I'll give you the benefit of the doubt.
the acid was an accident, still, the beatdown gets you manslaughter.
you want to tell me what he's talking about?
I think you know.
he's not dead, is he?
tell me he's not dead.
15 grand down the drain.
where were you last night?
right here.
waiting for that degenerate to give me at least a piece of what he owed.
the watch knocked off three, and he said he could scrape up another five.
but he never showed.
Greggs had till the end of the week to make good.
otherwise?
otherwise...
I'd get some use out of that new shovel I bought.
now I'm gonna talk to all these people over here.
if they don't confirm that you were here last night, all night, the only dice you're gonna roll is with a jury, you hear me?
Hey, Mac?
your gambler's alibi checked out, didn't it?
someone beat him to the punch.
how'd you know?
because I think we might be looking for a girl.
tan trace we found on the vic's shirt cuff.
makeup?
some sort of concealer.
nothing unique about it, so we couldn't track down a specific manufacturer.
victim was tossed around pretty good.
maybe we're dealing with more than one killer.
it's hard to believe a high school girl could have beat him up like that.
unless she incapacitated him in some way.
the swab Sid collected from around the vic's eyes came back as pepper spray.
victim's capillaries were dilated.
we thought it was the fumes from the acid, but the pepper spray must have blinded him.
anyone could have had their way with him after that.
these were among the keys lying next to the vic.
positive for pepper spray.
who do they belong to?
you're not gonna like the answer to that.
what do you mean, don't get worked up?
my daughter's in the box.
you're telling me you have evidence that might link her to a murder.
I think I got a right to be worked up.
there's nothing's conclusive right now, inspector.
we just need to ask her some questions, and then we know where we stand.
I want to be in there.
I don't think that's a good idea.
I don't give a damn what you think.
listen to me. Calm down for a second.
I'm telling you straight, Stan, I don't make her for Robert Greggs' murder, but maybe she can tell us something that'll put us onto the right person.
she's scared, Stan.
you being in there isn't going to help.
we have a better chance of learning what happened that night if detective Monroe and I go in there alone.
if you don't like the path we're going down, you just knock on the window, and it's over.
you have my word.
all right.
do you know why you're here, Natalie?
look, I'm sure you've heard enough stories from your father to know how this usually goes.
I have a great deal of respect for your father, so, no tricks, no hidden agenda.
I'm just trying to get a better understanding of what happened at the dance.
I don't know what happened.
I wish I could believe that was true.
well, it is.
what was your relationship with Mr. Greggs like?
what do you mean?
over the last three months, you and he have had a lot of meetings. - So?
why did you withdraw your acceptance to Northwestern?
everybody in your class is going to college, Natalie.
everybody except you.
why did you change your mind?
college isn't for everyone.
in the last three months, you went from being an a student to A C student.
you became withdrawn from your classmates.
and then the disecion not to go to college.
what happened?
nothing happened.
I just don't want to go, okay?
had a lot of meetings with Mr. Greggs because he was interested in my future.
or maybe he was interested in you.
is there any chance that Mr. Greggs misinterpreted the time that you were spending together?
maybe make a pass at you?
Mr. Greggs would never do that.
but you told him you didn't think of him like that.
we know he'd been drinking.
did he ask you to meet him in the science lab the night of the dance?
he came onto you, so you used your pepper spray on him.
he took a hell of a beating.
you must have brought someone with you.
you have no idea what you're talking about.
who are you trying to protect, Natalie?
okay. We're going to need to take a sample of your makeup.
detective Monroe...
don't say another word, Natalie.
this interview is over.
pretty cool, huh?
the clarity is unbelievable.
and in 3-D.
well done.
so, we know that Robert Greggs introduced the president at 10: 18.
the question is, where did he go after that, and with whom?
can you zoom in to the crowd on the other side of the platform?
Yup.
here you go. Over there.
rotate it 90 degrees.
hold on. Hold on. Go to the left.
no. A little more. A little more.
go wide.
little bit more.
go in.
there.
right there.
zoom in on that door.
a little bit more.
that's our vic heading out the side door.
zoom in a little closer.
there someone in front of him.
wait a minute.
I know him. I mean...I mean, I-I don't know his name, but...
hold on one second.
skull and crossbones.
Yeah, I knew I'd seen that before.
that's our guy.
I asked him for my girlfriend's keys.
and your girlfriend is?
she drove that night, so I went next door to the science lab with Mr. G to get her keys for her.
it was at 10: 15. The dance wasn't over till midnight.
she wasn't feeling well.
am I a suspect?
she couldn't wait till after the speech?
I'm not sure I like where this is going.
Mr. Greggs was killed between 10: 18 and 10: 30.
it's a short window.
and here you are heading into the science lab with him at 10: 20.
how do you know that's me?
it's microsoft's world, kid.
I'm just living in it.
I told you, we just went to get Lacey's keys.
he gave them to me, and we left.
I didn't hear about Mr. G being killed until the next morning.
and Lacey Pearlman can confirm that?
Absolutely.
Flack, we need you outside.
Where's my son! I want to see my son!
where the hell is he? - Sir, calm down.
no, I will not calm down.
I want to talk to my son.
it's okay, Jimmy.
can I help you, sir?
I'm Jesse's father. Is he in there?
what are you doing to him?
we're not doing anything to him, Mr...
I want all questions to stop right now.
I've called a lawyer, and he's on his way.
Mr. Carver, your son is not a suspect.
we're just asking him some questions.
Yeah, I'm sure it's been very cordial.
is he under arrest?
I just told you... - Then I'm taking my son home.
I just got off the phone with Flack.
Jesse Carver's girlfriend confirmed his story.
she said she was feeling a little nauseous and asked Carver to get her keys, and they met out front.
uh, that's not much of an alibi, and he was still alone with the victim during a 12-minute window.
Yeah, that's what I said, but this Lacey Pearlman claims that there was nothing strange about Carver's behavior when they met outside.
in fact, they sat down for a few minutes so she could get some air.
you still think Gerrard's daughter had something to do with this?
well, she's involved somehow.
just not sure what she knows.
talk to some of the students, see what you can find out about her.
okay.
I will get you.
Oh, yes, you will be mine.
Adam, come here.
pull up the photosynth picture of the high school gym.
perfect.
time of the class president's speech.
rotate to the right.
Yeah, that's Mr. Greggs.
okay, keep going.
rotate 180 degrees.
what are you looking for?
not what, who.
okay. Who are we looking for?
someone who might not be there.
this some sort of Abbott and Costello Routine?
cause if it is, I got dibs on Costello.
stop.
there.
zoom in on the girl in the pink dress.
inspector Gerrard's daughter.
at the time of the speech.
she was leaving.
you saw Mr. Greggs go into the science lab with Jesse Carver.
where were you going, Natalie?
home.
I was tired.
without your keys?
we talked to some of your friends at school.
they said that you and Jesse dated for a little while about three months ago.
why didn't you ever mention him?
you went out three or four times.
that's when your grades started to slip, and you became withdrawn.
what happened, Natalie?
why are you protecting him?
sweetheart, please.
if you know something that can help them, anything...
now's the time.
I'm not going to let anything happen to you.
I promise, Natalie, I would never let anyone hurt you.
I didn't want him to do it to her, too.
what-what do you mean, Natalie?
Mr. Greggs?
what did he do to you, baby?
can I talk to her?
alone?
Yes, of course you can.
why don't you and i just go outside for a bit?
do you need a few minutes?
I'm okay.
listen, Natalie, this kind of thing, it happens more than you would think.
if Mr. Greggs came on to you or touched you in any way...
not him.
Mr. Greggs was always nice to me.
Jesse?
what did he do to you?
he was so charming and funny.
he really knew how to make me feel good.
so I went out with him a few times.
and this one time we went to a party, and Jesse kept bringing me drinks.
and I remember telling myself to slow down...
but I liked him.
I wanted him to see that I could keep up.
that I could be the life of the party, too.
afterwards, we went back to his house.
my head was spinning.
I could barely make it up the steps.
it's okay.
what happened upstairs?
I don't know.
I remember Jesse on top of me.
and...and there was someone else.
I felt someone else touching me.
did you tell anybody?
I was too embarrassed.
I should know better than to put myself in that situation.
you can't blame yourself, Natalie.
this is not your fault.
Yeah, my father's deputy inspector.
try telling him that.
what did you mean when you said you didn't want him to do it to her, too?
Lacey.
I saw Jesse pour alcohol into a glass.
I knew what he was doing.
I couldn't let him get away with it again.
so you told Mr. Greggs what Jesse had done to you.
when I saw Mr. Greggs pull Jesse aside, I grabbed my coat and left.
I didn't care about my keys, I just wanted to get out of there.
I should've never said anything.
Yes, Natalie, you should have.
you saw that he was going to do it to somebody else.
you had to say something.
now, I'm sorry to have to ask you this, but...
is there somebody I can talk to?
or is there something that can corroborate what happened with Jesse?
I still have the dress I wore...
the night he raped me.
I'm sorry, Daddy.
Taxi!
I think I'm going to be sick.
is that Natalie's dress?
Yep.
she kept it in a plastic bag in the back of her closet.
we collected semen samples.
there were two donors, just like she said.
call the DA. Get a warrant for Jesse Carver's DNA.
we don't need to.
he's already in the system.
one of the donors is a guy named Frank Moore, aka Wallace Carver.
he's not Jesse's father.
he's a convicted sex offender.
he was released four years ago, never registered.
he fell off the map.
and the other donor is Jesse Carver.
except... he's not Jesse Carver.
1999 sexual assault, 2001 sexual assault...
check out the date of birth.
march 18, 1976.
he's 32 years old, Mac.
he was posing as a 17-year-old student to prey on high school girls.
clear!
put your hands behind your back.
now!
Freeze!
don't move.
there's a special place in hell for guys like you, Frank.
I've always wanted to travel someplace warm.
you and Hank met while doing a short stint up at Hudson correctional?
that is one smart boy.
let me tell you.
how smart?
smart enough to maintain a 3. 45 GPA in the city's best prep school.
hell, if I had given a crap when I was actually in high school,
I could've gone on to be the successful lawyer type.
instead you went on to become the successful scumbag rapist type.
tomato, "tomahto."
still, you have to admire the ingenuity.
Frank had a couple of priors for forgery.
so we hatched a scheme to manufacture documents and enroll me in high school.
all so you could lure girls back to your house.
had to take advantage of Hank's boyish looks.
and with his charm, those girls were sitting ducks.
and when he "graduated," what then?
well, sky is the limit.
skip town, find a nice apartment near another Ivy League prep school.
but it all ended when Natalie Gerrard got the courage to tell Mr. Greggs what you had done to her.
I just heard some disturbing information, Jesse.
and before I call the police, I thought maybe I would give you a chance to respond.
once you hit him with the pepper spray he was an easy target.
but you had no intention of leaving that room with Robert Greggs alive.
how many other girls were there before Natalie?
I'm not gonna give it to you on a platter.
I choose to exercise my righto tremain silent.
we have your DNA on Natalie's dress.
her testimony, the makeup you wear to make yourself look younger, we have that on Robert Greggs' shirt;
we have photos of you two leaving the gym together.
you can exercise all the rights you want, but you're never going to see the light of day again.
well, we'll just have to see then, huh?
I'll take that lawyer now.
I've been on the job a long time, but I've never seen anything like this.
he talking?
a couple of admissions about his relationship with Mope number two in there and enrolling in the school, but now he's crying lawyer.
I'll tell you, his lack of remorse is chilling.
he doesn't seem even remotely sorry.
Yeah, your brain's got to be all kinds of screwed up to concoct something like that.
thank god it ended when it did.
God only knows how many other girls are too embarrassed to come forward.
your guy asking for a lawyer, too?
I can't get over how elaborate it was.
forged transcripts, standardized tests, fake letters from schools he never attended.
there's the halftime buzzer, but CBS Sports coverage continues.
hell of a game, Mess.
glad you could make it.
me, too. You should piss Lindsay off more often.
verne Lundquist and Bill Raftery with you here, and what an exciting evening of playoff action we've already seen, Bill.
the action is just beginning!
one lucky fan's seat number is about to be drawn at random, giving him one chance to sink a shot from half-court.
and walk away with $1 million, Verne!
I'm talking Benjamins!
never going to happen.
Why? You think you could do it? You kidding me?
boom. Nothing but net, baby.
section 214.
row E. Seat 5!
seat 5?!
that's me!
million dollars!
show me some sugar!
what's your name?
ready to take your shot at a million bucks, Dugan?
Oh, yeah!
all right, New York fans, let's get ready to cheer on Dugan Scott for the $1 million shot!
Oh, I think he can do it.
no, he can't.
want to make a little wager?
50 bucks.
I hate to take a colleague's money, but, for you, I will be happy to make the exception.
come on!
he did it! He did it!
Oh, my goodness!
I just saw it, and I still can't believe it!
and we have a winner - Dugan Scott,$1 million!
let him hear it!
I owe you ten.
Oh, my God!
call the paramedics.
ladies and gentlemen, for security purposes, please remain in your seats...
everybody, please stand back.
I've got a faint pulse.
...until further instructions, thank you.
clear.
no response.
300 joules. Clear again.
hold it right here, fellas.
NYPD. All right. You can go.
he just fell down.
no, nothing.
he's gone.
heart attack?
doesn't look like it.
hyperhidrosis, severe rashing, dilated pupils.
looks like some sort of poisoning.
it would have to be pretty fast-acting.
I mean, we just saw him run down here and sink that shot with our own eyes.
either way, looks like this game just went into overtime.
okay, so it turns out our vic, Dugan Scott, was a ten-year season ticket holder in seat E5.
he also picked up a couple drunk-and-disorderly tickets along the way.
anybody on the floor see anything?
spoke to a couple cheerleaders, refs, security staff.
all of them had their eyes glued to the basket until he hit the hardwood.
surprised he didn't kick the bucket from altitude sickness with these seats.
that or the nachos.
you know, maybe we should take a look at this scene from another angle.
this was a televised game, right? There were cameras all over the place?
if you could get us some footage, maybe we can get a better-detailed picture of what happened.
I'll make some calls.
I think I might be able to make a call right now.
this is somebody's blood.
it sure doesn't belong here.
and New York's Tough Talk continues.
I gotta tell you, between last night's playoff game getting cut short and the whole damn city getting shut down by this killer cabbie, we could all use a serious break.
shut it off!
who called it in?
anonymous tip to 911 at 5: 27 this morning.
no ID on the vic.
petechial hemorrhaging in the eyes.
cherry-red lividity, indicating CO poisoning.
the neck carvings are here, too.
looks like another Cabbie Killer victim.
same tarp as well...
except for these.
no ID on this either.
some kind of magnet?
sure looks like it.
you see something?
no, that's the problem.
what happened to the rest of the coins in this fountain?
NYPD.
to what do I owe the honor?
according to the Parks Department, you empty the fountain at Brill Park every morning.
Yeah, and Bethesda and Lincoln Center,
city Hall; that's my job.
you didn't notice a dead body there the last time you swept up?
listen, sweetheart, I've been cleaning fountains for this city for 18 years.
I lost track of how many dead bodies I've seen in that time.
all I know is, there was 50 pounds of change in that thing.
I had to empty it, before my homeless friends showed up to do it for me.
well, you tampered with a crime scene.
at least I called 911.
so once you've collected the change, what do you do with it?
clean it, sort it, turn it over to the city's general fund.
did you clean the Brill Park take yet?
no, it's still over there.
anything else I can do for you?
Yeah.
you can carry these down to the car.
you know, it's just this sort of thing that's always made me shy away from organized sports.
though, I do enjoy fencing.
you got a COD? Indeed.
but it's not quite as simple as a stab wound or gunshot.
it never is.
your victim succumbed rather quickly and painfully to atropine poisoning.
atropine. That comes from a plant, doesn't it?
atropa belladonna, also known as nightshade.
tox screen picked it up.
it's an herb used in a variety of medical products.
the berries and leaves are the most lethal components, and in this case, the poison was at a concentrated dosage that would've caused ventricular fibrillation inside of five minutes.
he died at halftime, so it must've happened inside the arena.
I didn't find any injection points, and his lung tissue's clear, so it wasn't inhalation.
well, that leaves...
contact or ingestion.
something corroded the area around his mouth.
any stomach contents?
like you wouldn't believe.
at least two hot dogs, popcorn, nachos, peanuts, an ice cream sandwich, and almost a full liter of beer.
I'm surprised he could get out of his seat.
what's even more surprising were the traces of phentermine I also found in his bloodstream.
wait, time-out. Scott was taking an appetite suppressant?
clearly a failure in this case, but someone still found him lovable.
lip prints.
12, to be exact.
I lifted them from both cheeks, the neck, and the forehead in various shades from Candy Kitten to Sangria Sunset.
12 girls on the cheerleading squad.
I also pulled a faint print from his mouth and then took a reference print from his own lips after washing.
anything else?
that's it for now.
okay, thanks, Sid. Yep.
all right, looks like the ball's in our court.
Hey, wait up a sec.
Where's the fire?
got work to do.
whoa. I was thinking that maybe we could, uh, we could talk.
now?
this isn't exactly the best time.
okay, fine.
you tell me when.
honestly, I don't know.
Hey, it's Reed. I'm about to put up a new blog post about the Cabbie Killer and I was hoping that maybe you could help me with some...
I gave you this number for personal, not professional reasons.
Yes, I know, but
I'm just trying to put together a real profile on this guy, you know?
I mean, don't you think that people have the right to know about who they're afraid of?
look, I'm impressed by your determination, Reed, maybe even a little bit proud, but you're a journalist and I'm a detective on this case.
you're crossing the line here.
Yes, but isn't that what lines are for?
not in my business.
come on. Throw me a bone, Mac.
good-bye, Reed.
well, you won't give 'em a story, then I will.
Hey, I got nothing from those cups and wrappers we collected from Dugan Scott's section, but I got a hit in CODIS on the blood splatter
I found on the seat.
came back to a Hudson Sports Arena concession salesman named Lamont Henford who just happened to get off parole last month.
and here's the real punch line.
apparently, he mixed it up with Dugan Scott in the stands two games ago.
Scott filed a formal complaint with security.
so you're thinking what? Henford hit back?
peanuts, popcorn, poison.
E5? Yeah, I served him.
way too many times for my taste.
how's your taste been affected by that fat lip?
listen, man, that guy was an ass.
drank like a rock star, tipped like a roadie, t I was used to that.
and then he just pushed me too damn far.
called me over for another beer.
from the way he looked, I should have kept walking, but I stopped and then he started.
check your zipper!
check your zipper!
check your zipper! Check your zipper!
I mean, embarrassed the hell out of me, you know?
but after he decked me,
I just got back up, said,"To hell with it.
seems awfully nice.
what happened next?
then I went home early. Had a few beers of my own.
as much as I wanted to kill that bastard,
I wasn't about to go back to jail for him.
that remains to be seen, pal.
detective Taylor, is the body you found at Brill Park another Cabbie Killer victim?
we're currently investigating that possibility.
there's been a lot of speculation lately about just who this serial killer really is.
can you speak to that at all?
can I speak to speculation? No.
just because you read it online or in the papers doesn't make it so.
the fact is there are a lot of dedicated investigators working extremely hard to stop this individual, whoever he is, from killing again.
as one of those forced to speculate in the absence of any real information being released by the NYPD,
I wonder if you can just tell me this, Detective Taylor:
would you take a New York City taxicab right now?
no, I wouldn't.
not until this killer is found and brought to justice.
no further questions.
detective Taylor, Detective Taylor.
are you crazy?
I've got a good mind to have the mayor hail himself a cab right now.
maybe you're crazy.
look, you can't allow one man to bring this entire city to a standstill.
jordan, one man put a bomb in his shoe, and now we all get to tiptoe barefoot through the airport.
Yeah, but that didn't cripple the airline industry.
look, I appreciate the inconvenience, but in my opinion, one more person dying at the hand of a murderer is one too many.
660, 000 people depend on taxis here every day.
they can walk or take the subway.
what about the 42, 000 cabbies out of work?
I'd rather be unemployed than dead.
well, that can be arranged.
jordan, you do your job. I'll do mine.
not if yours involves panicking the public.
let me ask you something.
are you gonna take responsibility for the next person killed in a cab?
I didn't think so.
??'re back. Let's take another call.
Yeah, listen, I walked 45 blocks today.
I'm ready to kill this Cabbie Killer.
I'm rerunning every possible database search on the ritualistic neck carvings:
addresses, transportation schedules, you name it.
whatever his code is, we just haven't cracked it yet.
all right, then let's step it out again.
our killer has claimed five victims.
two of them were real estate agents.
both found on the beach.
the first one almost survived.
there's the attorney from Jersey.
then we found the grad student.
he, like the others, was trapped in the back of the cab, fought to get out, but all ultimately died of carbon monoxide poisoning.
all the victims had the signature carvings on the back of the neck.
any additional information on the vic from the fountain?
nothing that ties her into the others.
I did find this.
it was in two pieces.
I'm guessing it came apart in the water.
lead composition, so it's probably old.
nothing pops up in any souvenir search thus far, but I'm thinking it could be tied to our killer.
well, maybe he tracked it in with him when he dumped the body at Brill Park.
I'll keep following it, see where it leads us.
excuse me.
want to go on a field trip?
where to?
kings County College.
analysis on the white trace
I pulled off our latest tarp came back as avian waste.
we got a million pigeons in this town. Yeah, but how many wild South American Quaker parrots do you think there are, hmm?
back in the late '60s, there was some crook working the tarmac at JFK unloading cargo planes.
he liked to keep some of the cargo for himself.
ly he got more than what he bargained for when he opened one from Argentina.
turns out it was packed full of parrots.
once they flew the coop, they took up roost here.
they've been multiplying in numbers and noise ever since.
I hear that.
so maybe our Cabbie Killer got his tarps from someplace in this vicinity.
those are the same tarps we found our bodies wrapped in, and they've been cut.
these tire treads are standard size.
they don't match any of the other construction rigs on the site.
they don't even look like they belong here.
looks like the fence was cut.
is this where our Cabbie Killer stops for supplies?
need help picking the right shade?
ha, ha, ha, that's just it.
unless the makeup counter at Bloomie's is selling mood lipstick, this partial print we got from our vic's mouth seems to have changed color.
it started out pink.
now it's amber.
means the efflorescent crystalline residue we're looking at is atropine trace.
that explains the color shift.
so which cheerleader wore it?
and if she had poison on her lips...
why isn't she dead, too?
Lindsay, focus on Paula Tolomeo, okay?
I just got a match on her lipstick print.
okay, but lipstick's not enough. We'll have to find more.
Hey, Mac.
we got a tread pattern match on the tire tracks we lifted from the fumigation site.
definitely not from the equipment we saw at King's College.
Goodfire steel-belted radials circa 2006.
distributor's list narrowed us down to eight New York cab companies that have bought them since then.
and what I just found out about our fountain magnet will narrow the search even further.
it's a dispatch button.
cab companies used to use it to track the locations of their taxis. Most cabs today are traced by GPS.
there can't be too many cab companies around still using magnets.
as a matter of fact, there's only one.
okay, we got a caller on the line who's a cabbie?!
used to be - now there's no work for any of us.
Yeah, we use it.
it's just some old school relic the owner's too cheap to take down.
you guys don't find this whack job any time soon, we're all going to be a bunch of relics.
H of relics.
like I said, found a magnet from this board at a crime scene.
any idea how it got there?
look around.
all I know is, we're not going anywhere.
especially some piece of junk from the shop.
think about it.
is there any other place these magnets are kept?
that's the only place I've ever seen them.
the ones we manage to pick up and stick back on anyway. What, they just fall off?
some hack knocked them off a few months back when he was pissed off over not making his month's lease.
punched a hole in the wall while he was at it.
real piece of work - that guy.
you got a name? An employment record?
are you kidding me?
you have any idea how many cabbies come and go through here on a daily basis?
half the time I can't even pronounce their names, much less write them down.
but if you want to go through my files... We will.
how about you show us that hole in the wall first?
rodrigo to the office. Rodrigo to the office.
is this what you're looking for?
that's exactly what we're looking for.
what is it, Hawkes?
I just got a case-to-case hit.
what?
so the DNA you got off the wall is a match to a blood sample from an unsolved murder case in Rochester.
you know what this means?
we got to get our hands on that evidence.
???
detective Taylor, is the body you found at Brill Park another Cabbie Killer victim?
we're currently investigating that possibility.
detective Taylor, are these murders connected?
need me? Yeah.
your Rochester evidence is being choppered in as we speak.
great. That DNA blood sample could be exactly the break we've been looking for.
hope you're right about that.
catching it from all sides, huh?
let's just say that between the media and the mayor's office
I should probably be wearing a flak jacket right about now.
we're closing in, Mac.
we're going to nail this guy. You know that.
whether we can do it on everyone else's schedule, that's another story.
people want this killer's head on a platter, and if they don't get it soon, they'll happily take mine instead.
what was it you once said?
Uh,"When the heat is on, you got to wear more sunblock.
I said that?
Mm-hmm.
think I was just back from vacation.
probably in a much better mood.
today I got a call from the widow of Ben Melvoy.
the attorney from Jersey.
they have a toddler and a newborn.
they were two weeks away from celebrating their tenth anniversary.
and then he gets into the wrong cab.
my God.
but you know what hit me the hardest?
she couldn't have been sweeter.
held it together, didn't even cry.
all she asked me to do is to stop this killer from hurting someone else.
but in spite of all the heartache, the bloodshed he's causing, the only thing I could really offer her was...
an apology.
are we going to get this guy?
we have to.
we have to.
there's the halftime buzzer...
row E.
Yeah! Whoo!
row E. Seat 5.
she announced a different seat number than the one she picked.
so much for our random drawing.
okay, the vic in the case-to-case search is a 28-year-old woman named Paige Lopez.
priors for prostitution.
witnesses saw her coming out of a bar with an ND male.
the Monroe County Sheriff's Department found her body two days later floating in the Genesee.
multiple defense wounds, so she definitely put up a fight.
cod was strangulation.
no carbon monoxide asphyxiation, but she did have the L2729 carvings on her neck.
so it's got to be our Cabbie Killer. Well, if it is, there's something seriously wrong with him.
this blood sample he left behind in the struggle is riddled with agranulocytosis.
Agranulated white blood cells... Yeah.
that's usually induced with exposure to drugs or radiation therapies.
a junkie maybe?
or a cancer patient?
I'll get this to tox.
see if it will tell us how sick this sicko really is.
this is her apartment, Detective.
Paula Tolomeo. NYPD.
we have a warrant to search the premises.
Hello?
nobody's home.
I don't know.
a lot of big books with big words for a cheerleader.
maybe she doesn't live alone.
this look a little big for her, no?
you hear anything about a roommate, perhaps?
super said she's the only tenant, but pro cheerleaders aren't exactly on the high end of the pay scale.
maybe she's subletting.
a lot of diet pills.
could explain the phentermine trace that Sid found on the vic.
not a lot of food.
I wonder if that's her roommate.
I found her secret garden,
I can tell you that much.
belladonna.
what's the other stuff?
looks like Calabar beans.
wait a minute. That's it.
she also made an antidote. There is one?
physostigmine. It comes from the Calabar bean.
ophthalmologists use it to contract their patients' pupils.
but she used it to stay alive.
Paula could've ground up the berries and the beans.
made two differe concentrated elixirs, then she refills the diet pills, one with poison, the other with antidote.
she would've had to swallow the antidote first to counteract the effects of the poison.
but then all she had to do was pop the other pill.
all right, New York fans, let's get ready to cheer on Dugan Scott for the $1 million shot!
let him hear it!
and the shot clock starts to tick.
talk about a personal foul.
all right, I'm with you on the "how,
but what about the "why"?
well, maybe our mystery girl can answer that.
you made up a story implying I was the source.
look, what do you want me to say?
I am getting 20, 000 hits a day.
people like to read my blog.
which is exactly why you should be more careful what you say.
we don't have time for careful, Mac.
we have a serial killer to catch.
no, Reed.
I have a serial killer to catch.
you just want a headline.
but I get it, so out of love and respect for your mother,
I'll give you an exclusive. You ready?
watch who you mess with.
is that a threat from you or from the killer?
both.
eat a salad.
eat a salad.
that's the chant he started.
it was two yrs ago but I can still feel the humiliation like it was yesterday.
section 214, row K, seat three.
eat a salad!
all Eat a salad!
eat a salad!
please stop.
my boyfriend was at that game.
he dumped me the very next day.
and because my fat face was on the big screen
complete strangers would come up to me telling me to "eat a salad.
so you chose to get back at Dugan Scott by killing him?
a crime of passion?
a crime of patience.
I worked my ass off.
literally.
I swore I would do whatever it took...
gastric bypass, liposuction, plastic surgery, tryout after tryout after tryout until I finally made the squad...
just so I could watch him eat his poison words in front of everyone.
I hope it was worth it.
because you just kissed your life good-bye.
Hey.
Hey. Where are you?
taking a rain walk.
it's a Montana thing.
you wouldn't understand.
Yeah, maybe I would.
maybe there's a lot of things that I...
that I understand now. How about that?
Yeah, like what?
how sorry I am for pushing you away.
Danny, I've tried to give you your space.
but I don't know how much longer I can feel alone.
it's messing with my work.
it's breaking my heart.
I know. No, I know. I do.
I swear to God it won't happen again.
cause the truth is...
truth is I miss you.
I miss you more than I can say, even if, uh, I don't know w to say it.
do you have any idea how hard you are to love?
why don't you come over here and tell me in person.
please.
I got to go.
so you got Tox results back on our Cabbie Killer's blood sample?
the agranulocytosis was caused by extremely high dosage of two different drugs: cloperidol and halzapine.
usually used to treat psychosis, right?
Yes, but only in clinical settings, and together only for acutely aggressive patients.
I've already done some checking.
there are three hospitals in the state currently using that cocktail for tough cases, but there was a fourth hospital that was shut down last year for all sorts of violations, including overmedicating their patients.
Yeah.
we got a briefing when they closed and had to release some of their patients early.
who are you calling?
the District Attorney.
I want to get a subpoena for the records of every patient let out of Mannix that was treated with both those drugs.
might take a while. I'll wait.
normally neighbors ask for sugar, but I thought I'd be daring and offer some first.
Hey, Rikki.
mind if I come in?
Rikki, listen, I been, uh,
I been thinking, you know, this thing, this thing between us...
you were right.
we made each other feel good.
but I'm starting to think it's bad.
it's a bad thing for us to do.
Danny, I'm moving.
you're moving?
I need a fresh start.
too many memories.
look...
I'm, uh... No.
don't say you're sorry.
just say good-bye.
good-bye.
good-bye.
Rikki, wait.
what about the sugar?
you're a sweet man.
you keep it.
the DA got a judge to wake up and sign the subpoena.
we've got the medical records of four patients who were released early from Mannix Asylum.
each of whom received the drugs we found in our killer's blood sample.
severe child abuse, multiple knife scars, maternal suicide, religious fanaticism.
this one looks pretty good for it. What's his name?
John Doe.
so even with all this information at our fingertips, we still don't have our killer's name.
all right, enough is enough.
I want both of you- Danny, Lindsay, Adam, Sid
every last person in this lab on this if we have to work double overtime and around the damn clock.
as far as I'm concerned, every other case goes to the bottom of the pile until we track this Cabbie Killer down and permanently put him out of business.
okay.
Oh, no!
you've got to be kidding me.
man, am I glad to see you.
ninth and Mercer.
I was supposed to meet some guy on that corner...
but I guess he's a, uh, a no-show, huh?
you could float away on a night like this.
you know what I mean?
Hello?
four seconds left on the shot clock.
lenkov passes to humphrey.
Humphrey hands it off to reiter.
reiter to callaway, an alley-oop!
it's another two-pointer for the new york empires!
there's the halftime buzzer, but cbs sports coverage continues.
hell of a game, mess.
glad you could make it.
me, too.
you should piss lindsay off more often.
verne lundquist and bill raftery with you here, and what an exciting evening of playoff action we've already seen, bill.
the action is just beginning!
one lucky fan's seat number is about to be drawn at random, giving him one chance to sink a shot from half-court.
and walk away with $1 million, verne!
I'm talking benjamins!
never going to happen.
Why? You think you could do it?
you kidding me?
boom.
nothing but net, baby.
section 214.
row E.
seat 5!
seat 5?!
that's me!
million dollars!
show me some sugar!
what's your name?
ready to take your shot at a million bucks, dugan?
Oh, yeah!
all right, new york fans, let's get ready to cheer on dugan scott for the $1 million shot!
Oh, I think he can do it.
no, he can'T.
want to make a little wager?
50 bucks.
I hate to take a colleague's money, but, for you, I will be happy to make the exception.
come on!
he did it! He did it!
Oh, my goodness!
I just saw it, and i still can't believe it!
and we have a winner-- dugan scott,$1 million!
let him hear it!
I owe you ten.
Oh, my god! Call the paramedics.
ladies and gentlemen, for security purposes, please remain in your seats...
everybody, please stand back.
I've got a faint pulse.
until further instructions, thank you.
clear.
no response. 300 joules.
clear again.
hold it right here, fellas.
NYPD.
all right. You can go.
he just fell down.
no, nothing.
he's gone.
heart attack?
doesn't look like it.
hyperhidrosis, severe rashing, dilated pupils.
looks like some sort of poisoning.
it would have to be pretty fast-acting.
I mean, we just saw him run down here and sink that shot with our own eyes.
either way, looks like this game just went into overtime.
Yeah, I want to get my money back on those tickets.
okay, so it turns out our vic, dugan scott, was a ten-year season ticket holder in seat e5.
he also picked up a couple drunk-and-disorderly tickets along the way.
anybody on the floor see anything?
spoke to a couple cheerleaders, refs, security staff.
all of them had their eyes glued to the basket until he hit the hardwood.
surprised he didn't kick the bucket from altitude sickness with these seats.
that or the nachos.
you know, maybe we should take a look at this scene from another angle.
this was a televised game, right?
there were cameras all over the place?
if you could get us some footage, maybe we can get a better-detailed ctpiure of what happened.
I'll make some calls.
I think I might be able to make a call right now.
this is somebody's blood.
it sure doesn't belong here.
and new york 'stough talk continues.
I gotta tell you, between last night's playoff game getting cut short and the whole damn city getting shut down by this killer cabbie, we could all use a serious break.
shut it off!
who called it in?
anonymous tip to 911 at 5: 27 this morning.
no id on the vic.
petechial hemorrhaging in the eyes.
cherry-red lividity, indicating co poisoning.
the neck carvings are here, too.
looks like another cabbie killer victim.
same tarp as well...
except for these.
no id on this either.
some kind of magnet?
sure looks like it.
you see something?
no, that's the problem.
what happened to the rest of the coins in this fountain?
NYPD.
to what do I owe the honor?
according to the parks department, you empty the fountain at brill park every morning.
Yeah, and bethesda and lincoln center, city hall; that's my job.
you didn't notice a dead body there the last time you swept up?
listen, sweetheart, I've been cleaning fountains for this city for 18 years.
I lost track of how many dead bodies I've seen in that time.
all I know is, there was 50 pounds of change in that thing.
I had to empty it, before my homeless friends showed up to do it for me.
well, you tampered with a crime scene.
at least I called 911.
so once you've collected the change, what do you do with it?
clean it, sort it, turn it over to the city's general fund.
did you clean the brill park take yet?
no, it's still over there.
anything else I can do for you?
Yeah. You can carry these down to the car.
you know, it's just this sort of thing that's always made me shy away from organized sports.
though, I do enjoy fencing.
you got a cod?
indeed.
but it's not quite as simple as a stab wound or gunshot.
it never is.
your victim succumbed rather quickly and painfully to atropine poisoning.
atropine. That comes from a plant, doesn't it?
atropa belladonna, also known as nightshade.
tox screen picked it up.
it's an herb used in a variety of medical products.
the berries and leaves are the most lethal components, and in this case, the poison was at a concentrated dosage that would've caused ventricular fibrillation inside of five minutes.
he died at halftime, so it must've happened inside the arena.
I didn't find any injection points, and his lung tissue's clear, so it wasn't inhalation.
well, that leaves...contact or ingestion.
something corroded the area around his mouth.
any stomach contents?
like you wouldn't believe.
at least two hot dogs, popcorn, nachos, peanuts, an ice cream sandwich, and almost a full liter of beer.
I'm surprised he could get out of his seat.
what's even more surprising were the traces of phentermine I also found in his bloodstream.
wait, time-out. Scott was taking an appetite suppressant?
clearly a failure in this case, but someone still found him lovable.
lip prints.
12, to be exact.
I lifted them from both cheeks, the neck, and the forehead in various shades from candy kitten to sangria sunset.
12 girls on the cheerleading squad.
I also pulled a faint print from his mouth and then took a reference print from his own lips after washing.
anything else?
that's it for now.
okay, thanks, sid.
Yep.
all right, looks like the ball's in our court.
Hey, wait up a sec.
Where's the fire?
got work to do.
I was thinking that maybe we could, uh, we could talk.
now?
this isn't exactly the best time.
okay, fine.
you tell me when.
honestly, I don't know.
Hey, it's reed.
I'm about to put up a new blog post about the cabbie killer and I was hoping that maybe you could help me with some...
I gave you this number for personal, not professional reasons.
Yes, I know, but I'm just trying to put together a real profile on this guy, you know?
I mean, don't you think that people have the right to know about who they're afraid of?
look, I'm impressed by your determination, reed, maybe even a little bit proud, but you're a journalist and I'm a detective on this case.
you're crossing the line here.
Yes, but isn't that what lines are for?
not in my business.
come on. Throw me a bone, mac.
good-bye, reed.
well, you won't give 'em a story, then I will.
according to high ranking sources at the NYPD crime lab new evidence has shed light on what kind of person the
Hey, I got nothing from those cups and wrappers we collected from dugan scott's section, but I got a hit in codis on the blood splatter I found on the seat.
came back to a hudson sports arena concession salesman named lamont henford who just happened to get off parole last month.
and here's the real punch line.
apparently, he mixed it up with dugan scott in the stands two games ago.
Scott filed a formal complaint with security.
so you're thinking what?
Henford hit back?
peanuts, popcorn, poison.
E5?
Yeah, I served him.
way too many times for my taste.
how's your taste been affected by that fat lip?
listen, man, that guy was an ass.
drank like a rock star, tipped like a roadie, but I was used to that.
and then he just pushed me too damn far.
called me over for another beer.
from the way he looked, I should have kept walking, but I stopped and then he started.
check your zipper!
check your zipper!
check your zipper! Check your zipper!
I mean, embarrassed the hell out of me, you know?
but after he decked me, I just got back up, said,"to hell with it.
seems awfully nice.
what happened next?
then I went home early. Had a few beers of my own.
as much as I wanted to kill that bastard,
I wasn't about to go back to jail for him.
that remains to be seen, pal.
detective taylor, is the body you found at brill park another cabbie killer victim?
we're currently investigating that possibility.
there's been a lot of speculation lately about just who this serial killer really is.
can you speak to that at all?
can I speak to speculation? No.
just because you read it online or in the papers doesn't make it so.
the fact is there are a lot of dedicated investigators working extremely hard to stop this individual, whoever he is, from killing again.
as one of those forced to speculate in the absence of any real information being released by the nypd,
I wonder if you can just tell me this, detective taylor:
would you take a new york city taxicab right now?
no, I wouldn'T.
not until this killer is found and brought to justice.
no further questions.
investigation possibilities can't speak to speculation stay out ot cabs are you crazy?
I've got a good mind to have the mayor hail himself a cab right now.
maybe you're crazy.
look, you can't allow one man to bring this entire city to a standstill.
jordan, one man put a bomb in his shoe, and now we all get to tiptoe barefoot through the airport.
Yeah, but that didn't cripple the airline industry.
look, I appreciate the inconvenience, but in my opinion, one more person dying at the hand of a murderer is one too many.
660, 000 people depend on taxis here every day.
they can walk or take the subway.
what about the 42, 000 cabbies out of work?
I'd rather be unemployed than dead.
well, that can be arranged.
jordan, you do your job. I'll do mine.
not if yours involves panicking the public.
let me ask you something.
are you gonna take responsibility for the next person killed in a cab?
I didn't think so.
and we're back. Let's take another call.
Yeah, listen, I walked 45 blocks today.
I'm ready to kill this cabbie killer.
I'm rerunning every possible database search on the ritualistic neck carvings:
addresses, transportation schedules, you name it.
whatever his code is, we just haven't cracked it yet.
all right, then let's step it out again.
our killer has claimed five victims.
two of them were real estate agents.
both found on the beach.
the first one almost survived.
there's the attorney from jersey.
then we found the grad student.
he, like the others, was trapped in the back of the cab, fought to get out, but all ultimately died of carbon monoxide poisoning.
all the victims had the signature carvings on the back of the neck.
any additional information on the vic from the fountain?
nothing that ties her into the others.
I did find this.
it was in two pieces.
I'm guessing it came apart in the water.
lead composition, so it's probably old.
nothing pops up in any souvenir search thus far, but I'm thinking it could be tied to our killer.
well, maybe he tracked it in with him when he dumped the body at brill park.
I'll keep following it, see where it leads us.
excuse me.
want to go on a field trip?
where to?
kings county college.
analysis on the white trace I pulled off our latest tarp came back as avian waste.
we got a million pigeons in this town.
Yeah, but how many wild south american quaker parrots do you think there are, hmm?
back in the late '60s, there was some crook working the tarmac at jfk unloading cargo planes.
he liked to keep some of the cargo for himself.
only he got more than what he bargained for when he opened one from argentina.
turns out it was packed full of parrots.
once they flew the coop, they took up roost here.
they've been multiplying in numbers and noise ever since.
I hear that.
so maybe our cabbie killer got his tarps from someplace in this vicinity.
those are the same tarps we found our bodies wrapped in, and they've been cut.
these tire treads are standard size.
they don't match any of the other construction rigs on the site.
they don't even look like they belong here.
looks like the fence was cut.
is this where our cabbie killer stops for supplies?
need help picking the right shade?
ha, ha, ha, that's just it.
unless the makeup counter at bloomie's is selling mood lipstick, this partial print we got from our vic's mouth seems to have changed color.
it started out pink.
now it's amber.
means the efflorescent crystalline residue we're looking at is atropine trace.
that explains the color shift.
so which cheerleader wore it?
and if she had poison on her lips...
why isn't she dead, too?
sexy...
but dangerous.
Lindsay, focus on paula tolomeo, okay?
I just got a match on her lipstick print.
okay, but lipstick's not enough.
we'll have to find more.
Hey, mac.
we got a tread pattern match on the tire tracks we lifted from the fumigation site.
definitely not from the equipment we saw at king's college.
Goodfire steel-belted radials circa 2006.
distributor's list narrowed us down to eight new york cab companies that have bought them since then.
and what I just found out about our fountain magnet will narrow the search even further.
it's a dispatch button.
cab companies used to use it to track the locations of their taxis.
most cabs today are traced by gps.
there can't be too many cab companies around still using magnets.
as a matter of fact, there's only one.
okay, we got a caller on the line who's a cabbie?!
used to be-- now there's no work for any of us.
Yeah, we use it.
it's just some old school relic the owner's too cheap to take down.
you guys don't find this whack job any time soon, we're all going to be a bunch of relics.
like I said, found a magnet from this board at a crime scene.
any idea how it got there?
look around.
all I know is, we're not going anywhere.
especially some piece of junk from the shop.
think about it. Is there any other place these magnets are kept?
that's the only place I've ever seen them.
the ones we manage to pick up and stick back on anyway.
what, they just fall off?
some hack knocked them off a few months back when he was pissed off over not making his month's lease.
punched a hole in the wall while he was at it.
real piece of work-- that guy.
you got a name? An employment record?
are you kidding me?
you have any idea how many cabbies come and go through here on a daily basis?
half the time I can't even pronounce their names, much less write them down.
but if you want to go through my files...
we will.
how about you show us that hole in the wall first?
rodrigo to the office.
rodrigo to the office.
is this what you're looking for?
that's exactly what we're looking for.
what is it, hawkes?
I just got a case-to-case hit.
what?
so the dna you got off the wall is a match to a blood sample from an unsolved murder case in rochester.
you know what this means?
we got to get our hands on that evidence.
damn right we do.
detective taylor, is the body you found at brill park another cabbie killer victim?
we're currently investigating that possibility.
detective taylor, are these murders connected?
need me?
Yeah.
your rochester evidence is being choppered in as we speak.
great. That dna blood sample could be exactly the break we've been looking for.
hope you're right about that.
catching it from all sides, huh?
let's just say that between the media and the mayor's office
I should probably be wearing a flak jacket right about now.
we're closing in, mac.
we're going to nail this guy. You know that.
whether we can do it on everyone else's schedule, that's another story.
people want this killer's head on a platter, and if they don't get it soon, they'll happily take mine instead.
what was it you once said?
Uh,"when the heat is on, you got to wear more sunblock.
I said that?
think I was just back from vacation.
probably in a much better mood.
today I got a call from the widow of ben melvoy.
the attorney from jersey.
they have a toddler and a newborn.
they were two weeks away from celebrating their tenth anniversary.
and then he gets into the wrong cab.
my god.
but you know what hit me the hardest?
she couldn't have been sweeter.
held it together, didn't even cry.
all she asked me to do is to stop this killer from hurting someone else.
but in spite of all the heartache, the bloodshed he's causing, the only thing I could really offer her was...
an apology.
are we going to get this guy?
we have to.
we have to.
row E.
row E.
seat 5.
she announced a different seat number than the one she picked.
so much for our random drawing.
okay, the vic in the case-to-case search is a 28-year-old woman named paige lopez.
priors for prostitution.
witnesses saw her coming out of a bar with an nd male.
the monroe county sheriff's department found her body two days later floating in the genesee.
multiple defense wounds, so she definitely put up a fight.
cod was strangulation.
no carbon monoxide asphyxiation, but she did have the l2729 carvings on her neck.
so it's got to be our cabbie killer.
well, if it is, there's something seriously wrong with him.
this blood sample he left behind in the struggle is riddled with agranulocytosis.
Agranulated white blood cells... - yeah.
that's usually induced with exposure to drugs or radiation therapies.
a junkie maybe?
or a cancer patient?
I'll get this to tox.
see if it will tell us how sick this sicko really is.
this is her apartment, detective.
Paula tolomeo. Nypd.
we have a warrant to search the premises.
Hello?
nobody's home.
I don't know.
a lot of big books with big words for a cheerleader.
maybe she doesn't live alone.
this look a little big for her, no?
you hear anything about a roommate, perhaps?
super said she's the only tenant, but pro cheerleaders aren't exactly on the high end of the pay scale.
maybe she's subletting.
a lot of diet pills.
could explain the phentermine trace that sid found on the vic.
not a lot of food.
I wonder if that's her roommate.
I found her secret garden, I can tell you that much.
belladonna.
what's the other stuff?
looks like calabar beans.
wait a minute.
that's it.
she also made an antidote.
there is one?
physostigmine. It comes from the calabar bean.
ophthalmologists use it to contract their patients' pupils.
but she used it to stay alive.
Paula could've ground up the berries and the beans.
made two different concentrated elixirs, then she refills the diet pills, one with poison, the other with antidote.
she would've had to swallow the antidote first to counteract the effects of the poison.
but then all she had to do was pop the othepir ll .
all right, new york fans, let's get ready to cheer on dugan scott for the $1 million shot!
let him hear it!
and the shot clock starts to tick.
talk about a personal foul.
all right, I'm with you on the "how," but what about the "why"?
well, maybe our mystery girl can answer that.
you made up a story implying I was the source.
look, what do you want me to say?
I am getting 20, 000 hits a day.
people like to read my blog.
which is exactly why you should be more careful what you say.
we don't have time for careful, mac.
we have a serial killer to catch.
no, reed.
I have a serial killer to catch.
you just want a headline.
but I get it, so out of love and respect for your mother,
I'll give you an exclusive. You ready?
watch who you mess with.
is that a threat from you or from the killer?
both.
if u want 2 know more about the cabbie killer meet me@the corner of hudson&franklin tonight @10pm
eat a salad.
eat a salad.
that's the chant he started.
it was two years ago but I can still feel the humiliation like it was yesterday.
section 214, row k, seat three.
eat a salad!
eat a salad!
eat a salad!
eat a salad!
please stop.
my boyfriend was at that game.
he dumped me the very next day.
and because my fat face was on the big screen
complete strangers would come up to me telling me to "eat a salad.
so you chose to get back at dugan scott by killing him?
a crime of passion?
a crime of patience.
I worked my ass off.
literally.
I swore I would do whatever it took...
gastric bypass, liposuction, plastic surgery, tryout after tryout after tryout until I finally made the squad...
just so I could watch him eat his poison words in front of everyone.
I hope it was worth it.
because you just kissed your life good-bye.
Hey.
Hey. Where are you?
taking a rain walk.
it's a montana thing.
you wouldn't understand.
Yeah, maybe I would.
maybe there's a lot of things that I...that I understand now.
how about that?
Yeah, like what?
how sorry I am for pushing you away.
Danny, I've tried to give you your space.
but I don't know how much longer I can feel alone.
it's messing with my work.
it's breaking my heart.
I know. No, I know. I do.
I swear to god it won't happen again.
cause the truth is...
truth is I miss you.
I miss you more than I can say, even if, uh, I don't know how to say it.
do you have any idea how hard you are to love?
why don't you come over here and tell me in person.
please.
I got to go.
so you got tox results back on our cabbie killer's blood sample?
the agranulocytosis was caused by extremely high dosage of two different drugs:
cloperidol and halzapine.
usually used to treat psychosis, right?
Yes, but only in clinical settings, and together only for acutely aggressive patients.
I've already done some checking.
there are three hospitals in the state currently using that cocktail for tough cases, but there was a fourth hospital that was shut down last year for all sorts of violations, including overmedicating their patients.
Mannix asylum. - Yeah.
we got a briefing when they closed and had to release some of their patients early.
who are you calling?
the district attorney.
I want to get a subpoena for the records of every patient let out of mannix that was treated with both those drugs.
might take a while.
I'll wait.
normally neighbors ask for sugar, but I thought I'd be daring and offer some first.
Hey, rikki.
mind if I come in?
Rikki, listen, I been, uh, I been thinking, you know, this thing, this thing between us...
you were right.
we made each other feel good.
but I'm starting to think it's bad.
it's a bad thing for us to do.
Danny, I'm moving.
you're moving?
I need a fresh start.
too many memories.
I'm, uh...
no.
don't say you're sorry.
just say good-bye.
good-bye.
good-bye.
Rikki, wait.
what about the sugar?
you're a sweet man.
you keep it.
the da got a judge to wake up and sign the subpoena.
we've got the medical records of four patients who were released early from mannix asylum.
each of whom received the drugs we found in our killer's blood sample.
severe child abuse, multiple knife scars, maternal suicide, religious fanaticism.
this one looks pretty good for it.
what's his name?
John doe.
so even with all this information at our fingertips, we still don't have our killer's name.
all right, enough is enough.
I want both of you-- danny, lindsay, adam, sid -
every last person in this lab on this if we have to work double overtime and around the damn clock.
as far as I'm concerned, every other case goes to the bottom of the pile until we track this cabbie killer down and permanently put him out of business.
okay.
Oh, no! You've got to be kidding me.
man, am I glad to see you.
ninth and mercer.
I was supposed to meet some guy on that corner...
but I guess he's a, uh, a no-show, huh?
you could float away on a night like this. You know what I mean?
Hello?
get your hands up right now.
right now!
turn around.
I said turn around. Come on.
do it!
okay, all right, turn around.
come on.
the case.
slide it over.
razor knife?
what, you think I'm stupid, huh?
this stays with me.
come on. Let's go.
let's go!
he's, uh...
he's in there.
you know the deal.
come on, keep coming to me, keep coming to me!
we gotcha, we gotcha.
one end around your ankle, the other end around that bag.
do it!
you expect me to believe you didn't kill him?
I didn't.
this man was dead before I got here.
now prove it.
NYPD, coming through!
how many has he got inside?
maybe a dozen. I can't get an accurate count.
here's what I know.
employees were just showing up for work when our perp enters the bank cowboy-style.
get on the ground! On the ground! Everybody on the ground!
gets everyone on the ground, then heads toward the open vault, at which point a teller trips a silent alarm.
the response is immediate, trapping the perp inside, which is when he decides to go "Dog Day Afternoon."
got an ID? All we know is he's male, white, approximately 40 years old, armed and definitely dangerous.
he already killed someone inside.
he shot a hostage?
details are sketchy, but the witnesses who got out say they heard a gunshot, then saw a body down on the floor in the vault.
geez.
Where's Mac?
with the body. Oh, you gotta be kidding.
this ain't your everyday bank robbery, Stella.
this guy made three demands:
unmarked police car, no press, and somebody from Crime Scene.
he wanted one of us?
he swears he didn't kill the guy inside, and he wants someone in there to prove he's not a murderer.
so Mac agreed to meet one of his demands...
in exchange for a hostage.
Oh, this guy is smart.
now he's got a cop for insurance.
what is it?
I need to use a computer, send these crime scene photos back to my lab to be analyzed.
how are pictures of a dead guy gonna prove I'm innocent? They're a permanent record of the crime scene in its original condition, and I can't start processing the body or have my team analyze evidence without this type of documentation.
Hey, Ruben.
listen...
what the hell is that idiot doing?
get him back here!
Dennison, Chavez, get that guy out of there!
use this computer right here.
no tricks.
I'm watching you.
you got a name?
what's your real name?
all you need to know is that it's Joe.
Yeah.
what?
no, how did you...?
no, that's not... that's not... that's...
no, but that's not true.
no, that's... that's not what happened...
it's not what you think.
just let me...
hold on. Hold on. Just calm down, all right?
I can hear you.
you have to understand, I don't care what it is that you think that you saw, but it... it's not what you think, all right?
you a cop? --Yeah.
get us the hell out of here.
please...
I'm three months pregnant.
I don't want to die.
I don't care what you saw.
that's not what happened.
have I told you how much I love the media?
mac just sent over these photos from the crime scene.
our vic is male, approximately 45 years old.
looks like a single gunshot wound.
let's put him in front of some witnesses.
maybe we can get an ID.
Oh, my God.
that's Walter Sutherford, the bank manager.
tell me, did you see Mr. Sutherford engage the gunman?
no, I heard someone say they saw a body in the vault, but I didn't see Mr. Sutherford get shot.
thank you. Thanks.
of all the witnesses who got out, no one saw our bad guy pull the trigger.
that's Mac's job.
I'll send someone to Sutherford's house to make the notification.
detectives. Where are we at with the surveillance tapes?
one of my guys just talked to the main branch just a few minutes ago.
the surveillance feed is piped right into the manager's office.
okay, so Mac has access to them.
if the gunman lets him.
got NY Power ready to shut down the juice.
Oh, you can't do that.
mac is still processing the scene.
Hey, detective.
all due respect, that's an active crime scene.
if we're not gonna make entry, we've got to do something.
making it uncomfortable for this guy is our only leverage.
I understand that, but see, if you turn off the air, that body will start decomposing so fast we'll lose all our evidence.
and maybe our only chance of resolving this peacefully.
then tell Detective Taylor to work a little faster.
he's got two hours to process.
then we're gonna start getting proactive, all right?
what are you looking for?
foreign DNA.
evidence left behind by an attacker.
this man has defensive wounds.
indicates there was a struggle.
how long you been married?
I was married once.
it's nice to have someone who cares about you.
you think you're gonna get into my head, detective?
is that it?
bring up my wife.
tell me how much she loves me and how...
I shouldn't be doing this.
all I'm getting at is if you didn't kill this man, then maybe this can still work out in your favor.
no, it'll work out.
you do your job correctly, it'll work out.
it's him.
yeah?
Where's my police car?
we're working on it.
I got a mechanic disabling the GPS per your request.
I can still see the media.
I thought I told you to get 'em out of here.
look, we're trying.
but you and I both know this is the best game in town and people want to watch.
Ah, well, then let's hope the kids are out of the room when I start tossing bodies in your direction.
come on, pal.
you don't want to do that.
you said yourself you haven't killed anybody.
yet.
but if you provoke me, so help me God...
tell you what.
you send a hostage out,I'll bend some arms out here and get you what you want.
I'll think about it.
what?
what? What now?
I'm going to need to test you for gunshot residue.
how's that work?
I collect with one of these.
positive result tells me you fired your gun recently.
don't waste your time.
I- I-I did.
everybody on the ground!
was that the only time you fired your weapon?
that's right.
one shot.
from over there.
this could have been an accident.
no, it wasn't an accident.
I'm not going to let you pin his murder on me.
calm down, Joe. No one's doing that.
you don't think I know what's going on out there?
your friends are out there trying to figure out a way to get in here without killing a lot of innocent people.
they don't give a damn about me.
cause they think I'm a murderer.
you know what that means?
that means they'll put a bullet in me the first chance they get.
that's why I'm not leaving here until you prove that I didn't pull the trigger.
and if I'm not leaving, nobody's leaving.
well, then get me a CT scanner.
what's that?
it's a kind of a lie detector for scientists.
it'll allow me to look inside the body and see if you're telling me the truth.
I got you your scanner
liquid refreshments for the guests.
come on, get to work.
it's going to be a little hard with this bag slowing me down.
too bad.
you know, the faster I get this done, the sooner you get what you want.
it's up to you.
I'm going to need some help getting this out of here.
you.
give him a hand.
go give him a hand.
could you put that over there?
where do you guys keep the surveillance tapes?
they're recorded on a hard drive in our manager's office.
...it is in chaos today, with the NYPD blocking off many of the streets...
Hey, Sid. We hear from Mac?
Yeah, Stella just did.
he couldn't say much.
but he sent over some CT scan data to perform a virtual autopsy.
Yeah. Finally get to break in that new toy of yours.
step into my lair.
let's do it.
looks like we've got two distinct wound cavities.
both rounds entered the thoracic cavity between the fourth and fifth ribs.
dense tissue resulted in a great deal of fragmentation that penetrated into both the mediastinum and the pleural cavity.
with one large projectile lodging in the inferior lobe of the right lung and a second lodging into the left ventricle of the heart.
the latter of which resulted in near-instantaneous death.
this entrance wound is consistent with a medium-size caliber, . 45 or. 38.
that's weird.
I only see one entry wound.
there's got to be another one.
that is strange.
there doesn't appear to be a second.
split wound path from a single round?
my first thought as well.
but the permanent wound cavities are too large, and take a look at this.
guy's got more metal in him than a jewelry store.
right. And based on cumulative mass estimates,
I'd say we're looking at two rounds.
how does someone get shot twice in exactly the same place?
that's not scientifically possible, Mac.
unless there was one round stuck in the barrel when the trigger was pulled.
well, in that case, the two bullets would be deformed in different ways, changing their aerodynamics, causing them to take on different flight paths.
maybe both rounds were shot from close range.
except I got no sign of stippling or powder burns on the body.
intermediate range then.
there's no way.
the weapon's recoil would jar the shooter's hand enough to easily throw off the second shot.
even a highly skilled marksman would be off by a couple of millimeters.
maybe it's not about skill or luck.
maybe it's about the gun.
was Sid able to determine caliber?
Yeah, Sid thinks that the murder weapon was a medium caliber.
is that what your suspect is holding? Yeah.
but my guy swears he only fired one round into the ceiling and insists there's no way it's his bullet inside the vic.
if that's the truth, then there would have been three rounds fired in that bank.
then why didn't any witnesses hear more than one shot?
Mac? What happened?
he hung up. Listen, what do you want me to do about Jackson?
he's breathing down my neck about going in.
stall him. Where are you going?
to find out how our gunman pulled off the impossible.
I fired one shot at that ceiling.
I don't want to have to tell you again.
that's not what the evidence is telling us.
I swear to you. I swear to you, man!
I did not kill this guy!
then who did?--- I don't know!
what the hell is going on here, Joe?
you're not telling me everything.
you got partners, don't you?
maybe you're the fall guy.
who was that you were talking to on the phone earlier?
you know what? I'm, I am sick and tired of answering all your questions.
now you go in there and you prove, you find something that proves that I did not kill this guy!
I've only got one problem with that.
under normal circumstances,
I would perform an autopsy on the body to confirm cause of death, run ballistics.
a bullet from your gun against the bullets inside the body...
I don't see the problem.
you got one of my bullets lying around here someplace. Yeah, if we can find it.
that still doesn't give me the bullets inside the body.
for that I got to send the body back to autopsy.
okay, so where you could conveniently find "evidence " that connects me to his murder.
forget it. The body is not going anywhere.
well, then you're out of luck because I need the bullets inside the body.
huh?
okay.
start digging.
... police vehicles and officers have surrounded the area within a two-block radius...
we're looking for a small mushroom-shaped piece of metal.
if you find it, it's very important you do not touch it or move it.
just call me and I'll come and collect it.
you still there, Sid?
I'm here.
you sure you're okay, Mac?
I'm fine.
any time you're ready.
okay.
first thing I'm going to need you to do is make a single long incision across the upper abdominal region.
this will allow you to go underneath the ribcage.
once you've made the incision, you're going to probe with your hand into the center of the chest cavity.
use your fingers to feel for the heart.
you should feel a hole in that bottom left quadrant.
I feel it.
now, squeeze the tissue.
the round should slip out, into your fingers.
I got it.
good.
go back in through the same incision, but this time feel for the right lung.
use the ribcage as your guide.
Mac's crime scene photos give us anything?
Yeah, I got a small void in the blood pool.
approximately...
3x5 inches.
means something was removed from the scene after the vic was shot.
maybe stack of cash?
negative.
whatever it is, if the hostage taker has it, it could tie him to the murder.
Danny, take a look at these.
mac sent over six bogeys.
there's nothing but bank and bad lighting.
blow this one up.
as much as you can without ghosting it.
you see that reflection?
he's got something in his hand.
looks like a gun.
that's our hostage taker.
Mac's trying to help us ID the son of a bitch.
Adam, enhance the bogeys and stitch them together.
if we can ID our gunman, maybe we can get someone from his family down to the bank and talk some sense into him.
mac, it should be within reach.
I can feel the second bullet.
got it.
I found the bullet!
nobody touch it!
well, do you think it'll work?
maybe.
yeah?
Yeah, I'm trying.
it's not that easy.
Yeah, no. Listen, I understand.
the negotiator said they'll give me what I want.
I don't know what's taking so long.
listen, I'm trying, but it's not easy...
I said I'm trying.
please, just trust me, all right? I'll be...
just don't, please.
please...
I've been watching it on the news.
they said one person's already been killed.
male DB. Gunshot wound to the chest.
there's two bullets inside the body and only one entry wound.
how do you know that?
crime scene hasn't been released yet.
I don't believe it. You've got a man on the inside. Mac Taylor.
it was one of the gunman's demands.
mac went in through the back door so the press wouldn't see. In exchange, he was able to negotiate the release of one of the hostages.
and you're worried about him.---I'm worried sick.
look, Brett, I need your help.
no one knows weapons like you do.
so you got a victim with one entry wound, but two bullets inside of him. Yeah.
basically, I'm looking for the impossible.
a murder weapon that can fire two rounds near instantaneously without any recoil.
don't tease me---Follow me.
it's called the Kriss Super V.
45 caliber.
every time you fire, the recoil energy produced is vectored downward into a spring-loaded receiver instead of backward into the shooter's body.
takes the kick right out of kickback. Hmm.
end result: a highly accurate shot each time this bad boy's fired.
how did our gunman get his hands on this kind of cutting-edge technology?
Joe, this isn't going to work.
the bullets are too damaged.
there's no way to include or exclude your weapon.
what, so you've just been, just...
you've just been stringing me along?!
you've just been wasting my time?! Just wait.
just get!
get on the floor, man!
get on the floor with the others!
wait! Wait a minute!
this isn't over. What? What, have you got any other science tricks up your sleeve?!
just one. Just one.
witnesses said you walked in the bank this morning right when it opened---That's right.
what time was that?
0.00625
Wh...?
where are you going?
wait. Hey!
I'm talking to you.
what is that?
blood.
we got to talk.
about what?
the money you took.
where is it?
your partner take it?
is that who's been calling you, Joe?
I don't have a partner, man.
then where's the money?
the money was here.
it was taken right after this guy was shot. Where is it? ---Listen, man,
I never had a chance to grab anything.
your friends were here before I even had a chance to fill a bag.
where are you going? --Did anyone see Joe take any money out of this vault?
Hey, stay... get away from them.
let them answer the question. Did anyone see Joe remove money from the vault?
Messer. Danny, it's Mac.
Hey, how you doing, boss? You all right?
Yeah, I'm good.
I took a look at the security footage from inside the bank.
the cameras were disconnected at a few minutes before 8: 00 this morning. That's a full hour before witnesses say your gunman rolled in and started making noise.
Yeah, that's not all.
I got a spatter void and money missing from the vault, which could only mean one thing.
the bank was already robbed once today.
and the vic could be a casualty from that heist.
makes your suspect one of the unluckiest mooks on the planet.
or maybe it's not a coincidence.
what if this isn't about money, but something else?
for those of you just joining us this morning, our top story...
Hey, heard Stella might have found our murder weapon.
Yeah, it sounds like it.
she wants everybody on a telepresence call.
okay, we have a full house; network's secure. You're good to go, Stella.
great, thanks.
I just met with Agent Dunbar from Homeland Security.
we managed to identify what I believe is the type of weapon used to kill our victim earlier today.
it's called a Kriss Super V.
now, I'm sending over our reconstruction videos and specs as we speak.
they're coming to your screens now.
the weapon is a limited production gun.
it's manufactured by Ridgeline Defense Services.
Lindsay, I want you to reach out to the manufacturer.
ask about inventory.
see if there's one missing or stolen.
I want to know how our killer got his hands on the gun.
Sid, send over the CT scan data that Mac took to Hawkes.
let's get a close-up image of one of the fragments.
if we can extrapolate the number of lands and grooves, we can match class characteristics to this make of weapon. You got it.
all right, that's all I got.
I'm going back to the bank.
Flack? What is it?
this just turned into a doubleheader.
one of my guys went over to our vic's house to talk to his wife and make the notification, and found another body.
blood's still wet.
Tod can't be more than a couple of hours ago.
well, that rules out our bank robber.
not unless ???
the manager's wife?
she was shot right through the forehead, execution-style. ---When?
not more than a couple hours ago.
either Joe's been a very busy man this morning or he's working with someone on the outside.
something's not making sense.
you guys got witnesses out there who say they saw the gunman enter the bank alone, and they only heard one shot.
but there's money missing, two bullets inside the vic from a Kriss Super V, and I'm staring at our guy's standard. 45.
someone else was in that bank.
Hey! You heard the woman.
someone else was in here.
and like you said, things aren't adding up.
you call whoever it is that you need to call, and you tell them that I didn't murder anyone.
call!
I can't do that.
all I got is a theory and your word.
you know, I'm beginning to regret asking for the CSI.
let me tell you.
wait a minute.
if I can get these bullets back to my lab, and they match the bullet that killed the manager's wife,...then I'll know what you're telling me is the truth.
done.
what else?
I want this evidence taken out of here by one of the hostages.
forget it.
then I'm done.
either you give me something I want, or you can take these bullets across the street yourself.
get up, come here.
I want her.
time's up, detective.
we need more.
but this guy's been playing us for three hours now.
sooner or later he's going to figure out we're not giving in to the rest of his demands.
and it's going to get pretty bloody in there, unless we can make things difficult for him.
this guy's not a shooter.
there's something else going on.
we need more time---Time's not what you give to a hostage taker, detective.
30 minutes. 30 minutes and then it's your show.
all right, 30, starting now.
after that, I'm taking the first steps towards ending this thing.
Flack, front door. Heads up. We got movement.
everybody stand down.
stand down! Stand down!
Adderly, go get her.
this way. It's all right. It's all right.
it's all right. It's all right.
it's all right. You're going to be okay.
it's all over. What's your name?
uh, Lori Mandel. I'm one of the tellers.
Lori, how are the rest of the people inside the bank?
uh... they're fine.
the man with the gun said they'll stay that way as long as Detective Taylor does his job.
I thought Mac was sending over ballistic evidence.
he did, but this hair was in there with it.
you think he put that there intentionally?
you ever known Mac to do anything unintentionally?
Mac's giving us this evidence to try and identify the gunman.
cross section is ovoid.
length is short with heavy granulation of the medulla.
so it's a Caucasian male with black hair.
Yeah, matches the description of our gunman.
I'll see if I can get a DNA profile and I'll run it through CODIS.
Yeah, I'm running out of time here.
they want to shut down the power in the bank.
won't be long before this comes to a head.
what do you got?
I just left Adam in DNA.
the hair Mac sent over from the gunman didn't do anything.
no hit in CODIS or the national database.
Yeah, that's no surprise.
nothing about this guy says he's a pro.
what about ballistics from the two crime scenes?
I compared the bullets Mac pulled from the bank manager to the bullet recovered from the wife; they match.
so ballistics and time of death make it impossible for Joe to be our shooter.
I was able to pull a print off the duct tape used to bind the manager's wife.
it came back to a Derrick James.
he's an ex-employee of Ridgeline Defense Services.
that's how he got his hands on a Kriss Super V.
what else do we know about this guy?
black male, 35 years old.
he spent three years in Iraq doing private security.
no criminal record.
all right, run through it with me.
this James guy kidnaps the bank manager and then ties up his wife.
then he brings the manager to the bank an hour before it opens.
gets the manager to open up the vault, takes whatever he can get.
but something obviously went wrong and this Derrick James shoots the manager.
leaves the bank, decides to kill the wife to cover his tracks.
all right, all the evidence points that way.
one question: How is Joe involved in all this?
what? Hey? What...
what the hell is going on?
what? Whoa. What's going on?
hostage Rescue is getting restless.
they're not gonna sit out there doing nothing all day, Joe.
yeah?
yeah?
I want you to turn the power back on.
Now--- It's out of my hands, Joe.
I'll tell you what, though.
you release one more hostage and I'll see that the situation returns to my hands.
listen to me very carefully.
if you don't turn on the power in one minute...
I'll give you a hostage, but you better call the morgue to come pick her up.
no, no, no, no, no.
no more threats.
the power stays off until we get another hostage.
call your friend.
tell him to turn the power back on.
come on. Enough is enough, Joe.
tell me what's going on.
you say you didn't kill the manager.
the evidence seems to support that, but if you want my help, you've got to tell me how you got in this position.
we're not at the point of no return, Joe.
this doesn't have to end badly.
I know right now you feel trapped, but I can still help you.
don't move!
don't you move!
hands behind your head.
get up. Get up.
keep moving!
please. Please.
they'll kill my family!
you can't walk me out there.
they're watching.
they'll kill my family.
I'm the hostage here. You gotta believe me.
my real name is Douglas Anderson. I work for an insurance company. Now, if they see you walk me out of this bank, they'll kill my family.
who's they?
I- I don't know their names.
the bank manager, Walter,
I live across the street from the guy.
it's terrible.
just another ordinary day.
I kissed my wife and daughter, leave the house to hit the gym before going to work.
have a good day at school.
Bye, sweetheart. See you tonight, okay?
Bye, Daddy!
get in the house!
Hey, hey, hey! Don't hurt them!
they tied my wife and daughter up and said that if I don't do what they told me, they'd kill them.
they wanted you to rob this bank?
the evidence says they already robbed it.
and apparently they got away.
why would they want you to rob the same bank an hour later?
they left their phone behind.
Yeah.
they said that, uh, Walter tried to play hero.
Yeah, I'm in. Everything is cool.
just sit tight, and I'll be out of here in 30 seconds.
must've shot his wife after that.
and forced you to go back in to retrieve the phone.
everybody on the ground.
except by then the bank had already opened...
everybody on the ground!
...I had no choice.
and you've been in contact with the original bank robbers the whole time.
they're waiting for me......to get out of here with... with their phone.
it's the only thing that links them to this robbery.
they said that if I just give their phone back to them,
I get my family back.
I need...
to get out of here.
I need for them to see me get out of here.
would you help me?
please.
they're coming out.
bring in the car.
you sure about this?
mac knows what he's doing.
all right, what now?
all right, cameras are gonna follow them, so we need to hang back a bit, but we got to get to this guy's family before they do.
there's a chopper standing by for us in the next intersection.
good, because I don't think the real bank robbers have any intention of leaving witnesses behind, and that includes Mac.
let's go.
what are they doing?
what? Are they following us?
we can't pull up to the house with the cameras on us.
cause if-if they see this on the news, my wife and daughter are-are... they're dead.
this is Detective Taylor.
get those news choppers out of here now.
it's going to be fine, Doug.
my team's on it.
they're the best at what they do.
NYPD!
go, go, go!
perimeter is secure.
clearly there is no one here.
this place is empty.
take the next left.
no, no, it's quicker if we go...
you kept a bullet.
let's get you out of here.
take the bridge.
it was all a lie, wasn't it?
something gotta change
thank you.
all right, let's give it up for Maroon 5, everybody.
come on, let's hear it.
thank you for coming out to the Central Park concert...
Hey, get off me! - Hey, what's going on?
come on! Get out of here!
go! Let's go!
police! Get up! Let's go!
step away from the officer!
officer down! Officer gone down!
I got one here!
it was a free concert in the park by Maroon 5.
must've been one hell of a show.
our vic is Liza Carpenter.
a first year Asian Studies major at Triborough College.
stumbled out in front of the crosstown bus as it was leaving the stop.
the bus didn't kill her.
look where it is in relation to the bus stop.
what is that, ten feet?
Yeah, there's no way it could've been going fast enough to do this.
looks like a crushed trachea.
the riot squad use 37 millimeter soft rounds?
Yeah, beanbags for crowd control.
this place went from a sing-along to a slugfest in about 60 seconds.
come on, you're not saying that one of our guys is gonna take the heat for this?
not saying anything... yet.
you think that's the round that hit her?
it could've gotten caught in her clothing.
she got hit in the throat with a round.
she couldn't breathe, stumbled out of the park into the street, and then...
this is where she died.
you guys know these rounds are designed not to kill.
it's not our job to tell you what you want to hear, Flack.
once we sort through the evidence, our findings may rule out misconduct or excessive force.
or they may not.
I get it.
it's just that, you know, these guys don't have an easy job out there.
neither do we.
Oh, no.
do we know the source? - Not yet.
what about the level of exposure?
we're about to find out.
don't come any closer.
we don't know what we're dealing with here.
you sure it's radiation?
it wasn't the beanbag that killed her, I can tell you that much.
all right, we need to move that body to out Exposure Control facility, then test all personnel who've come in contact with her for possible contamination.
that would include you and me.
your contact was limited.
I'm guessing you'll be clear.
besides, this radiation isn't airborne, and her clothing levels seem safe.
it's her skin that reads hot.
suggesting her contamination was transdermal.
the paint on her skin was refractive.
could've been laced with radioactive salts of some kind.
we gotta find the source and contain it fast.
safety protocol demands we call the Centers for Disease Control first, then we secure the body, quarantine this area, and move quickly to isolate and protect all exposed individuals.
not before we get Sid to a hospital.
no, I'll be fine, Mac.
we can't let him out yet.
we're not sure about his level of contamination.
and even though it's not airborne, we're making a big guess about the method of transmission.
Mac! - Mac, stand back! Stand back!
get the CDC here now!
all right, Sid, you're going to fine, okay?
listen, you're going to be okay.
we're going to take care of you. You'll be okay.
I'm not getting unhealthy readings on either of you.
do we have any idea what kind of radiation he was poisoned with?
not yet. - Mac.
I checked with the M. E. 's office.
I'm gonna cover for for Sid in Autopsy at least till we get a lid on this.
has the vic's body been moved to the Exposure Control Facility?
as we speak.
follow her and stay focused on how she ended up there in the first place.
done. All right, let's go!
what's the status on her clothing and personal effects?
cdc wants to clear everything before they release it back to the lab, but as soon as they do, I'm on it.
all right, in the meantime, I want you both on that paint job of hers.
if it is the source of our contamination, time is of the essence.
you got something?
actually, yeah, I do. It's called "shriiimping.
Shrimping?
only they spell it with three "I's." It's a lot like tagging.
graffiti? - But for people.
you actually got an ID on the artist who painted her?
investigation is its own art form.
I ran the art we found on our vic through GRAFFITISTAT database and it came up with a name:
kenneth Bamford, aka Ka-Blam.
fortunately, this guy might've changed his canvas, but he did not lose his style.
or his record.
Yeah, okay, I recognize her.
but I'm telling you right now she didn't look like that when I shrimped her.
and when was that?
a couple days ago, I guess.
I paint a lot of girls.
maybe you're interested.
I'm only interested in finding out what happened to this one.
we didn't pick up significant radioactive trace on you or your studio.
did you make contact with her in any other way?
I like the way you think, but no.
she wasn't my type.
did she complain about not feeling well when you were with her?
nobody complains when I'm shrimping them.
so you didn't notice anything strange about her at all?
no, I mean not particularly.
I mean, her complexion wasn't that great, but every canvas is different.
and anyways, I knew she'd leave looking a lot better than she did when she got here.
right, right, right, right.
what kind of paint do you use when shrimp?
the ushze; non-toxic, hypo-allergenic, waterproof.
Oh, and I threw in some sprinkles to make it pop.
sprinkles?
glass microbeads.
that's what refracted the light.
you're pretty smart for a hottie.
Yeah, I like to mix things up.
it keeps things interesting.
but like I always say, at the end of the day, it's not about the paint.
it's about the painter.
right, well, you'd better hope like hell it's not about either.
thanks for coming in on your day off.
I came as soon as I heard.
what's the prognosis?
they're running a bunch of tests, trying to figure out how best to treat him.
whatever it is, he got a prolonged dose of it in very close contact.
he's been in and out ever since.
his condition will get worse if we don't figure this out fast.
radiation can eat through every organ in your body.
there's got to be something we can do.
there is.
let's get back to the lab and try to figure out what took Liza Carpenter's life before it takes his.
so this is the Exposure Control Facility.
complete chemical, biological and radiological shielding.
your taxpayer dollars at work.
speaking of, I took a core tissue sample from her liver at 600 REM.
that's acute radiation poisoning.
internal bleeding, rapid infection.
hundred percent mortality in ten to 14 days, tops.
Yeah, but get this.
her epidermal reading was almost twice that high.
Oh, my God.
that cuts the timeline in half.
this girl was a walking ghost.
that's what they call it.
by the time she knew something was wrong, it was already too late.
so we're looking at external exposure at levels high enough to induce dementia.
maybe that's what made her walk into traffic.
and why Sid got sick.
without a suit like this, that kind of exposure couldn't help but leave him contaminated.
Yeah, well, whatever it is, something Liza handled or touched was absorbed into her skin.
and has to be what killed her
here we go: tox results.
the radioactive agent was...
thallium-201.
no wonder you can't touch it.
thallium is deadly on its own, let alone as a radioactive isotope.
is there a way to treat it?
Yeah, one.
radiology.
Yes, this is Dr. Hawkes from the crime lab.
you need to treat Dr. Hammerback with nasogastric intubation of Prussian blue.
ten grams, stat. - Right away, Doctor.
hope we called this in time.
looks like our vic had active hyphae on her shoes.
aka mold. - Yeah.
you find anything like that on her clothing?
no.
mold usually needs exposure to water and a dark, contained environment to thrive.
she must have came in contact with it before she went to the concert.
could help us retrace her steps to find out exactly where she came in contact with the thallium.
see if you can narrow down the genus and species.
find out exactly what kind of mold this is. - You got it.
same kind of butterfly rashing?
hair loss?
Yeah, yeah, I'll be right there. - Kidding me, right?
found another body.
remember, nobody touches the body without a safety suit on.
who are we looking at?
our vic is Dante Gunther.
he's the director of Killer Vacation, and he was set to receive a lifetime achievement award at tonight's horror film festival.
what is he, 20-something?
a little early for lifetime achievement.
looks a little late to me. Anyone see what happened?
no, the audience is so far below us, they couldn't see or hear anything.
publicist I spoke to said that Gunther was supposed to intro the film, but he showed up late.
then he started acting weird. He didn't remember his own name.
he even started pulling out his own hair.
so they finally rolled the picture, brought him up here to this VIP section, and a few minutes after that, he hit the red carpet.
anyone make direct contact with him?
Negative-- no moviegoers were allowed up here, and he arrived at the screening alone.
tell you o thing, that's not the sound of applause we're hearing.
so far, the hotel room appears to be clean.
tell the detectives they're cleared to enter.
did the CDC tell us anything else?
our deceased director just checked into the hotel two days ago.
concierge say where he was before the screening?
they're checking restaurant and car reservations.
nothing yet.
the CDC's only found low levels of radiation thus far.
normal for living in the city. - That sounds localized.
we might have something here.
it's in his cuff.
this is the source of the radiation.
Hey, any word on Sid?
now that his specialists have a course of treatment, they're hopeful.
Oh, good.
so, you find anything on our new vic?
as a matter of fact...
I searched the vic's clothes for possible trace.
found this.
a torn piece of paper?
it's older stock, but I'm having it carbon-dated to be sure.
there's some kind of a sheen to it.
thallium is soluble.
could've been applied in liquid form.
call agent. Get festival dates, times.
forgot his Blackberry and needed a notepad?
Dante Gunther and Liza Carpenter have to be connected somehow.
they both died of radioactive thallium poisoning at around the same time.
other than that, I still do not see a connection.
what if they just randomly crossed paths?
few seconds at a public place, unaware of each other, not knowing that they came into contact with something contaminated?
if that's true, how many more people out there have no idea how sick they are?
so far, we've found no other radioactive trace at any place either of them were at in the days before their deaths.
means we need to keep looking.
ready for some Heavy Metal 101?
rock on.
thallium has a pretty toxic place in the periodic table, somewhere right between mercury and lead.
cozy but deadly.
Yeah, and apparently, 60% to 70% of it is used in the electronic and optical lens industry.
the rest of it is used in nuclear medicine.
isn't it also used in rat poisoning?
at one point, yes, but it was just way too toxic, so besides China, it's pretty much been banned everywhere else.
well, somebody got their hands on it, so we need to check every medical, optical and technical lab using thallium in New York City.
maybe one of them is missing our murder weapon.
so, the Mylar strip definitely tested positive for thallium.
Yeah, it's an EM Soft Tag.
it's most commonly used as an anti-theft device for printed material.
so maybe Dante Gunther was exposed to a radiated book.
but where?
the paper in his pocket might help us answer that.
now, it dates to the 1930s, and the Scanning Probe microscope indicated that it was freeze-dried.
some kind of preservation technique?
no, no. It's a process used to repair books after water damage.
Oh, that could be the link between our vics.
the mold I pulled from Liza Carpenter's sandal came back as Stakybotrus.
black toxic mold. - Right.
thrives on stagnant water, and is mostly found in water-damaged buildings.
the two vics might have been in the same building, and touched the same book.
but how do we find one valuable, antique volume in Manhattan that's been soaked in water?
much less thallium.
with a little reading on the subject.
the New York City Library.
the Antiquities Branch.
they keep a lot of high-end material here for limited public access.
the building itself looks pretty old.
they had some faulty plumbing.
wound up with a flood in their lower stacks last year.
so, you're thinking, this year they added thallium to their collection?
that's why we're here.
there's got to be over a million books in this place, Mac.
then we'd better start checking them out.
special COHECHONS
I got somethin
tibetan Book of the Dead.
and they say, reading's fundamental.
this time it was fatal.
the Knot of Eternity.
that was painted on Liza Carpenter's forehead.
that's a Tibetan symbol of omniscient wisdom.
a page has been ripped out.
paper's consistent with what Hawkes found on Dante Gunther.
might also explain the Mylar strip we found in the cuff of his pants.
I think we got our black mold.
the symbol, the page, the mold-- all those connect our vics to this book.
but anyone who handled the book could have been contaminated.
not a very precise way of targeting people.
unless the vics were poisoned at random.
what kind of killer doesn't want to know who his victims are?
prussian blue?
Yeah. It's his second dose.
it speeds up the removal of thallium from the body, but he's too sick to swallow it, so they had to insert a feeding tube.
is it working?
only time will tell.
conditions such as these in a public facility are indefensible and reprehensible.
that's why I'm filing a wrongful death lawsuit...
against the City of New York and the New York City Library, both complicit in the radiation deaths of my clients,
those are our two victims, Mac.
and Molly Paulson.
who's Molly Paulson?
she was my wife for 11 years.
I still can't believe she's gone.
when did she pass away?
two months ago.
why do you think she was poisoned by radiation?
she was a librarian at the New York City Library.
well, Mr. Paulson, the main branch of the library is expansive.
the odds of Molly coming in contact with one book in the Special...
collections section?
because that is where she worked, you know.
for the last five years.
may I ask, what were you told was her cause of death?
our family doctor said lupus is what killed her.
and all I can say is, the minute I saw the news and heard about the-the rash and the hair loss,
I knew it had to be thallium poisoning.
even if the symptoms are also consistent with lupus?
she was in remission a week before she died.
it all happened so fast, but now it all makes sense.
you know, Molly and I used to took an art class on the weekends together.
I painted that picture of her.
but if thallium did kill your wife, that means it was murder, and the only way I can confirm that is to have her body exhumed.
you do what you have to do, but mark my words
somebody's gonna pay.
Mr. Paulson, I'm sorry for your loss.
well, can I speak with him?
Oh, of course.
no, no, I understand.
well, thank you, Doctor. I'll call back later.
Sid? - Yeah.
he's still under heavy treatment, but according to the hospital, he seems to be alert and responsive.
well, that's good news. - You want some more?
Absolutely. - Great.
well, as it turns out, nobody's actually allowed to check out books from Special Collections at the library's central branch.
they're for reference viewing only.
so our killer contaminated the book from inside the library.
Yeah, and anybody who wanted to read it had to sign in.
Liza Carpenter signed in two weeks ago, and Dante Gunther, about a week after that.
so I figured we got to be looking for somebody who signed in before those two.
Yeah, and if that somebody's still alive, they could be our suspect.
in the past six months, only ten people signed in.
eight of them are clean.
one of them-- a guy named Timothy Pram-- actually read the book twice.
should I just get to the best part?
he has priors?
for multiple acts of vandalism at Manhattan chemical laboratories, and an attempted break-in at, get this-- Three Mile Island.
Oh, this could be his twisted way of making a statement.
where is he now?
currently residing at 7th and Webster.
that's the same address that was scribbled on the book page that Dante Gunther tore out.
I knew that rung a bell.
excuse me.
NYPD.
I am Lhamo Vadhana.
do you have any idea where we can find Timothy Pram?
he no longer exists.
what do you mean, he's dead?
in a manner of speaking.
he is who I used to be.
okay, then.
listen, Lame-o...
it's Lhamo.
Tim, why don't we start over?
when did you start hiding behind Buddha?
Oh, my transition occurred when I stopped hiding.
great. Then you won't mind telling us what you know about these two people.
I'm not familiar with these individuals. - No?
cause we're familiar with your tendency to go nuclear.
and since these poor folks died of radiation poisoning, and one of them had your address in his pocket...
what are their names?
Liza Carpenter and Dante Gunther.
I don't know the woman, but Mr. Gunther did call me recently regarding several tenets of Buddhism, specifically, its sacred view of what to do when death is closing in.
I believe he said he was developing a film along those lines.
so what, you told him to read the book first?
I suggested that before we meet, he should become more familiar with the Bardo Thodol.
the Book of the Dead?
as Westerners refer to it, yes.
it's a centuries-old text to prepare one for the signs and rituals of death and rebirth.
are you aware that book was contaminated with a deadly dose of thallium?
of course he is.
he's the one who contaminated it.
detectives, I fully acknowledge and accept the mistakes of my youth.
vandalizing a nuclear facility was a foolish thing to do.
but I have paid for my transgressions, and my past is just that-- my past.
I have no intention of hastening anyone's journey from this life to the next.
Really?
cause I have every intention of hastening you from here to lockup.
hold on, Flack, before you book him...
mind if I check your aura?
what's that stuff?
it's a small bit of trace I found on The Book of the Dead.
came back as a poriferan.
sea sponge?
this particular species hails from the reefs off Southern Florida.
what's really interesting-- I found trace on the trace.
check it out. See the red?
that's it magnified 100 times.
I found it inside the sea sponge.
morphology suggests that it's some type of protein, maybe chitin?
some kind of an exoskeleton.
Yeah, but the thickness of the sample indicates it's not from a crustacean.
looks like an insect.
so what the heck is a bug doing on a sea sponge?
we're looking at a virtual image scan of Molly Paulson's exhumed body.
fortunately, she had a green burial, so there was almost no contact with the body by the mortuary after she died two months ago.
but when the CDC dug her up, and the Geiger needles pinned, looking at her this way seemed like the safest bet.
so we know her husband was right.
it wasn't lupus that killed her.
tox has already confirmed that Molly's tissue bore high traces of thallium-201, just like the other two victims.
then why don't we see it?
maybe we're not looking in the right place.
enlarge the stomach.
see all those lesions in the lining?
from cardia to corpus to pylorus.
the entire organ is ulcerated.
she have any gastric problems in her medical history?
not according to the records.
then you're thinking her exposure to radiation wasn't transdermal.
that's right.
Molly Paulson ingested her poison.
doesn't make sense.
we have three victims of thallium poisoning.
two were exposed transdermally, and one by ingestion.
you know what? But the two victims who touched the book-- they came later.
our first vic, Molly Paulson, somehow swallowed her thallium.
the delivery system is more direct, more personal.
feels like she was an intended target.
right. Meaning the other two were just collateral damage.
Yeah. So I'm thinking somebody specifically wanted her dead.
we've already cleared the graffiti artist and the Buddhist monk.
well, there's someone else you might want to talk to.
he was Molly Paulson's assistant at the library.
but according to the personnel department
she had him formally written up three times for not showing up to work.
then she died-- and he's been a no-show ever since.
do we know where he is?
his address on his application turned out to be a fake.
I got our guys running down a real one as we speak.
in the meantime, I figured you might want to rummage through his desk.
all right.
Ah, here we go again.
come on, I don't want to put on that suit.
no. Levels are low enough for lead-lined gloves.
Oh, good.
you don't mind if I keep my distance?
I'd actually prefer if you did.
smoke detectors.
these connectors were cut away from brackets on the wall to remove the smoke detectors.
Why?
most ionization models use small radioactive source to detect the smoke particles.
by the looks of it, this guy had quite the collection.
whatever happened to friendly hobbies, like collecting baseball cards?
getting a hit off something in this box.
iodine.
in tablet form, these can be used to protect your thyroid from absorbing certain types of radiation.
half of Eastern Europe took them after Chernobyl.
well, it looks like Lawrence Wagner was taking them as well.
want to find out why?
according to his mother, he spends all his time back here doing experiments in the shed.
when the hell are people gonna learn how to profile?
lawrence Wagner, NYPD!
listen up, Larry. I'm a little pissed off over having to wear this outfit.
so if you don't open this door, I'm gonna huff and puff and nuke your little house down.
please tell me that's not a reactor.
all right, Lawrence.
Lawrence, put your hands up above your head.
walk out slowly.
right there, right there.
can I borrow one of your suits?
I told you.
I was building a reactor.
Why?
we need cheaper energy alternatives!
that's why I spent the last two years gathering all the necessary elements just to make do-it-yourself nuclear fission a reality.
was it easy? No.
have a taken a few risks, made a few sacrifices? You're damn right I had.
but every experiment has brought me closer to success.
and I knew if I just keptorking on it, I, I, I, I could save people all sorts of money.
you turned your backyard into a radioactive waste dump.
I mean, I'm not sure that you saved people a lot.
you didn't save your boss.
who, Molly? Sh-Sh-She never went to my lab.
you mean your shed. - Whatever.
she wasn't interested in my work.
well, that must've made you really mad.
mad enough to kill her?
I didn't kill anyone!
Yeah, she wrote me up a couple of times. Yeah, I was pissed off.
but I only took that job so I could score some more smoke detectors.
I'm a scientist...
no, you're a backyard quack who's lucky to be alive and you're about to be charged with triple homicide.
yeah?
I hate to say it, Mac-- but I think we've got the wrong guy.
the evidence we recovered from Lawrence Wagner's wannabe lab just doesn't support it.
Yeah. CDC found thorium-232 found in the gas lantern mantles;
radium, uh, from the antique clocks;
beryllium from a mail order catalog; and americium found in, uh, all those stolen smoke detectors.
but nowhere-- have we found even the slightest trace of thallium.
we can still get him, right?
for EPA violations, felony larceny, maybe, but not for murder.
all right, I don't know if this helps, but I did at least find a use for the crushed insect trace that we found in The Book of the Dead.
GCMS picked up traces of carminic acid or carmine.
it's normally found on the bodies and the eggs of the beetle Dactylopius coccus.
now, this beetle is often crushed to make pigment for paint, specifically, red.
some artists use sponges for painting.
maybe that's how the two traces fit together.
Ka-Blam the Shriiimper?
he does all his work with an airbrush.
no. There's another artist we're forgetting.
you killed Molly.
and then you murdered two more innocent victims.
don't-don't be ridiculous.
we read your trial records, Joel.
so now we know about the chemical plant in Chinatown you represented three years ago.
closed down for illegal importation of various radioactive agents, including thallium.
that's where you got it.
and since Molly already had lupus, you saw the perfect opportunity to use it.
you fed it to her, and you made an already sick woman die a cruel and painful death.
you have no idea how miserable she was.
because she's dead.
I took care of my wife for a long time!
Yeah, and after she died, you took care of her insurance money, too.
half a million-dollar policy.
not too shabby for an ambulance chaser.
that still wasn't enough, was it, Joel?
no, no. You wanted a lawsuit. That's where the real money is.
only you needed a few more victims to make it all look legit.
so you used your wife's access to the library and painted the book.
murdered two people.
nearly killed one of my colleagues and risked the lives of God knows how many other people.
so I wouldn't have to practice law anymore.
day after day, I spent defending that chemical plant.
night after night, worried about my wife.
how she wasn't happy or healthy anymore.
so you were angry at life-- decided to embrace death instead.
is that why you chose the Book of the Dead?
it was in Special Collections.
I knew people would read it.
figured I'd take care of business, file one last suit, and then retire from everything.
that will depend on your execution date.
get up.
you were right, Mr. Paulson.
someone is gonna pay.
Hiya, Sid.
Sheldon. How nice of you to come.
how you doing?
let's just say I know how a microwave burrito feels.
but I should also say thank you.
I owe a great deal of my recovery to you.
Ah, come on, that was nothing. You would have done the same for me.
as a matter of fact, I would.
if you get tired of that Journal, I thought you might enjoy a little light reading.
yeah?
a clean copy, I presume?
we were worried about you, Sid. It's good to see you up and around.
up, maybe. Around might take a few days.
okay, who's up for the Ranger game?
did you bring any beer?
I wish I did.
how about we pour you some water instead?
all right. Chips and water. That's like pizza and milk.
you're, you're kidding about the beer, right?
Nope.
ladies and gentlemen, the captain has turned on the seat belt sign.
please return to your seats with your seat belts fastened until the captain turns off the light and it is safe to move about the cabin.
I don't want to die this way.
how can you be so calm?
the wings are gonna rip right off this tin can.
it's all right.
there's no correlation between air turbulence and structural failure unless, of course, we're flying inside a thunderstorm.
we're just crossing a barrier between different air currents.
what are you, a rocket scientist?
crime scene investigator.
just try not to think about the turbulence.
what do you do for a living, Mr...
Riley-- Ed Riley. Inventor.
I'm filing a patent in DC today.
Wow.
run, swim, sleep, skydive, crash in an airplane...
no way this is coming off.
I call it the "The Wig Lock."
25% percent of all young men in their 20s suffer from it.
started losing my hair when I was 28.
now, I know what you're thinking this guy's too young to be follicly challenged.
premature male baldness runs in my family.
actually, it's on my mother's side.
all four of her brothers bald before they reached 40.
I didn't catch your name.
uh, Mac Taylor.
excuse me one minute.
I'm sorry, sir,
I'll have to ask you to return to your seat.
detective Taylor, New York Crime Lab.
is there a problem?
who found him? -I did.
during the turbulence,
I saw blood coming from under the door.
severed carotid artery.
he was stabbed.
did you find or see anything that could have caused this?
nothing.
what about anyone leaving or entering the bathroom before the body was discovered?
no.
federal Air Marshal.
his gun is gone.
you think his killer's gonna take over the plane?
he disarmed the only person who could stop him.
keep the seat belt sign on and notify the pilots to stay locked inside the cockpit and get us turned around back to JFK.
do you think there's more than one hijacker?
I don't know.
if we turn around, people are gonna start asking questions.
tell the passengers someone is sick.
I'm gonna need a first aid kit and the passenger manifest.
the rest of you, back to work.
business as usual.
if anyone needs to use the bathroom, have them use the one up front.
I want no one back here.
remember, someone on this plane is a killer.
ladies and gentlemen, we have an emergency.
a passenger is ill, and we have been instructed to return to New York.
please take your seats and remain seated for the duration of our flight.
we apologize for this inconvenience.
did you hear that A passenger's sick.
Yeah, right, what they really mean is an engine is about to fail.
this is about a passenger.
he's dead.
what?
I'm gonna need your help.
you've got to stay calm.
there's been a murder on board.
whoever did it has a gun.
you're not joking, are you?
you're gonna follow me to the back of the plane.
I want you to stand in the galley, keep your eyes on the cabin and look for anything suspicious.
like what?
you'll know it when you see it.
why me?
you're the only one I'm sure is not the killer.
you were next to me the entire flight.
Oh, boy.
that guy's dead, all right.
nice hair, though.
you're my eyes.
keep them on the cabin;
you see something you don't like, let me know.
first aid kit and passenger manifest, Detective.
no wallet or ID.
nothing with a picture.
maybe he left his wallet in his seat.
what seat was he in?
I think it was... 6C.
no one listed on the manifest for that row.
well, air marshals aren't always assigned seats.
but it was definitely row six.
I remember giving him a magazi right after we took off.
I'll check his seat.
and while I do that, have the captain contact the Federa Air Marshal Service.
give them that badge number.
let's see what they can tell us about this guy.
according to the manifest, seat 11D is supposed to be occupied by James Turner.
there was a gentleman sitting there.
beverage service hadn't started, but he seemed very agitated, so I gave him some water.
I don't know where he went.
there he is.
row 12.
you find anything?
nothing.
no wallet, no carry-on.
we have a problem.
according to the Federal Air Marshal Service, this badge number is registered to a guy named Roger Stockwell.
late 40s, short, cropped salt-and-pepper hair, and scheduled to be on a flight to Los Angeles today.
not the description of our vic.
then, who's this guy?
I can send a picture of his prints back to my lab, but, uh... I'm gonna need cell phone service.
the captain has a satellite phone in the cockpit.
I believe it has a camera.
get it.
I also need a tube of lipstick and three air sickness bags.
I'll collect the barf bags.
I got it.
here's the pilot's satellite phone.
hold that.
impressive.
Hey.
just warming up, Walsh.
you're a show-off, Bonasera.
Nope.
what I am...
...is good.
and you and the rest of your firemen buddies aren't gonna know what hit you at the playoffs 'cause NYPD is gonna take it this year.
Hey, I told them a coed baseball was a bad idea.
I thought you were supposed to be on your way to Washington to testify.
I was, but a male DB changed my flight plans.
what?
Yeah, the vic appears to have been posing as an air marshal.
he's got a badge that's legit, but no ID and an empty holster.
Where's the gun?
wish I could answer that.
you hearing anything about any other hijackings? -Stella?
no, no, nothing.
mac, if this was organized, we'd have heard something.
unless we're the first.
I sent a set of the vic's prints to the lab.
have Lindsay find out who he is.
and Stella, hunt down everything you can on a James Turner.
he a suspect?
I don't know yet.
but in the next half hour, I just might find out.
that's when we land.
so, get everyone over to JFK, secure a hangar, and tell them I'm coming in with a crime scene.
this is a positive ID, Lindsay?
your victim's name is Anton Greenway.
he's your fake air marshal.
get this. He escaped from custody yesterday.
he was a three-striker headed to Sing Sing for a life stretch, and he jumped out of a second floor courtroom window.
convicted of?
smuggling, dealing.
he used to work at JFK as an employee for Atlantic Vista Airways, so he knew his way around airplanes and airports.
what about the owner of the badge?
you been able to locate Roger Stockwell yet?
the director for the air marshals said Stockwl was staying at an airport hotel last night, but he never checked in with the field office this morning.
Danny and Flack are on their way to the real air marshal's hotel.
Roger Stockwell, NYPD.
Mr. Stockwell, we need to talk to you, sir.
open it.
there's our air marshal.
looks like he checked out early.
this guy's been beat up pretty good.
bruising on his face, defensive bruises on his arm.
no sign of forced entry, but it does looks like he put up one hell of a fight.
since when do, uh, housekeepers use duct tape?
I'm guessing since they started packing Desert Eagle. 50s.
that cannon packs quite a punch.
Yeah.
only there were no reports of gunshots from hotel guests or employees.
right.
so, how does a highly trained and armed air marshal take one between the eyes, and nobody hears anything?
got something in his head wound.
you mean, besides the large caliber bullet?
white fibers.
looks like there's some more of it over there.
boom.
what have we got here?
can I get a witness?
well, hello there.
bullet hole and powder burns in the fur.
this might be why nobody heard anything.
an improvised silencer.
there's some more, uh, trace here, too.
killer's? -Nah.
the variegated color and the coarseness suggest that it's not human.
and it doesn't appear to be from the panda.
maybe the bear has a friend.
this also could be how the killer got in the room.
delivery.
you got the wrong room.
says, 102. Roger Stockwell?
happy birthday.
ladies and gentlemen, please remain calm
we'll be deplaning momentarily.
please remain seated and stay calm.
ladies and gentlemen, can I have your attention, please?
my name is Mac Taylor.
I'm a detective with the New York Crime Lab.
a murd was committed on this plane shortly after take off.
we'll need your full cooperation with our investigation.
when you deplane, please follow the instructions of the officers and the agents.
we're going to start with you, sir.
what's going on?
out of your seat slowly, please.
I didn't do anything. -Slowly. Come on.
just follow me. -I... I...
go with this officer.
get the rest of them off one by one, starting with the front row.
homeland Security and FAA believe that this murder was an isolated incident.
they're willing to let you take the lead so long as they're kept in the loop.
good.
I want each passenger searched Collect DNA and prints.
the only one I know didn't do it was the guy in the seat next to me.
mac, we can't do any of that without a warrant, and in order to get a warrant, we need probable cause.
the cause is murder, and one of them is our killer.
I know. I argued that point.
basically, all we can do is search the passengers' carry-on luggage and ask for their cooperation.
if they refuse...
we have to let them go.
right, and we can't detain them for more than 24 hours.
so unless we find evidence to hold a suspect before then, they all walk.
now,
homeland Security's going to question the passengers.
we're gonna check for evidence.
excuse me.
Hawkes, there's a body on the plane.
and the clock's ticking. I'm on it.
Adam, I want you to search the waste receptacles.
food service, walkways, lavatories.
any place the killer could have hidden the murder weapon and the air marshal's gun.
done.
Flack ran your suspect, James Turner.
he paid cash for a one-way ticket.
didn't check luggage, and didn't book a hotel room in Washington, DC, and doesn't live there.
so, why was he on the plane?
it's none of your business how I travel.
actually, it is.
you were on a flight where a murder was committed, and there's blood on your shirt, Mr. Turner.
doesn't look like you shaved today.
I don't know how that got there.
wait. Am I a suspect?
would you mind stepping over that tent and removing your clothes, please?
Yeah. Yeah, I do mind.
okay.
we'll do this the hard way.
we're gonna make a lot of phone calls to a lot of people, and somebody's gonna tell me something you don't want me to hear.
look,
I got a family in DC.
a second family.
first wife doesn't know.
it's, uh... It's complicated, but I'm not a d guy, I swear.
wrong answer, Mr. Turner.
what you should be explaining is how that blood got on your shirt, and swearing you didn't kill the guy on that plane.
I'm going to ask you one more time.
remove your clothing.
officer, escort him.
so, what do you think?
we'll know soon enough.
vic bled out.
a single stab wound to the neck.
spatter indicates he was most likely standing with his back to the wall.
he then spun around, leaving arterial spray before he collapsed.
I've got blood on the faucet.
looks like our killer came in here to clean up.
he could've left a latent blood trail on his way down the aisle.
might tell us where he sat.
I'll get the lights.
lot of trace.
take a hotel room, stick a couple of hundred people in there a day, forget about maid service.
we got every type of stain imaginable.
no blood.
blood trail goes cold in the second bathroom.
you know what they say.
one man's trash is another man's evidence pile.
what did you find?
air marshal's sig.
bottom of the lav trash across from the crime scene.
why remove the gun from the holster and not use it?
maybe our killer didn't get the chance.
you know, he found out the airplane was turning around, he got spooked and ditched the gun.
no one went into the bathroom after the body was discovered.
the gun had to have been dumd before or right after the murder.
anything that could have been used for a murder weapon?
nothing yet, unless you know how to kill a man with this.
what about the waste tank? Weapon could have been flushed.
uh, you... uh, you want me to process the toilets?
you asked for more field work, Adam.
get to it.
yeah... Oh.
I hate poop.
okay, our fugitive, Greenway, needs to get out of the city, so he poses as an air marshal, boards a plane using Stockwell's gun and badge.
another passenger kills him, doesn't take the gun, and instead tosses it in the trash.
which doesn't make any sense.
I mean, the only reason to kill an air marshal and take his gun is to hijack the plane.
and that didn't happen.
maybe our killer knew the air marshal wasn't the air marshal.
well, that would mean that it's about something else.
or...
maybe this can help us answer that.
Oh, tell me you found the murder weapon.
life vest?
try about 250 thousand Canadian. Five bales.
and the air marshal's missing ID and credential.
blood.
the blood on this pouch matches our vic, it means the killer touched it after committing murder.
he takes the money and ID and hides them.
I get the money, but why hide the ID?
to throw us off and delay ID'ing the vic.
if all we had was the badge and missing gun, then we'd be thinking it was a hijacking, instead of what it really might be.
a robbery gone bad at 30, 000 feet.
your real air marshal, Roger Stockwell, was dead before he hit the hotel room floor.
shot in the head with the 50 caliber recovered at the crime sence.
defensive bruising?
Mr. Greenway, yourirplane vic, can take credit for that.
I was able to match his fist to the subdermal bruising on Stockwell's jaw.
so that confirms that Stockwell and Greenway got in a fight.
so, Greenway's bruising came from the hotel and not from the struggle in the airplane laboratory with his killer
exactly.
and one mystery still remains.
care to take a stab at our murder weapon of choice?
well, definitely wasn't a fine-edged instrument.
the tissue looks torn and not cut.
very good.
well, here's a clue.
there are two unique marks on the mandible here.
that's a tough one.
what's the murder weapon?
I don't know.
never seen anything like this.
I'm leaving this one for you.
so, I'm gonna need his jawbone to make a mold.
see if I can match a possible murder weapon out of those marks.
I also found traces of condom lubricant and spermicide on his hand.
your vic may have joined the Mile-High Club before ending up in my not-so-exclusive one.
of course he could have had sex just prior to boarding.
but that's not very exciting.
any DNA, Sid?
no, and without that condom,
I can't tell you much more than that.
well, except for what's on his left hand there.
what's this? Writing?
Yes, uh,
I found it when I washedthe body.
alright, I'll run it through a language database.
see if I get any hits.
must be some kind of indelible ink.
whatever it is, he didn't want to forget it.
airline's sending in the suits.
they won't let any of the crew members give us a reference sample until they each talk to a lawyer.
already eliminated Ed.
I can eliminate the captain and the copilot.
they never left the cockpit before the murder.
homeland Security's talking to all the women passengers again.
but let me ask you this.
if one of them had sex with our vic, why kill him afterwards?
southern black widow spider is known for eating the male after mating.
well, at least they go out with a smile on their face.
the only problem with the Mile-High Club theory is that the vic could have had sex before he got on the plane.
there's no evidence that proves it happened in the lavatory.
my money's on Turner.
don't trust a guy who's got two families.
don't make that bet.
DNA results.
blood on his shirt didn't match the vic.
turned out to be his own.
okay.
so who else do we like for this?
without evidence? All of them.
prints on the duct tape from the air marshal's hotel room were a match to our shooter slash-fake air marshal Anton Greenway.
now, I think his plan was to just tie up Stockwell and steal his credentials.
but he brought a gun.
show of force.
I mean, look at the evidence:
there's the tape; the fact that there was a struggl position of the body away from the door.
so Stockwell fought back.
greenway felt had no choice but to use the gun.
right. How about you?
I have run these letters through every language database.
it's not a word. It's not a phone number.
see, if I zoom in, you can sethat the "I"s-- they're not actually "I"s.
they're each the number 1.
it's a code.
you know what?
maybe they're GPS coordinates.
exactly. Seven digits.
degrees and decimal minutes.
okay, here we go.
St. Andrews Air Field. Montreal.
looks abandoned.
fake ID. Gun. Canadian money.
our vic wasn't smuggling.
he was gonna hijack that plane and escape to Canada.
but if he wanted to get to Canada, why not just take a direct flight?
well, being a US air marshal doesn't mean you're excluded from having to pass through Canadian customs.
he had no choice but to hijack a plane.
but somebody killed him before he could do it.
who kills a hijacker and then returns back to their seat ????
this was the suit jacket our victim Anton Greenway was wearing on the airplane.
Yeah. And it looks like a regular jacket just off the rack, right?
right. -Wrong.
custom job. Take a look.
found these in Layout.
hidden pockets hand-stitched into the liner.
greenway was a drug smuggler.
Yeah, but I think this time he was carrying something else.
the 250K fits perfectly into the pockets.
that's got to be how he got the cash on the plane.
and the stolen air marshal badge was his guaranteed ticket through security without it being discovered.
but the killer moved the cash after the murder.
so either he knew Greenway had the money on him or he found it by accident.
Yeah, and he knew he couldn't take it off the plane when it landed because weight find it on him and connect him to the murder.
well, it works. Only who are we talking about here?
I've got 40 suspects left and only theories.
well, I did discover traces of cocaine and nonhuman hair on the jacket.
now, the hair's a match to the one Danny found in the hotel room.
can't tell you where it came from, but I can tell you that it's leopard.
leopard?
greenway was in controlled custody up until yesterday.
I doubt he made a stop at the zoo between his escape and committing murder.
I think Greenway had a partner.
this was a two-man show?
it's looking that way.
I just finished processing the Desert Eagle that was used to kill the air marshal at the hotel.
serial number is long gone.
Acid-washed.
rest of the gun wiped clean. Almost.
shooter forgot to wipe down the magazine.
ran the palm print through AFIS and I got a hit.
manages club downtown. Okay?
but before he went legit, he made a name for himself in the import-export business until the DEA forced him to retire.
okay? He did five years in Rikers.
prior to the arrest, he worked baggage at Atlantic Vista Airways.
same job Greenway had.
Yeah, and they worked there at the same time.
Terrence Davis his name's not on the flight manifest.
if they're partners, how come they weren't on the same plane?
I think we should ask him.
either allergic to half-naked women or there's a cat in here.
there's a cat in here.
there's our boy Terrence Davis.
big housecat.
you could say she put this club on the map.
not really into cats myself.
I mean yes you're more K-9?
smarter than you look.
what can I do for you, McGruff?
cause I'm seriously not in the mood.
may the mood's better in your office.
I'm not asking.
okay, guys, what's this about?
what's this about? It's about your partner.
we know that you two moved into and blow out of baggage claim at JFK while you worked for Atlantic Vista Airways.
long time ago, man.
aren't you up on current events?
you know what? You're right.
that's why we came to talk to you.
why don't you tell us who killed Anton Greenway.
Anton's dead?
don't play like this is new news.
I don't have game like that no more, man.
that dope fiend is dead, it's nothing to do with me.
besides, he was crazier than a blind gunfighter.
not surprise he met his demise.
maybe you're not so surprised because you had something to do with it.
Anton was killed on a plane that boarded using stolen air marshal credentials.
an air marshal who was murdered with a Desert Eagle that had your prints all over it.
you see where I'm going with this, T?
when was the last time you saw your buddy Anton?
yesterday.
first time I seen him in years.
tell us about the reunion.
look, man, the game through 'cause I was holding some lettuce for him till he got out the joint. That's it.
what about the jacket he was wearing?
the one with the all the pockets sewn into it for smuggling dope.
retired years ago, Anton came by.
he wanted it. I said cool, as long as I don't know nothing to do with nothing.
you know what I mean?
let's get back to the. 50 then with your prints on it.
I don't know what you're talking about.
listen to me, T.
I got a solid murder charge that I can hang around your neck.
wrong guy. I didn't pull no trigge
your prints are the only ones on the weapon.
I don't care what you got.
I didn't kill no one. Truth.
not bad.
but I'd pull out some tears for the jury because that performance won't keep you out of jail.
let's go.
I'm taking you out the front door.
all right, cool, man.
look, you want to arrest me for gun possession, cool.
but you know what?
matter of fact, I'll give you the gun.
let me see those hands Now! Hands!
do it, now!
scum.
I'd tried to help this fool and this is what he does.
no good deed goes unpunished.
you're also going to take a hit for a parole violation for owning that gun.
assume the position.
Terrence Davis is sticking to his story.
we're still holding him on a gun charge, but he's got a solid alibi for the time that Roger Stockwell, the air marshal, was killed.
what have you got?
well, this is everything from the airplane that could've conceivably been used as a murder weapon.
I ran it all for blood and DNA.
no hits.
doesn't surprise me.
we know that our killer washed up.
he probably cleaned the weapon too.
right. So the only way for us to ID the weapon to figure out what made these distinctive marks in the vic's jaw.
okay. So we're looking for a two-pronged weapon.
let's see what kind of damage these guys can do.
how do people get on board with this stuff?
I had my toothpaste confiscated.
it's not our weapon.
all right.
we need to find something that would penetrate deeper.
we're running out possibilities.
Oh, good. I was looking for you guys.
Oh, my God, Adam. What is that smell?
Oh, it's garbage and a little, uh...
...eau de toilet.
literally.
I hope it was worth it.
big time. I think I got something.
the condom that I found, in the lavatory waste...
you got DNA. -No way.
the vic's love glove was found floating in a toxic waste dump.
but the wrapper survived the stew, and so did the the lipstick on the wrapper.
it took a little time, but I was able to narrow it down the shade and the manufacturer.
fantastic.
great work, Adam. -Yeah, uh, I...
I should shower. Ugh!
Yeah, yeah. You do that.
well, I think what we have here is a failure to communicate, Terrence.
I'm talking, but you ain't listening.
I'm just not feeling, Flack.
well, maybe you'll feel this.
remember that defaced firearm with your prints all over the magazine, the one Anton swiped from the club?
it was used to kill a federal agent.
now if I let this go federal, you're gonna do at least ten years up there.
however, if keep it local, you probably won't do any real jail time.
Local..." that means strings attached, right?
you manage the hottest club in the city.
you say you're out of the life, but I'm sure you keep your ear to the rail.
I hear things.
I want to hear what you hear.
how does it work?
you'll be chged with a felony, take a plea...
...and work off your time as a confidential informant.
now, this is a very limited-time offer, Terrence.
limited, in like right now.
I got a DA waiting to hear from me.
I need a decision.
the minute I met you, I knew we'd be friends.
excellent.
Clockran out.
I need more time.
I got nothing to hold them on.
it's out of our hands.
one of these people committed murder yesterday and we're letting them go.
homeland Security doesn't like it anymore than we do, but none of us have a choice here.
I want my clothes back.
they'll be released from the crime lab when the investigation's over.
you're going to hear from my attorney.
get on the bus.
where you going?
I'm not in the business of letting killers go.
detective Taylor.
I've got Detective Bonasera on the line for you.
what have you got, Stella?
a lipstick stain.
we might be able to match it to one of our fele suspects.
now, I ran it by the lipstick that you took off of Nina the flight attendant.
no match.
everyone else is in play, and warrants are on their way.
they're gone.
they're all gone.
good, thanks.
the bus just droed everybody off.
now I got guys out there ready toound up all the female passengers and crew members and bring them back, but it's going to taka couple hours.
she could be long gone by then.
what do you got, Doc?
good news.
I put the XRF to Greenway's jawbone, and I found traces of brass and nickel plating in the marks made by our murder weapon.
I did a little research, and found that nickel plating is commonly used in trophies, badges, jewelry.
but there was nothing confiscated from the plane that matches our murder weapon.
what are you thinking, Mac?
and wings.
flight attendant's wings.
they are made from metal, and the edges would be more than sharp enough to puncture the skin.
Hawkes, send me a picture of that jawbone.
it's on its way.
the points of the wing are a match to the marks in the vic's jaw.
looks like you found the murder weapon.
and our murderer.
look at the flight attendants.
we took their phot as they came off the plane, and Susan is the only one not wearing her wings.
Oops.
I just got off the phone with the airline, Mac.
the airline rep said she used her privileges to hop a flight to Paris, that leaves out of Gate 50 in three minutes.
she's running.
last call for Atlantic Vista Airways Flight 1256 departing for Paris.
all passengers should be on board at this time.
you can't go down there. It's against FAA...
let's go.
my lab found Anton Greenway's blood in the crevices.
he was going to hijack the plane.
I should be commended for protecting the passengers.
only you didn't come forward to take credit.
I was scared.
there could've been another hijacker on the plane.
there wasn't, and you knew that. because you knew Anton.
you both worked at Atlantic Vista Airways at the same time, while he was smuggling drugs.
if he worked at that airline, it was a coincidence.
yesterday, you converted a quarter-million US dollars into Canadian money.
the exact amount Anton smuggled on board inside the jacket heas wearing.
I have a warrant on the way.
I'm going to match your lipstick to the condom wrapper we found.
we can continue to dance here, Susan, but the song's over.
I loved him, you know?
and you were helping him escape...
only something went wrong.
one minute you're his lover...
the next, his killer.
what did he do?
he murdered that air marshal.
he was only supposed to tie him up and rob him.
that's what we agreed to.
what other plans did he change?
everything.
he put a gun up to my neck and told me he didn't want to go to DC.
he wanted the plane to fly to Canada.
I agreed to help him get out of New York.
I didn't agree to take over an airplane filled with innocent people.
listen to me.
I've got to get out of the country.
no. I told you we can take another plane when we land.
forget it!
just get me to the cockpit and I'll do the rest.
are you crazy? Forget it. This isn't what we talked about.
Susan, I can't get into the cockpit without your help.
do it or you die.
come forward, having prevented a hijacking, or go for the cash.
you made the wrong choice, Susan...
...and now you're grounded.
ow, my leg!
we're seconds away. I can see the scene from here.
you sure about the vic's identity?
Yep, triple-checked it.
two vics within a week and a half with that same name can't be a coincidence.
any idea where our Mac is?
we've got another victim. Second one this week.
identified as Mac Taylor.
are you all right?
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.
what is it?
I'm his next target still.
how do you know that, Mac?
because he was just here.
I didn't see a face just black shoes.
something about it struck me as odd.
he definitely went through my wallet, but nothing was missing.
why would he take the risk?
????? I'm here every morning alone for at least an hour.
when those two came in, he took off.
did they see anything?
no, just someone walking away.
if this guy's plan was to kill you, we can assume he'll try again.
so far, the only thing you have in common with our two prior vics is your name.
well, if that's how the killer's choosing his targets, we need to get to any other Mac Taylors before he does.
according to his driver's license "MacAbee James Taylor,"
but his business cards, building directory and organ donor signature all read "Mac Taylor, CPA.."
clenched hand. Cadaveric spasm?
Yeah, he definitely tried to hold on to something.
and there's bruising on his face, which suggests some kind of struggle.
this doesn't make any sense.
what?
the keys could not have bounced this far.
I don't understand how there can be two points of impact.
see these pieces of plastic?
they're from the vic's keychain.
obviously, it broke when he fell to the floor.
but I found some here.
and then some here near the body.
what kind of distance are we looking at?
15 feet?
right, well, that's my point.
they don't look like they were kicked or scattered.
I didn't find any in between the two points of impact; it's like the keys fell twice.
the obvious question is how does a keychain land here and end up over there?
obvious answer.
the killer picked them up and moved them.
Yeah, but why?
wait a minute.
that's got to be what the vic was holding on to.
his attacker grabbed the keychain, took what he was after, and left the rest behind.
MacArthur Taylor. Mac Taylor victim #1.
investment banker, activist, chairman of the Art Center Restoration Foundation.
he's been here over a week.
no one's come to claim the body.
we can't seem to find any family members.
unsolved murder,
cod exsaguination from a gunshot wound.
good memory.
and GSR I collected from around the injury is a match to traces of GSR Hawkes found on the face of this morning's victim,
mac Taylor #2.
but, Sid, our victim from this morning wasn't shot.
and no gun was recovered from the scene.
but there's evidence his attacker had a weapon.
crime scene photos Hawkes took of the victim's face show subdermal bruising in the shape of the frame of a small automatic.
so he carried a gun and never shot it?
and if he had, he wouldn't have missed.
notice the "V" in the break.
it indicates the origination point of the fracture.
this injury was premortem, just prior to death.
and mobility would have been significantly impaired.
the victim could barely walk.
the killer could have taken aim and...
end of story.
so he shoots our first victim, MacArthur Taylor, point-blank right in the chest.
the second, he pistol-whips, and instead of shooting him, tosses him over the railing?
leaves me to conclude that the gun jammed.
or what if he never intend on killing him at all?
detective Taylor?
deputy Inspector Gillian Whitford.
it's nice to finally meet you.
welcome to the division.
Thanks.
it'd be great if we could grab a coffee.
I'll check my schedule and give you a call.
there's no need to do that.
I'm free now.
thank you.
inspector, we're both very busy, so simply put, if you tracked me down to ask that I remove myself from the Mac Taylor murder investigation,
I'm afraid you're going to endure this mediocre cup of coffee for nothing.
I see you're not the type to concern himself with first impressions.
I'm sorry for being too direct.
I just don't want to waste your time.
detective, if there's one thing I've learned throughout my career as a law enforcement officer, it's that you should always do your homework.
that said, your reputation precedes you.
I believe the words "stubborn"
and "strong-willed" were mentioned more than once.
you know the risks.
I just want you to use your best judgement.
I took the liberty of reviewing some of your high-profile cases.
you've put away quite a few dangerous offenders.
I can't imagine any of them were happy about it.
suggesting revenge for something I've done as our killer's motive?
I want you to consider it as a possibility.
I don't believe you're the target.
it's just that this case fits the classic profile of retaliation.
which means if this guy wants my attention, he's not done yet.
you're thinking our second vic was an accident?
our killer came to the crime scene with a gun.
he's used it before. Why didn't he use it here?
now, Sid suggested that the gun might've jammed, but we don't have any proof of that.
I processed the stairwell and I found our vic's prints on the handle of every door from floor 99 to 95, so clearly, they were locked and he was trying to get in.
then on the 91st floor, the door was unlocked, and I found drag and scuff marks.
he wasn't walking.
more than likely he tripped, fell down the stairs.
that's when he broke his ankle.
at which point the killer had ample opportunity to aim and fire.
guys, not for nothing, we have two men with the same name, both dead.
I mean, regardless of the method of murder, this doesn't sound like an accident.
Yeah, well, wait a minute.
the second vic's right hand was in early stages of rigor.
okay, what if they were fighting over the keys, and, in the struggle, fell over the railing?
that's what the killer was after at the pool.
that's why nothing was taken from my wallet.
it was my keys.
who's got a set of keys to the Avalanche?
I always close it.
it was open and on the floor.
this about car keys?
it can't be.
MacArthur Taylor's obituary described him as an avid walker.
he never even owned a car.
I've searched every credible database available, and have located 23 Mac Taylors within a 100-mile radius of Manhattan.
mac Taylor. Actually,
MacDonald Taylor, but everybody calls me Mac.
it's on my driver's license, credit cards, checks...
my full name is Mackito Taylor.
mac Taylor-- simple, easy.
most people remember it... -Mac Taylor, -or Machiavelli. -so I always went by that.
in the last two or three weeks? -I want everybody to call me that, one name.
no, I haven't noticed anything out of the ordinary.
should I be worried? -I live on the Upper West Side.
what's this about? I mean...
I'm not sure what else to tell you. -Why am I even here?
the two other Mac Taylors in the morgue
they look like me? No.
take a seat.
I'll have someone come talk to you, give you all the details.
Yeah, but they were both white males, right?
they were different ages.
one was an investment banker, the other a CPA.
you're a reporter.
there's nothing adding up here, okay?
now, if you sit down and be quiet, we might get something done.
let me sneak a peek at the autopsy reports.
Taylor, are you nuts?
come on, Flack.
I've worked the crime beat for four years.
I know you guys have to have a lead on this thing by now.
no. -All right.
I should know if some lunatic is gonna blow me away the second I step out onto the street.
trust me, Taylor, if I knew anything,
I'd let you know, but between you and me, if someone's taking a shot at you, it's not necessarily connected to this case.
Hey.
we got 12 Mac Taylors and counting.
are you in charge here?
Yes.
how far along are you on this thing?
they're telling me that I got to stick around here until you figure it all out.
I'm guessing we're not talking about a few hours here.
we're trying to save lives.
we're making arrangements to provide protection.
from who?
you don't even know who you're after.
we're working on it.
in the meantime, it's best that you remain in our custody.
look, I completely understand the frustration you're feeling.
you're kidding me, right?
I mean, I get a call an hour ago from somebody telling me that I need to report to this precinct because someone's trying to kill me.
and you understand my frustration?
I'm sorry. I didn't get your name.
I'm sure we'd all like to know the name of the officer who understands our frustration.
it's Detective.
detective Mac Taylor.
Yeah.
right now.
it was Stella. We got another victim.
this one's alive.
okay, MacKendra.
I'm going to swab your wounds to see if there's any trace evidence left behind.
if at any point, it's too rough, or you just feel uncomfortable, you let me know, okay?
can you call me Mac?
MacKendra's what my parent used to call me when I was in trouble.
all right, Mac.
did he scrape you here?
Yeah. I think it was something on his clothing.
why don't you tell me exactly what happened.
I was walking to my car.
it was late.
do you always walk to your car alone?
no.
I usually get a spot right in front.
I work at the front desk at the Chase Regent Hotel.
I wish I would have just given him my keys.
is that what he wanted?
Hey, what kind of car do you drive?
Why? What do you want?
I don't want to hurt you, Mac.
I just want to see your car keys.
I kept thinking, if I just keep my keys and I just get to the car,
I'll be okay, you know?
did I mess up?
what do you mean?
I washed my hands when I got home.
no, it's okay.
there could still be trace under your nails.
I don't know why I didn't just run away as soon as I heard someone behind me, and why I even talked to him.
I'm sorry. I'm really embarrassed.
I don't really know if I can answer your questions.
it's okay.
you don't have to, Mac.
as soon as he saw MacKendra's car, he took off.
so we're back to the theory that this is about a car?
our killer's not after every Mac Taylor in this city.
he's targeting only one.
and he's checking keys because he doesn't have a description of the Mac Taylor he's looking for.
only a description of the type of car that he or she drives.
MacArthur Taylor didn't own a car.
killer didn't know that until he read the obituary.
MacArthur Taylor's death was a mistake.
and checking the keys of his next target prevents the killer from making another one.
Hawkes was right.
the early rigor in our vic's right hand was because he was holding on to those keys.
so when the killer went after them, somewhere in the struggle, the vic fell.
it was an accident.
but the guy brought a gun to the scene, Stella.
the gun is for the Mac Taylor he wants dead.
when he finds the right one, he'll use it.
the killer had already checked my keys and determined I wasn't the target.
which means he's still hunting for the right Mac Taylor.
really weird.
what?
the shard that Lindsay found at the crime scene of the stairwell vic
I found traces of unknown female blood.
okay. Means it doesn't belong to our killer or our vic.
stranger than that.
the shard itself, it's bone, but it's not human.
it's deer antler.
the bullet Sid pulled out of our first vic, MacArthur Taylor, just got a hit.
matches a slug from a burglary in a parking garage.
that was three weeks ago.
we've had this slug for quite a while.
we're just now connecting it to the bullet in MacArthur Taylor's chest?
property crime, low priority.
the data was just entered into IBIS.
bullet was found in the baseboard.
looked like the gun went off by accident.
nothing was taken, so I guess they didn't think it was that important.
no positive ID, but we got a good description of the shooter.
so how do we find this guy?
that's what's up. You get on that.
check your back field.
that's Starksy and Hutch just showed up.
I'm gonna get out of here.
this ain't my type of crowd.
be safe.
do I know you?
I don't think so, buddy.
what's up, Crockett?
we need to find a guy.
rattled a parking garage on the Upper East Side.
6'2," brown hair, scar over his left eye.
Oh, so he looks like you, only taller.
that's good. You're killing me.
tattoo on his neck.
we need a lead on this one, Terrence.
that's a pretty generic description, man.
did I not mention scar above his eye, tattoo on his neck?
how many guys you know like that?
six? Seven? Eight?
come on, just give us the names. We'll do the work.
look, don't you got some type of test tube,
DNA, fingerprint dust that can point you in the right direction?
listen to me.
somebody in your little entourage knows this guy, okay?
we made a deal.
you're a confidential informant, and this little powwow that we're having is payup time.
I'm aware of the deal we made, man, but y'all can't keep coming up here with this small change.
I'm beginning to smell like pork.
you certainly surround yourself with some beautiful young ladies.
I see a couple fresh faces in the room.
what do you think, Dan-O? She look 21 to you?
16, maybe 17.
I'll tell you what.
I'll reach out.
the guy you looking for-- he'll be here tonight.
Hey, though, why don't you just give us his name, address, and we'll skip your little party, all right?
I don't roll like that, man.
where are you from, Staten Island?
Oh, that's funny?
that guy, before
I think that was Marshall Faulk.
yeah?
I was thinking Tiki Barber.
the bone I found-- it's a deer antler button.
this is the crime scene photo of the antler shard that Lindsay found, all right?
it's pretty clear that it's circular in nature, but I couldn't quite figure out what the little notch was.
right. Now that you know it's a button, it's the eye for the thread.
exactly.
but there was one problem.
we couldn't be sure that this piece of trace had anything to do with the murder of our vic, or if it had been there before.
I lifted a partial print from the surface of the shard, and it was a match to our killer.
we have our killer's prints?
handprint. From the Plexiglas.
MacKendra's attacker put his hand over her mouth.
traces of her makeup transferred onto his palm and his fingertips.
her makeup contained titanium, so, using the mass spectrometer,
I was able to isolate the prints that contained titanium.
and this was the last print left on the Plexiglas surface.
there was nothing on top of it.
so we ran it against the partial from the deer antler button, -and it was a match. -Only bad news.
no hits in AFIS.
right, but the partial print we got off the button confirms that it came from our killer's clothing.
now, where does one find a button made of deer antler?
dorsey's Notions on Third.
they gave me an entire list of anyone who had purchased such a button in the last year.
a list of one.
fantastic.
we made an effort to make our designs as unique as possible.
no.
we gave away more than we sold.
who is "we"? -Melinda Kitano.
I was the inept accountant.
was?
Yeah, we're formerly Kitano-Oka designs, but we're moving on and out.
do you have a forwarding address for Melinda?
no.
Yeah, no, she was also my girlfriend.
so, the business wasn't the only thing I lost.
I'm sorry. Excuse me.
sure. -Sorry.
Hello?
Hi, what's up?
I backed into the fender, broke a light on my car, dented the bumper of the other.
I waited, but I had to pick up my kids, so I left a note with my number.
no one ever called.
did you mention in your note what kind of car you drove?
no.
when I got here this morning, there was 15 of us.
now there's only seven.
why'd everybody else get to go home?
well, one of us has a record.
what was that?
get your hands off me. -Hey, hey.
what are you gonna do about it? -Get out of my face.
Hey, cut it out. Sit down.
sit your ass down.
the killer's tracking down each of us.
he could have been in your homes already, stood outside your job, been right in your face.
doesn't appear he's giving up.
what kind of car do you drive?
a Thunderbird.
it's parked in a long-term lot over on Lexington.
I haven't been in it for over a month.
Where'd you go a month ago?
Buffalo.
anything out of the ordinary happen?
uh, it didn't snow.
this is it?
this is your line of questioning in connection with a murder investigation, Detective?
I've been here for over eight hours.
I have endured all the questioning I care to.
there's a man out there who wants a Mac Taylor dead.
I have the good fortune of knowing it's not me.
you really want to walk out of this building and risk the chance that you're his target?
I appreciate your concern for my safety, but I'll take the risk.
I'm the one.
I'm the one he's after.
what makes you think that, Mac?
I didn't...
leave a note. -What?
the car I hit. I said I left a note.
I didn't. Maybe he's after me.
what the hell?
I don't think Terrence likes people walking on his furniture.
what are you thinking?
man.
wake up there, Perry;
I'm gonna give you one more chance to do some talking.
come on. What do you got?
Perry, you're facing two counts of first-degree murder, assault on two police officers, burglary, parole violation...
possession of a concealed weapon.
Yeah.
destruction of private property, spying on your sister.
she looked good naked.
listen to me.
we're willing to make a deal here. Okay?
all you got to do is tell us who you sold the gun to.
a deal?
what am I dealing for?
I'll get 30 days, I'll be out in six?
my biggest crime is that I broke into an empty parking garage office on Lexington.
who's pressing charges on that?
MacQuinn Taylor mentioned he parked his car at a garage on Lexington;
find him.
you got me in Brooklyn. Now what?
I believe our killer was here after he attacked MacKendra Taylor and right before he moved on to Mac at the pool.
the leaf we collected from the Athletic Club pool was saturated with saltwater.
same thought I had, so I tested the leaf, and I found a high concentration of sodium chloride, but also magnesium, calcium, sulfur, and potassium, all inconsistent with the components of the saltwater in the pool.
it was sea salt, which led me to one place.
the Art Installation Waterfall.
coated all the vegetation around it with salt.
Yes, causing discoloration of the foliage.
our leaf came from here.
I mean, a lot of people have access to the Brooklyn Bride and the waterfront, so anyone could have moved the trace onto a subway or a cab, and it somehow ended up on our killer's shoe.
I thought of that. -Okay.
now, we collected a latent footprint by the pool at the Athletic Club.
that footprint matches a partial print that I found here at the base of a tree that has the same leaf that we found poolside.
okay, so that puts our killer in this location, but the amount of possible suspects is impossible.
this where is where I found the partial.
as you can tell from the partial footprint, it's the toe of the shoe, which might occur if someone was kneeling.
so, cut flowers, candle wax, kneeling.
you have a vigil.
possibly in memory of someone's death.
possibly motive.
doc, you just narrowed down our suspect pool.
some might consider this harassment, Detective.
you gave us permission to look at your vehicle.
like that won't make me look guilty of whatever it is you've decided I'm involved in.
there's a man out there killing people, and this parking lot puts him closer to you.
look, I don't know this Perry Samuels guy who broke into this place.
and what my car has to do with any of it is a mystery to me.
just maybe I can solve that mystery.
all right, so this is the skinny from the parking attendant.
showed up for work the morning after the robbery.
lock on the door was busted.
bullet impact marks on the bottom of the door.
and this notebook was opened up to this page.
it's the parking stall assignments.
our first vic, MacArthur Taylor, was found dead outside a building two blocks away.
the killer naturally assumed he was the same Mac Taylor who parked his car here until he read the obituary and discovered that that Mac Taylor didn't own a car.
then, he went to his next closest and possible target.
our second vic's building is two blocks south, but he knew he had to check the keys.
let's see what the killer's connection is to this car and Mac Taylor.
he looking a little fidgety to you?
we got damage here.
you repair your car after an accident?
fender bender with a cab.
idiot didn't even turn around.
looks like blood.
I hit a dog.
before or after you hit the cab?
Hello?
that's not canine. That's human.
Hey, get this.
no hits in CODIS on the blood that you found on the car, but it did match the unknown female sample that Adam found on the shard of the deer antler button.
the button was from the killer's shirt, right?
right. MacKendra said that something on the killer's clothing scratched her.
can't be her blood.
doesn't fit the time line.
MacKendra's attack was after our stairwell victim.
so whose blood is it?
you know, it's an odd-shaped button.
it would have to been sewn on by hand.
you hold it against the fabric.
the blood is from the person who sewed the button on the shirt.
Lindsay, I want you to run the name Melinda Kitano into our aided database and see if you can get a hit.
whoa.
Melinda Kitano died two months ago.
a victim of an unsolved hit-and-run near the Brooklyn Bridge.
Melinda Kitano died in a hit-and-run, and the man that drove the car was MacQuinn Taylor.
it was MacQuinn our killer was after all along.
well, if revenge is the motive, then Melinda's boyfriend David Oka is suddenly our #1 suspect.
now, he said it wasn't just his business that he lost.
and that would explain the evidence of a vigil under the Brooklyn Bridge.
and how the leaf got to the pool when he came after you.
why didn't he know that MacQuinn was behind the wheel?
all right, by now, David's gotta know we're on to him now.
we need to find Mac Taylor and David Oka.
david Oka. NYPD. Open the door.
open it up.
chain's on the door.
fire escape. Right down to the street.
he's long gone. Canvass the area.
Yes, sir.
this kid was obsessed, huh?
Yeah.
looks like he changed his mind about skipping town.
we gotta find this guy. It's not over.
I need an APB on a David Oka.
no priors. 625 Myrtle.
someone call EMS. He's drenched himself in goline.
right in front of you.
that's it.
just slowly put it down.
put it down, David.
David, we have the man who killed Melinda.
had a few too many beers, maybe?
your car slammed right into her.
what makes someone just drive away?
I was told that I wasn't going to have to be here long.
David, you don't have to do this.
no, no, David, David.
David, drop the gun.
I saw the car.
you didn't stay around long enough to find out if Melinda Kitano was dead or alive.
Melinda. That's her name.
the driver had the car repaired.
did you know that?
you couldn't even tell that he hit her.
someone saw your brake lights.
you actually slowed down.
you thought about stopping. What happened at that moment?
saving someone else's life was a little harder than saving your own?
I'd like to make a call to my attorney.
david Oka pounded on the trunk of your car.
he just wanted you to help him save her.
wait!
Oh, my God! Melinda?
I don't remember that night.
david does.
it was as if it never happened!
it...
it was an accident!
I wanted to kill him!
I wanted to take his life!
but I am not responsible for those people that he killed.
for those other Mac Taylors that died.
I had no way of knowing that it would turn into this.
it was just an accident.
David! David, no!
Hey, it was an accident!
it was just an accident.
Hey, it's me.
how's David Oka?
he's at County. In surgery.
he's in critical condition, Mac.
I don't know if he's going to make it.
you know, this doesn't justify what he did, but he really loved her.
Yeah, it makes you think.
you should make the most of the moments you share with the people you care about.
Absolutely.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Yeah.
Hey.
Hey.
what are you still doing here?
some friends of mine stood me up for pizza.
mind if I join you? -Oh, no. Yeah, please.
okay, so what do we got?
that doesn't look like work.
it really isn't. I was just curious.
you know there are three Sheldon Hawkes in New York State.
and there are ten Danny Messers.
ten. -Yeah.
don't tell Danny that.
there's also another six other Adam Rosses, and there's 18 in New York State.
or what kind of lives do they live.
you know?
all right, what about me?
all right,
there's only one.
trust me. That's enough.
let's try Sid.
it's a 90-year-old woman.
Yeah, I think he was named after his mother.
all right, Don Flack.
Ooh, six.
six Don Flacks. -Six.
don Flack. Detective... -Don Flack.
new to the team.
lots of people to impress and intimidate.
night.
you know, I was, uh,
I was hoping I could have a redo on that first impression
sure, let me, uh, dump this stuff, and I'll be right back.
nice.
we're seconds away. I can see the scene from here.
you sure about the victim's identity?
Yep, triple-checked it.
two victims within a week and a half with that same name can't be a coincidence.
any idea where our Mac is?
we've got another victim.
second one this week.
identified as Mac Taylor.
are you all right?
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.
what is it?
I'm his next target Stella.
how do you know that, Mac?
because he was just here.
something about it struck me as odd.
he definitely went through my wallet, but nothing was missing.
why would he take a risk?
well, that's just it, I'm here every morning alone for at least an hour.
when those two came in, he took off.
did they see anything?
no, just someone walking away.
if this guy's plan was to kill you, we can assume he'll try again.
so far, the only thing you have in common with our two prior victims is your name.
well, if that's how the killer's choosing his targets, we need to get to any other Mac Taylor before he does.
mac Taylor?
according to his driver's license "Macabee James Taylor,"
but his business cards, building directory and organ donor signature all read "Mac Taylor, CPA."
clenched hand.
cadaveric spasm?
Yeah, he definitely tried to hold on to something.
and there's bruising on his face, which suggests some kind of struggle.
this doesn't make any sense. - What?
the keys could not have bounced this far.
I don't understand how there can be two points of impact.
see these pieces of plastic?
they're from the victim's keychain.
obviously, it broke when he fell to the floor.
but I found some here.
and then some here near the body.
what kind of distance are we looking at?
15 feet?
right, well, that's my point.
they don't look like they were kicked or scattered.
I didn't find any in between the two points of impact; it's like the keys fell twice.
the obvious question is how does a keychain land here and end up over there?
obvious answer.
the killer picked them up and moved them.
Yeah, but why?
wait a minute.
that's got to be what the victim was holding on to.
his attacker grabbed the keychain, took what he was after, and left the rest behind.
mac Taylor victim No.1.
investment banker, artist, chairman of the art center restoration foundation.
he's been here over a week.
no one's come to claim the body.
we can't seem to find any family members.
unsolved murder, cod exsaguination from a gunshot wound.
good memory.
and gsr I collected from around the injury is a match to traces of gsr Hawkes found on the face of this morning's victim, Mac Taylor No.2.
but, Sid, our victim from this morning wasn't shot.
and no gun was recovered from the scene.
but there's evidence his attacker had a weapon.
crime scene photos Hawkes took of the victim's face show subdermal bruising in the shape of the frame of a small automatic.
so he carried a gun and never shot it?
and if he had, he wouldn't have missed.
notice the "v" in the break.
it indicates the origination point of the fracture.
this injury was premortem, just prior to death.
and mobility would have been significantly impaired.
the victim could barely walk.
the killer could have taken aim and...
end of story.
so he shoots our first victim, Macarthur Taylor, point-blank right in the chest.
the second, he pistol-whips, and instead of shooting him, tosses him over the railing?
leaves me to conclude that the gun jammed.
or what if he never intend on killing him at all?
detective Taylor?
deputy inspector Gillian Whitford.
it's nice to finally meet you.
welcome to the division.
Thanks.
it'd be great if we could grab a coffee.
I'll check my schedule and give you a call.
there's no need to do that.
I'm free now.
thank you.
inspector, we're both very busy, so simply put, if you tracked me down to ask that I remove myself from the Mac Taylor murder investigation,
I'm afraid you're going to endure this mediocre cup of coffee for nothing.
I see you're not the type to concern himself with first impressions.
I'm sorry for being too direct.
I just don't want to waste your time.
detective, if there's one thing I've learned throughout my career as a law enforcement officer, it's that you should always do your homework.
that said, your reputation precedes you.
I believe the words "stubborn" and "strong-willed" were mentioned more than once.
you know the risks.
I just want you to use your best judgment.
I took the liberty of reviewing some of your high-profile cases.
you've put away quite a few dangerous offenders.
I can't imagine any of them were happy about it.
suggesting revenge for something I've done as our killer's motive?
I want you to consider it as a possibility.
I don't believe you're the target.
it's just that this case fits the classic profile of retaliation.
which means if this guy wants my attention, he's not done yet.
you're thinking our second victim was an accident?
our killer came to the crime scene with a gun.
he's used it before.
why didn't he use it here?
now, Sid suggested that the gun might've jammed, but we don't have any proof of that.
I processed the stairwell and I found our victim's prints on the handle of every door from floor 99 to 95, so clearly, they were locked and he was trying to get in.
then on the 91st floor, the door was unlocked, and I found drag and scuff marks.
he wasn't walking.
more than likely he tripped, fell down downstairs.
that's when he broke his ankle.
at which point the killer had ample opportunity to aim and fire.
guys, not for nothing, we have two men with the same name, both dead.
I mean, regardless of the method of murder, this doesn't sound like an accident.
Yeah, well, wait a minute.
the second victim's right hand was in early stages of rigor.
okay, what if they were fighting over the keys, and, in the struggle, fell over the railing?
that's what the killer was after at the pool.
that's why nothing was taken from my wallet.
it was my keys.
who's got a set of keys to the Avalanche?
I always close it.
it was open and on the floor.
this about car keys?
it can't be.
MacArthur Taylor's obituary described him as an avid walker.
he never even owned a car.
I've searched every credible database available, and have located 23 Mac Taylor within a 100-mile radius of Manhattan.
actually, Macdonald Taylor, but everybody calls me Mac.
it's on my drivers license, credit cards, checks...
my full name is Mackito Taylor.
mac Taylor-- simple, easy.
most people remember it...You know, so I always went by that.
in the last two or three weeks?
no, I haven't noticed anything out of the ordinary.
should I be worried?
what's this about? I mean...
I'm not sure what else to tell you.
the two other Mac Taylors in the morgue-- they look like me?
no. Take a seat.
I'll have someone come talk to you, give you all the details.
Yeah, but they were both white males, right?
they were different ages.
one was an investment banker, the other a CPA.
you're a reporter.
there's nothing adding up here, okay?
now, if you sit down and be quiet, we might get something done.
let me sneak a peek at the autopsy reports.
Taylor, are you nuts?
come on, Flack.
I've worked the crime beat for four years.
I know you guys have to have a lead on this thing by now.
I should know if some lunatic is gonna blow me away the second I step out onto the street.
trust me, Taylor, if I knew anything, I'd let you know, but between you and me, if someone's taking a shot at you, it's not necessarily connected to this case.
Hey.
we got 12 Mac Taylors and counting.
are you in charge here?
Yes.
how far along are you on this thing?
they're telling me that I got to stick around here until you figure it all out.
I'm guessing we're not talking about a few hours here.
we're trying to save lives.
we're making arrangements to provide protection.
from who?
you don't even know who you're after.
we're working on it.
in the meantime, it's best that you remain in our custody.
look, I complete understand the frustration you're feeling.
you're kidding me, right?
I mean, I get a call an hour ago from somebody telling me that
I need to report to this precinct because someone's trying to kill me.
and you understand my frustration?
I'm sorry. I didn't get your name.
I'm sure we'd all like to know the name of the officer who understands our frustration.
it's detective.
detective Mac Taylor.
Yeah.
right now.
it was Stella. We got another victim.
this one's alive.
okay, MacKendra.
I'm going to swab your wounds to see if there's any trace evidence left behind.
if at any point, it's too rough, or you just feel uncomfortable, you let know, okay?
can you call me Mac?
MacKendra's what my parents used to call me when I was in trouble.
all right, Mac.
did he scrape you here?
Yeah. I think it was something on his clothing.
why don't you tell me exactly what happened.
uh...I was walking to my car.
it was late.
do you always walk to your car alone?
no. Uh, I usually get a spot right in front.
um...I work at the front desk at the Chase Regent hotel.
I wish I would have just given him my keys.
is that what he wanted?
Hey, what kind of car do you drive?
Why? What do you want?
I don't want to hurt you, Mac.
I just want to see your car keys.
where the hell are your keys?
I kept thinking, if I just keep my keys and I just get to the car, I'll be okay, you know?
did I mess up?
what do you mean?
I washed my hands when I got home.
no, it's okay. There could still be trace under your nails.
I don't know why I didn't just run away as soon as I heard someone behind me, and why I even talked to him.
I'm sorry I'm really embarrassed.
I don't really know if I can answer your questions.
it's okay.
you don't have to, Mac.
as soon as he saw MacKendra's car, he took off.
so we're back to the theory that this is about a car?
our killer's not after every Mac Taylor in this city.
he's targeting only one.
and he's checking keys because he doesn't have a description of the Mac Taylor he's looking for.
only a description of the type of car that he or she drives.
MacArthur Taylor didn't own a car.
killer didn't know that until he read the obituary.
MacArthur Taylor's death was a mistake.
and checking the keys of his next target prevents the killer from making another one.
Hawkes was right.
the early rigor in our victim's right hand was because he was holding on to those keys.
so when the killer went after them, somewhere in the struggle, the victim fell.
it was an accident.
but the guy brought a gun to the scene, Stella.
the gun is for the Mac Taylor he wants dead.
when he finds the right one, he'll use it.
the man and woman who entered the pool didn't interrupt an attempt on my life.
the killer had already checked my keys and determined I wasn't the target.
which means he's still hunting for the right Mac Taylor.
really weird.
what?
the shard that Lindsay found at the crime scene of the stairwell victim.
I found traces of unknown female blood.
okay. Means it doesn't belong to tour killer or our victim.
stranger than that.
the shard itself, it's bone, but it's not human.
it's deer antler.
the bullet Sid pulled out of our first victim, Macarthur Taylor, just got a hit.
matches a slug from a burglary in a parking garage.
that was three weeks ago.
we've had this slug for quite a while.
we're just now connecting it to the bullet in Macarthur Taylor's chest?
property crime, low priority.
the data was just entered into IBIS.
bullet was found in the baseboard.
looked like the gun went off by accident.
nothing was taken, so I guess they didn't think it was that important.
no positive ID, but we got a good description of the shooter.
so how do we find this guy?
that's what's up. You get on that.
check your back field.
that's Starksy and Hutch just showed up.
I'm gonna get out of here.
this ain't my type of crowd.
be safe.
do I know you?
I don't think so, buddy.
what's up, Crockett?
we need to find a guy.
rattled a parking garage on the upper east side.
6'2," brown hair, scar over his left eye.
Oh, so he looks like you, only taller.
that's good. You're killing me.
tattoo on his neck.
we need a lead on this one, Terrence.
that's a pretty generic description, man.
did I not mention scar above his eye, tattoo on his neck?
how many guys you know like that?
six? Seven? Eight?
come on, just give us the names.
we'll do the work.
look, don't you got some type of test tube, DNA, fingerprint dust that can point you the right direction?
listen to me.
somebody in your little entourage knows this guy, okay?
we made a deal.
you're a condential informant, and this little powwow that we're having is payup time.
I'm aware of the deal we made, man, but you all can't keep coming up here with this small charge.
I'm beginning to smell like pork.
you certainly surround yourself with some beautiful young ladies.
I see a couple fresh faces in the room.
what do you think, Danny? She look 21 to you?
16, maybe 17.
I'll tell you what.
I'll reach out.
the guy you are looking for-- he'll be here tonight.
Hey, though, why don't you just give us his name, address, and we'll skip your little party, all right?
I don't roll like that, man.
where are you from, Staten Island?
Oh, that's funny?
that guy, before-- I think that was Marshall Faulk.
yeah?
I was thinking Tiki Barber.
the bone I found-- it's a deer antler button.
this is the crime scene photo of the antler shard that Lindsay found, all right?
it's pretty clear that it's circular in nature, but I couldn't quite figure out what the little notch was.
right. Now that you know it's a button, it's the eye for the thread.
exactly.
but there was one problem.
we couldn't be sure that this piece of trace had anything to do with the murder of our victim, or if it had been there before.
I lifted a partial print from the surface of the shard, and it was a match to our killer.
we have our killer's prints?
handprint.
from the plexiglas.
MacKendra's attacker put his hand over her mouth.
traces of her makeup transferred onto his palm and his fingers.
her makeup contained titanium, so, using the mass spectrometer,
I was able to isolate the prints that contained titanium.
and this was the last print left on the plexus surface.
there was nothing on top of it.
so we ran it against the partial from the deer antler button, and it was a match.
only bad news.
no hits in AFIS.
right, but the partial print we got of the button confirms that it came from our killer's clothing.
now, where does one find a button made of deer antler?
dorsey's notions on third.
they gave me an entire list of anyone who had purchased such a button in the last year.
a list of one.
fantastic.
we used the buttons for shirts and jackets.
some for overcoats.
we made an effort to make our designs as unique as possible.
do you have a list of customers you sold some of those items to?
uh, no.
the line wasn't very successful, and unfortunately, we gave away more than we sold.
who is "we"?
my partner-- she was the brilliant designer.
I was the inept accountant.
was?
Yeah, we're formerly Kitano-Oka designs, but we're moving on and out.
do you have a forwarding address for Melinda?
no.
Yeah, no, she was also my girlfriend.
so, the business wasn't the only thing I lost.
I'm sorry. Excuse me.
sure.
Hello?
Hi, what's up?
I backed into the fender, broke a light on my car, dented the bumper of the other.
I waited, but I had to pick up my kids, so I left a note with my number.
no one ever called.
did you mention in your note what kind of car you drove?
no.
when I got here this morning, there was 15 of us.
now there's only seven.
why'd everybody else get to go home?
three of them were children.
the rest don't own cars.
this is crazy, man-- what makes you think this is something one of us did?
well, one of us has a record.
what was that?
somebody with previous criminal activity just might...
are you accusing me of something? - Get your hands off me.
what are you gonna do about it? - Get out of my face.
Hey, cut it out.
sit down.
sit your ass down.
the killer's tracking down each of us.
he could have been in your homes already, stood outside your job, been right in your face.
he's looking for one of you.
doesn't appear he's giving up.
what kind of car do you drive?
a thunderbird.
it's parked in a long-term lot over on Lexington.
I haven't been in it for over a month.
Where'd you go a month ago?
anything out of the ordinary happen?
uh, it didn't snow.
this is it?
this is your line of questioning in connection with a murder investigation, detective?
I've been here for over eight hours.
I have endured all the questioning I care to.
there's a man out there who wants a Mac Taylor dead.
I have the good fortune of knowing it's not me.
you really want to walk out of this building and risk the chance that you're his target?
I appreciate your concern for my safety, but I'll take the risk.
I'm the one.
I'm the one he's after.
what makes you think that, Mac?
I didn't...leave a note.
what?
the car I hit.
I said I left a note.
I didn't.
maybe he's after me.
what the hell?
I don't think Terrence likes people walking on his furniture.
what are you thinking?
man.
wake up there, Perry; I'm gonna give you one more chance to do some talking.
come on. What do you got?
the only thing I'm telling you is I'm not telling you nothing.
Ooh, Perry, you're facing two counts of first-degree murder, assault on two police officers, burglary, parole violation...
possession of a concealed weapon. - Yeah.
uh, destruction of private property, spying on your sister.
she looked good naked.
I told you I sold the gun.
that's what you get from me.
listen to me.
we're willing to make a deal here. Okay?
all you got too is tell us who you sold the gun to.
a deal?
what am I dealing for?
I'll get 30 days, I'll be out in six?
my biggest crime is that I broke into an empty parking garage office on Lexington.
who's pressing charges on that?
I need the crime report from the first officer on the scene of the burglary.
MacQuinn Taylor mentioned he parked his car at a garage on Lexington; find him.
we need to take a look at that vehicle.
you got me in Brooklyn.
now what?
I believe our killer was here after he attacked MacKendra Taylor and right before he moved on to Mac at the pool.
the leaf we collected from the athletic club pool was saturated with saltwater.
well, that makes sense 'cause the club's pool is a saltwater pool.
same thought I had, so I tested the leaf, and I found a high concentration of sodium chloride, but also magnesium, calcium, sulfur, and potassium, all inconsistent with the components of the saltwater in the pool.
it was sea salt, which led me to one place.
the art installation waterfall.
so the spray from the waterfall coated all the vegetation around it with salt.
Yes, causing discoloration of the foliage.
our leaf came from here.
okay, but that doesn't mean that the guy we're looking for is here.
I mean, a lot of people have access to the Brooklyn bride and the waterfront, so anyone could have moved the trace onto a subway or a cab, and it somehow ended up on our killer's shoe.
I thought of that.
now, we collected a latent footprint by the pool at the athletic club.
that footprint matches a partial print that I found here at the base of a tree that has the same leaf that we found poolside.
okay, so that puts our killer in this location, but the amount of possible suspects is impossible.
Oh, but you thought of that, too, didn't you?
this where is where I found the partial.
I also found dead cut flowers and what appears to be candle wax.
as you can tell from the partial footprint, it's the toe of the shoe, which might occur if someone was kneeling.
so, cut flowers, candle wax, kneeling.
you have a vigil.
possibly in memory of someone's death.
possibly motive.
doctor, you just narrowed down our suspect pool.
some might consider this harassment, detective.
you gave us permission to look at your vehicle.
you can change your mind.
Oh, yeah, right.
like that won't make me look guilty of whatever it is you've decided I'm involved in.
I'm not here to accuse you, Macquinn.
I'm just trying to find answers.
there's a man out there killing people, and this parking lot puts him closer to you.
look, I don't know this Perry Samuels guy who broke into this place.
and what my car has to do with any of it is a mystery to me.
well, then, why don't you just step aside and let me do my job.
just maybe I can solve that mystery.
all right, so this is the skinny from the parking attendant.
showed up for work the morning after the robbery.
lock on the door was busted.
bullet impact marks on the bottom of the door.
and this notebook was opened up to this page.
it's the parking stall assignments.
e3, Mac Taylor.
that's how he knew the name.
Yep, but to protect their clients, they don't keep any other personal information on the premises.
our first victim, Macarthur Taylor, was found dead outside a building two blocks away.
the killer naturally assumed he was the same Mac Taylor who parked his car here until he read the obituary and discovered that that Mac Taylor didn't own a car.
then, he went to his next closest and possible target.
our second victim's building is two blocks south, but he knew he had to check the keys.
let's see what the killer's connection is to this car and Mac Taylor.
he looking a little fidgety to you?
we got damage here.
you repair your car after an accident?
fender bender with a cab.
idiot didn't even turn around.
looks like blood.
I hit a dog.
before or after you hit the cab?
Hello?
that's not canine.
that's human.
we've got Adam searching for all deaths around the Brooklyn Bridge area in the last year.
Hey, get this.
no hits in codis on the blood that you found on the car, but it did match the unknown female sample that Adam found on the shard of the deer antler button.
the button was from the killer's shirt, right?
right. MacKendra said that something on the killer's clothing scratched her.
can't be her blood.
doesn't fit the time line.
MacKendra's attack was after our stairwell victim.
so whose blood is it?
you know, it's an odd-shaped button.
it would have to be sewn on by hand.
you hold it against the fabric.
you have to put the needle through the eyelets from the back, often you prick your thumb.
the blood is from the person who sewed the button on the shirt.
Lindsay, I want you to run the name Melinda Kitano into our aided database and see if you can get a hit.
Melinda Kitano died two months ago.
a victim of an unsolved hit-and-run near the Brooklyn Bridge.
Melinda Kitano died in a hit-and-run, and the man that drove the car was Macquinn Taylor.
inspector Whitford suggested this was a case of revenge and retaliation.
it was Macquinn our killer was after all along.
well, if revenge is the motive, then Melinda's boyfriend David Oka is suddenly our No.1 suspect.
now, he said it wasn't just his business that he lost.
and that would explain the evidence of a vigil under the Brooklyn Bridge.
and how the leaf got to the pool when he came after you.
according to the car accident report, he was at the scene.
why didn't he know that Macquinn was behind the wheel?
the car's windows are tinted.
no one saw the driver.
all right, by now, David's gotta know we're on to him now.
which means he's either on the run or that much closer to killing the right target.
we need to find Mac Taylor and David Oka.
david Oka. NYPD. Open the door.
open it up.
chain's on the door.
fire escape.
right down to the street.
he's long gone.
canvass the area.
Yes, Sir.
this kid was obsessed, huh?
I saw the car! Lexington avenue!
Yeah.
he saw his girlfriend die.
and then he found the car.
stel, packed suitcase, passport, train ticket.
all still here.
looks like he changed his mind about skipping town.
we gotta find this guy.
it's not over.
I need an APB on a David Oka.
no priors. Current address: 625 Myrtle.
someone call ems. He's drenched himself in gasoline.
David, I know you have a gun.
I need you to take it out slowly and just place it down on the ground, okay.
right in front of you.
that's it.
just slowly put it down.
put it down, David.
David, we have the man who killed Melinda.
you were in your brand-new car, tinted windows, no license plate.
had a few too many beers, maybe?
your car slammed right into her.
what makes someone just drive away?
I was told that I wasn't going to have to be here long.
I would just have to answer a few questions and then be released to go home.
David, you don't have to do this.
just take the gun, put it down on the ground right in front of you.
no, no, David, David.
David, drop the gun.
I saw the car.
you didn't stay around long enough to find out if Melinda Kitano was dead or alive.
that's her name.
the driver had the car repaired.
did you know that?
you couldn't even tell that he hit her.
someone saw your brake lights.
you actually slowed down.
you thought about stopping.
what happened at that moment?
saving someone else's life was a little harder than saving your own?
I'd like to make a call to my attorney.
david Oka pounded on the trunk of your car.
he just wanted you to help him save her.
she's pinned under the wheel.
you have to help me!
wait!
Oh, my god!
I don't remember that night.
david does.
it was as if it never happened!
but it did!
it did!
it happened right there!
all you had to do was stop.
that's quite a story, huh?
it... it was an accident!
I wanted to kill him!
I wanted to take his life!
but I am not responsible for those people that he killed.
for those other Mac Taylors that died.
I had no way of knowing that it would turn into this.
it was just an accident.
David, no! - Hey, it was an accident!
it was just an accident.
Hey, it's me.
how's David Oka?
he's at county. In surgery.
he's in critical condition, Mac.
uh, I don't know if he's going to make it.
you know, this doesn't justify what he did, but he really loved her.
Yeah, it makes you think.
you should make the most of the moments you share with the people you care about.
Absolutely.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Yeah.
Hey. Hey.
what are you still doing here?
Oh, uh, some friends of mine stood me up for pizza.
so, uh, just staying on top of things, you know.
mind if I join you?
Oh, no.
Yeah, please.
okay, so what do we got?
that doesn't look like work.
it really isn't.
I was just curious.
you know there are three Sheldon Hawkes in New York State.
and there are ten Danny Messers.
ten.
Yeah.
don't tell Danny that.
there's also another six other Adam Rosses, and there's 18 in New York State.
I was just sitting here wondering about, you know, what do they look like, or what kind of lives do they live.
you know?
all right, what about me?
all right, Stella Bonasera.
there's only one.
trust me.
that's enough.
let's try Sid.
it's a...90-year-old woman.
Yeah, I think he was named after his mother.
all right, Don Flack.
Ooh, six.
wow, six Don Flacks.
six.
I like that name-- Don Flack. Don Flack. - Detective...
you're working late.
new to the team.
lots of people to impress and intimidate.
night.
you know, I was, uh, I was hoping I could have a redo on that first impression and buy you a cup of coffee.
that would be great.
let me check my schedule and...
no need for that.
I'm free now.
uh... sure, let me, uh, dump this stuff, and I'll be right back.
she turned back.
nice.
all of a sudden, he gets three stripes on his shoulders, he becomes a ball-breaker.
I remember when I was a rookie, he was the one that turned me on to all the best cooping spots in the precinct.
now the fat son of a bitch has got me working midnights 'cause he wants to keep an eye on my ass?
stop. Stop. Back up. I think we got something here.
go!
stop where you are! Police! Freeze!
get off the fence! Do it now!
detective Taylor?
of course.
do you really think that you'll find my father's killer?
Yes.
you doing a little late-night shopping?
I figured if I couldn't sleep...
might as well be productive.
cornflakes?
I thought cops were supposed to be adventurous.
we are.
look. See? I got a half gallon of milk here that expires in two days.
so how are you?
I'm good.
I went to see my mother yesterday.
it was hard for both of us.
I'm sure it can't be easy having your daughter visit you in prison.
go ahead. - Oh, no.
you only have a few things. Go. - All right.
I did have a little bit of good news recently.
yeah?
you know those cards that I collect with people's confessions?
it's going to be a book.
it's going to be published.
Congratulations. - Thanks.
you, uh... You want to have breakfast? My treat.
I'm sorry. I... I have to go.
of course. - It was nice to see you again.
Yeah.
Hey, Mac.
what have you got?
karma. His name's Tony Clark.
he's 27 years old.
according to his business card, he's a buyer for a department store chain.
there was a lot of useful information in his wallet.
unfortunately, I can't say the same thing for his victim.
got to love how crowded the city's gotten.
can't even dump a body in private anymore.
no external signs of trauma.
extremities are clean.
you think it could be a rape-murder?
no defensive wounds.
nothing to indicate a sexual motive.
internal bleeding.
let's get her over to Sid.
check this out.
Tony just got a text.
is it done yet?
looks like it's just beginning.
Flack ran the plate.
got an ID on our female vic.
let me guess. Isabelle Vaughn.
according to the prelim background, this kid was a rising star in the design world.
handbags, accessories.
had everything going for her.
except luck.
what about ours?
all we got is a red stain on the carpet.
it looks fresh.
some sort of vegetation?
probably transfer from a shoe.
but the thing is, there's no trace of it on our vic or our killer.
where did it come from?
maybe it was another driver.
maybe it's this person who sent the text message.
I have Flack reaching out to the phone company for a name, but cops who caught Tony dumping the body said he was alone when they caught him in the act.
there's no blood. No sign of a struggle.
Yup, it's all clean, except for this.
so, where's our primary crime scene?
uh, Hawkes, it's Sid.
uh, no, I'm not done, but you may want to come down a little early.
is all that liquid coming from her stomach?
that is her stomach and her liver and her pancreas.
her organs were liquefied, and continued melting well after her death.
Saponification?
that's my official COD.
that's a strange way to kill someone.
Oh, you want strange? Let's talk stomach contents.
both vics indulged in a rather curious buffet this evening.
both?
so they had dinner together before Isabelle was killed?
Oh, it would seem so.
we have citrus peels, dandelions, raw onions, vinegar, Tabasco, duck blood soup.
but Isabelle had one other item that Tony didn't:
large amounts of sodium hydroxide.
drain cleaner is the most common source.
and in order to do this kind of damage, she had to drink at least 18 ounces.
so this was no accidental ingestion?
right.
that's the only manner of death I can't rule out, but there's no evidence she was forced to drink it, either.
you're telling me that she drank a caustic, foul-tasting liquid voluntarily?
doesn't make any sense, I know.
but, Sid, if this was suicide, then why was Tony dumping the body?
thought you'd want to see this first.
name's Declan Rooney. 29 years old.
Oh, yeah. Snapped neck.
fingers are broken.
similar MO used by the man who murdered the Rat Fisherman three months ago.
and tried to kill you.
only he's in the wind.
well, if Sid confirms that this is his handiwork, he just blew back.
did you get anything off of those security cameras?
they're fake. Canal Street-- poor man's Madison Avenue.
but as far as I can tell, doesn't look like anything else is missing.
except for what might have been on here.
uh, elephant dung? Are you sure?
Yeah, they found it under Isabelle's fingernails.
came straight from Sid.
you know, you've been getting a lot of crappy case work lately.
that's cute.
I mean, you know, something like that, you know, you don't come in contact with every day.
you find the connection, I'm buying you a beer.
no. Beer's on me. You got some big expenses coming up.
Oh, yeah? What? Diapers? Nah. How much diapers cost?
come on. Forget diapers. I'm talking big picture here.
the cost of raising a kid from birth to 18 is, like, 150 grand.
and that's not including college.
how do you know that?
um, my father used to remind me every day about it, you know.
so I would just, you know, keep all the cash if I were you.
uh, but combining your income might be less painful.
thank you, Suze Orman. - Yeah.
Hey, Lindsay. - Hey, Adam.
I'll get back to you on the dung.
I thought you were searching Isabelle's apartment.
all clean. Uh, got to go to Tony's house now.
hopefully, find the primary crime scene there.
and how are we feeling? - Good.
I think I felt a kick this morning. - Really?
Yeah. - Come here.
they stopped.
next time it happens, you find me.
tell me this isn't one of your weird cravings.
only for science.
you were looking for me?
I was hoping to offer you a little snack.
well, let me guess.
this is another one of your famous reconstructions.
just put one of these berries in your mouth and swirl it around for a couple seconds.
Lindsay, I'm your boss. Not a guinea pig.
mac, I'm pregnant. Just humor me.
it's called synsepalum dulcificum.
it's the vegetative trace that Danny found in Isabelle's car.
now, when I tested it, I was able to isolate an active glycoprotein molecule called miraculin.
it's the main component of this berry.
it's found in West Africa.
it's also called the miracle fruit.
and what might that miracle be?
it alters your taste buds.
it makes bitter foods taste sweet.
uh, how long are my taste buds going to be altered?
for the rest of your life.
no, I'm kidding. Just for a few hours.
so, you might as well enjoy it. Go ahead. Try this onion.
that's good. That's really good.
this explains the strange stomach contents in our victims' bodies.
well, it also explains how Isabelle could have ingested a caustic substance without really tasting it.
so it confirms that she was murdered.
we still have no idea why.
and who's the accomplice who sent the text message?
head cheese, mouse brains, pigs' feet.
our boy Tony throws one hell of a party.
I think I just found our appetizer.
Ah, miracle fruit. This is wrong.
this is so wrong! Cod liver oil?
what the heck kind of sick party was this?
all this strange food is consistent with what Sid found in Tony and Isabelle's stomachs.
and all made edible by this miracle fruit.
Flack. Yeah?
pick her up. I'm on my way.
phone company gave us the name of the woman who sent Tony that text message.
name's Quinci Feeney. My guys are picking her up now.
I'll be in touch. - All right.
last night you sent a text message to your boyfriend Tony Clark asking if it was done.
you were referring to the body dump, weren't you?
ms. Feeney, right now I got you on conspiracy to dispose of a dead body.
but if you don't start answering our questions,
I will find a way to connect you to Isabelle Vaughn's murder.
I idolized Isabelle, but I barely knew her.
she was Tony's friend.
then why'd he kill her?
he didn't. When he found her, she was already dead.
sorry, everybody, party's over.
seriously, guys, I'm not messing around. I need you all to leave.
what's going on? - Come with me.
we had no idea what happened.
we thought maybe it was some sort of allergic reaction.
allergic reaction? - An accident.
then why didn't you call the cops? - Tony was scared.
Isabelle Vaughn was dead in his apartment.
and in Tony's business, image is everything.
he said the scandal would ruin him.
these the same clothes you were wearing at the party last night?
Yes. - I want to see your boots.
my boots? - Yeah. Put 'em on the table.
you helped move the body, didn't you?
see this?
we found similar trace in Isabelle's car.
Tony asked me to help him carry Isabelle to her car.
what are you doing?
baby, you're too drunk to drive.
no, I'm good.
Tony insisted on doing it himself.
well, how chivalrous of him.
the plan was for Tony to get rid of the body and then meet me in Long Island city so we could dump her car.
then I'd drive us back to the city in my car.
Tony never showed up.
I guess that's what happens when you decide to treat a human being like a piece of trash.
fate catches up.
doc, I got a blood trail.
all right, this is where it all went down.
no signs of struggle.
boom! Drain cleaner.
it's half empty.
contains bleach. The other main ingredient is sodium hydroxide.
could be our murder weapon.
all right, so everyone's at the party, riding high on this berry buzz, eating and drinking different concoctions.
Tony uses the opportunity to spike Isabelle's drink.
no wonder she never saw it coming.
sorry to keep you waiting.
thank you for seeing me.
you said it was urgent. What can I do for you?
okay. This may sound really out there, and I talked myself out of coming at least five times.
but I figured if it could help solve a murder, it was better for me to risk making a fool of myself than staying quiet.
what can help? What murder?
Isabelle Vaughn. It's all over the Internet.
her bags are on every must-have list.
and you think you have some information connected to her murder?
this was sent to me a few months ago.
see? These letters...
the "V" and the "I," and this flower-- that's her signature logo.
and the bright colors-- she uses them on every purse.
it's like the 'Isabelle Vaughn "thing.
so I figured whoever made this card had to be talking about her.
I want her dead.
Hey, everybody, Isabelle Vaughn here.
so Isabelle was your business partner?
that's right.
well, according to her lawyer, she was suing you for $30 million, plus the dissolving of your partnership, which would have cost you nearly ten times that in future revenue.
she was never going to win that frivolous lawsuit.
Isabelle Vaughn worked for me.
check her contract. I own the label.
her lawyer said she was a victim of an unfair deal with you.
they always say that when it comes time to renegotiate.
Yeah, but Isabelle wasn't looking to renegotiate.
she was looking to set up shop without you.
so says that bald, opportunistic midget lawyer of hers.
that man would have said anything to get me to cave.
detectives, I came here eight years ago from Thailand with nothing.
today, I'm one of the biggest women's accessory manufacturers in the country.
if you think someone like Isabelle Vaughn posed a threat to me, you're wrong.
look, detectives, if you knew anything about this business, you'd know that I made Isabelle.
I mean, she was sewing bags out of her dorm room when I found her.
but what happened between us was just business.
I moved on.
Yeah, you moved on, but the lawsuit didn't.
and it wasn't going away.
what's your point?
my point is I imagined you hated Isabelle.
probably wished she were dead.
generally, wishing and acting are two separate things.
not always.
look familiar?
this looks like one of Isabelle's designs.
this card was made with materials exclusive to your company.
where did you get this?
it was sent through the mail anonymously.
how are you with arts and crafts?
I'm sorry. I have no idea who made it or sent it.
what's up, Doc?
I tested everything at the party that could have been used to deliver the poison to Isabelle's glass.
they all came back with a pH between three and five.
just too acidic to be sodium hydroxide.
Yeah, nothing was close until I tested this.
PH: 14.
nice. So the sodium hydroxide was put in the blender.
Yeah, and poured from there directly into Isabelle's glass.
thank you. You get prints?
nothing usable. But there's still plenty of trace.
I'm trying to separate all the compounds.
if I can isolate every ingredient that's inside this blender, maybe it'll give us something to help identify the killer.
that is, unless you've got something better.
Nah, sodium hydroxide in Isabelle's system came back pure.
pure.
so, the drain cleaner we found in Tony's apartment isn't our murder weapon.
no, if it was, Isabelle would have bleach in her system, but she didn't.
pure sodium hydroxide is a laboratory chemical.
it's not exactly a typical household product.
that's true, so we need to figure out which one of Tony's guests would have that kind of access.
you don't see this method of murder very often.
it required a certain skill set. - Right.
same skill set it took to kill Wolford Bessie, the rat fisherman.
both Bessie's and Rooney's necks were snapped from left to right, and both have similar spiral fractures on the anterior arch of the C-1 vertebra.
the signature is special ops.
close contact, silent kill.
green Berets, Russian Spetsnaz, Mossad.
there's at least a half dozen forces that could have trained our killer.
Sebastian Diakos did this, Mac.
I mean, there are too many similarities for it to be a coincidence.
the only thing that connects the two is COD. What about motive?
the Greek Embassy introduced Diakos to me as an antiquities expert who specializes in ancient Greek artifacts.
now, our first vic, Wolford Bessie, was killed over an antique coin that turned out to be priceless.
rooney here owned a pawn shop.
my guess is he got his hands on something Diakos wanted.
I'm afraid I don't have much to steer you in a direction.
this was kept pretty clean.
tweezed this splinter from the vic's arm.
looks metallic.
it's all I got.
hopefully, it's all we'll need.
I'm fine, Mac. I just want to get this guy.
we all do.
what's up?
take a look at this.
looks like the coin we took off the rat fisherman.
Yeah, it does; found this display felt at a crime scene this morning.
performed a surface mapping for trace metals, and this image popped up.
Oh, they're identical.
king Philip II. 352 BC.
Sid tweezed a metallic splinter from my vic's arm.
turns out it had the same composition as the metal used to cover the first coin that we found.
okay, so we got a second coin, somehow smuggled from Greece to the streets of New York.
Diakos gets wind of it, steals it and hands us another body.
Yeah, I'm thinking we haven't seen the last of these coins.
you think there's more? - Yeah...
and Sebastian Diakos isn't gonna stop until he gets them all.
a lot of landlords still use these tokens in their laundry rooms.
not quite as creative as your past work.
I want creative, I'll do a paint-by-numbers.
I want to avoid eating maggot-infested prison slop. I'll do this.
Stan, I had Detective Angell set up this introduction.
I was hoping you would help me with a police investigation.
what's this?
it's an ancient Greek coin. It dates back to King Philip II.
I need 20 copies.
you got to be kidding me.
you're asking me to do the exact thing that you people locked me up for in the first place?
what is this, some kind of entrapment?
Stan... Stan, wait.
look, this is not a setup.
we are here because innocent people are getting killed.
you'll be helping us solve a murder case.
nobody's gonna arrest you for that.
and what'sn it for me?
you've got a brother up at Five Points Prison.
quite a ride on the thruway.
what do you say I move him downstate?
you can do that?
I can move Christmas.
I like this girl. - So, we have a deal?
after my brother's moved, you'll get your coins and not before.
and I want something in writing. - Done.
Hey, boss.
that's a $200, 000 piece of equipment.
any particular reason you're taking it apart?
well, it needed to be recalibrated.
I was running elimination DNA from the party guests, and then...
no results, nothing.
you sure it's the machine and not the quality of the reference sample?
we have several swabs from this specific subject, and none of them are producing any results.
whose is it? - Marina Melton.
she's Isabelle Vaughn's ex-business partner.
I took those reference samples myself. They should be fine.
well, if that's the case, then either the genetic analyzer is the problem or we just discovered the first human being without any DNA.
fix the machine.
what's up?
that bag of dirt that Hawkes found at Tony's apartment...
turned out to be elephant feces, consistent to what Sid found under Isabelle's nails.
so, that's how she came in contact with it.
somebody brought it to Tony's party.
maybe our killer.
fortunately, I was able to identify the vegetation in it.
that's because 50% of what elephants eat isn't digested.
you like that? It's Animal Planet.
right. So, after identifying multiple berries, leaves and flowers...
here, take a look. - I'm good, buddy.
I reached out to all the zoos in the tristate area and was able to match the vegetation to the Manhattan Zoo.
what, one of the zookeepers were at Tony's party?
no, but they do sell elephant dung to a guy named Colby Fisher, and according to the zoo, he makes recycled paper out of it.
and our man was on Tony Clark's guest list last night.
high five.
you left me hanging.
I meant it as a joke. I thought it would be funny.
tricking Isabelle into eating elephant crap-- it's hilarious.
why did you pick her?
I don't know. She was the first person I saw at the party.
it was a dumb move. I get it.
I just wanted to see if those ridiculous berries worked.
what is it? - Just try it.
Oh, Colby, you're such a jerk.
did you play any other pranks on her?
come on, Colby, after the Dumbo pie, what did you offer her to drink?
nothing. You got to understand, I would never have hurt Isabelle.
make us understand.
Isabelle and I were really tight. We...
we even hooked up a couple times.
how did that end?
it was no big deal. It was casual sex.
neither of us wanted anything long-term.
you two run in the same circles?
I used to make the hang tags for Isabelle's bags.
she wanted them made out of recycled paper.
you don't make them anymore? - No.
a couple months ago, she... she decided...
she decided to go with another company.
that must have pissed you off.
nobody likes losing business.
where is he going?
what are you doing with sodium hydroxide?
we use it to bleach our product. Is that a problem?
if it turns out to be the same sodium hydroxide used to kill Isabelle Vaughn, it is.
I've been over it three times.
whoever made this card was very careful not to leave any trace of themselves on it.
so, you're telling me we got nothing.
when I removed the materials used to make the card, I found a detailed sketch underneath, but that's it.
so, we can't tie it to any of Tony's party guests?
not unless Ella was a guest, because her prints are the only ones on it.
and the glue that she used to hang it in her apartment is the same glue used to make the card.
so, the only trace you have tracks back to Ella? - Yeah.
why, what are you thinking?
what is that?
it's Ella's statement from a couple of months ago.
she wrote it out when she was a suspect in her father's murder case.
take a look.
the circle on this sketch has the same loop at the top as her O.
you're doing a handwriting analysis on a sketch.
that's very outside the box.
she lifts her pen off the page to make her Vs, which explains the crisscross on the bottom.
the card's a fake.
I'm coming.
detective Taylor. This is a nice surprise.
why did you make that card?
what are you talking about?
enough with the games, Ella.
you bought one of Isabelle Vaughn's handbags, and you made that card yourself.
I know everything.
what is this, some twisted revenge to embarrass me for locking up your mother?
is that what this is about? - No. I would never do that.
a woman is dead.
instead of getting closer to her killer, I wasted valuable time chasing down a lie.
what were you thinking?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
that's not good enough.
I just needed someone to talk to.
we barely know each other, Ella. Why me?
I thought you cared about me.
the way you treated me when my father was murdered...
that didn't mean anything?
the other night... that wasn't a coincidence running into you, was it?
you think I was following you?
answer the question.
I-I just wanted to see you again.
I didn't actually think that you would take that stupid card so seriously.
I take every lead seriously. That's my job.
okay, I get it.
what I did was misguided and stupid.
can you forgive me?
you're lucky I don't arrest you.
everything okay? You seem a little stressed.
you damn right I am.
I don't understand why I'm here.
no? Why don't you think about the first time we all met.
and the answers you gave us.
my man, let me tell you a little something about my job.
you see, unlike my friend here who's all about science, I'm all about facts.
so let me lay a few on you.
fact: according to the phone company, for two months, you and your casual sex partner, Isabelle, talked nonstop.
fact: after two months, Isabelle stopped calling you, but you continued to reach out to her.
fact: your calls became so relentless that Isabelle was forced to block your number from her phone.
now, that would really piss off a guy who couldn't take no for an answer.
what was I supposed to tell you?
that I was a total jerk and I cheated on her?
why not?
that after she dumped me, I became obsessed with getting Isabelle back in my life?
you would've arrested me on the spot.
did you really think we wouldn't find out about this relationship?
I thought it wouldn't matter once you caught the person who killed her.
what? - Okay.
so tell us about the breakup.
Isabelle found out that I was sleeping with her business partner.
marina Melton. - Yes.
she came by to place an order one day, and things just got out of hand.
it stayed that way for a couple months.
then one day she says it's over.
and tells Isabelle what happened.
so Marina used you to hurt Isabelle.
that woman is diabolical.
only Isabelle wasn't the only one who got stung.
you got hurt also, didn't you?
I loved Isabelle. - Yeah, but after you cheated on her, Isabelle didn't feel the same way, and there was nothing you could do to change that.
so maybe you decided to hurt her.
no, you got it wrong.
you know what, save it, Colby, 'cause we tested the sodium hydroxide pellets from your paper plant, and they're and exact match to the pellets that killed Isabelle.
that's not possible.
science, facts...
Thanks. I'll get back to you.
what's up?
just got off the phone with the Chief's office.
they're asking why someone in the Crime Lab is moving a career criminal named Marty Trovato from Five Points to Downstate prison.
I didn't have an answer.
I wanted to keep you out of this, Mac.
that's not the answer I was looking for.
his brother, Stan, is helping me.
you mean Stan Trovato?
convicted felon, parolee, forger of all things currency.
not exactly the cornerstone of a solid case.
look, I was going to tell you all about this.
I just needed... - Stop, stop right there.
I don't want to know.
whatever you're doing stops today, right now.
Sebastian Diakos has killed two people and I don't think he's finished.
the guy's taunting me, Mac.
he sent me a dead rat as a message.
put yourself in my shoes.
try stepping into mine.
I admire your passion, Stella, but what you did is reckless.
and more importantly, it could compromise any future criminal prosecution.
what I'm doing is perfectly legal.
and contrary to the policies of this lab and this department.
major Case is working the Diakos investigation.
if they need us, they'll call.
in the meantime, you need to stand down.
you can't ask me to do that, Mac.
come on, I can get this guy. I just need...
give me a couple of days.
as your friend, I would love to, but this is me being your boss.
I'm not asking. It's a direct order.
fine.
so Colby Fisher just lawyered up.
you think he did it? - I don't know.
I mean, we matched the trace impurities from his sample with the sodium hydroxide that was used to kill Isabelle.
it's pretty damning, but I don't know if it's enough to take to the DA.
just figured out why we couldn't get any DNA off Marina Melton's buccal swabs.
you mean the genetic analyzer wasn't broken?
when I processed the blender with the sodium hydroxide in it,
I found small flakes from a leaf called betel quid.
now, betel quid is a mild stimulant.
people chew on it to get a boost.
but when they do, it isolates the DNA from their saliva, making it appear as if the donor has no DNA.
look at this.
betel quid is primarily used by people from southeast Asia.
detectives, I came here from Thailand eight years ago with nothing.
Marina's from Thailand.
Yeah, so perhaps the flakes fell in when she was spiking Isabelle's drink.
so we got trace that puts Marina on the blender that was used to make the drink that killed Isabelle.
and we got motive. The two of them were at war.
and when she was was hooking up with Colby, she also had access to the sodium hydroxide from the paper plant.
bring her in.
Isabelle was on her way to becoming a household name.
I had everything to gain.
why would I want her dead?
are you done? - Excuse me?
when you were picked up, my officers found this snuff box in your purse.
my lab took a look at it and they found traces of betel quid inside.
I keep betel leafs in that box. That's not illegal.
I wasn't finished.
they also found trace elements of pure sodium hydroxide, which you had access to all those weeks that you were playing your little seduction game with Colby Fisher.
is that what he told you? And you believe him?
I believe the evidence, and here's what it's telling me:
you stole sodium hydroxide pellets from Colby's paper plant and you brought it to the party inside this snuff box.
you killed Isabelle Vaughn.
so maybe this wasn't about the money.
you said it yourself.
Isabelle worked for you.
you already own the label and all her designs.
I think you didn't like Isabelle standing up to you.
you took advantage of her, preyed on her talents, her dreams, and then when she decided to stand up for herself, you put her down.
Isabelle Vaughn was an ungrateful, little bitch.
after all I did for her, she thought she could just walk away.
but we had a contract.
and it was legally binding.
so is a murder conviction.
can I help you? - George Kolovos?
that's right.
you work for the Greek government.
do I know you?
no, but you're going to want to.
where did you get this?
all you need to know is there's more where that came from.
I already know that, because they belong to my country.
not at the moment. - Who are you?
it doesn't matter.
you're playing a very dangerous game. You know that, right?
if you're not interested, I'll take my business elsewhere.
wait.
what do you want?
I'll be in touch.
how'd it go? - He took the bait.
great. Let's hope he leads us to Diakos.
who's this?
I'm, I'm sorry.
sometimes it hurts so much and I just...
just want to make it go away.
Ella, what have you done?
I just want you to know how sorry I am.
I'm so tired of being alone.
I have to get you up. Come on. Get up. Come on.
here, here.
it's not deep. You didn't cut the arteries. Sit down.
I messed up.
it's all right. It's okay.
I ruined everything. Sorry.
I'm going to take you to the hospital, okay? All right.
I'm so sorry.
I'm going to take care of you.
everything's going to be all right. Come on. It's going to be all right.
I WILL MAKE HIM LOVE ME
Hey, what are yo you want everyone to think you're a tourist?
come on. We don't have much time. They're picking us up in, like, 20 minutes.
Oh, sorry!
Oh, we have to get a picture. Come on. Come on. Come on. okay.
I hope you saved the receipt to that sweatshirt.
do you want a piece of gum
Oh, they're here. Okay.
there you go.
looks like a straight-up robbery-homicide.
ID'ing him might be another story.
no witnesses, no wallet, no cell phone, no jewelry.
I have a theory about these "it's the big apple" shirts.
there's a direct correlation between the number of miles one lives away from the city and the probability that they'd actually wear it.
wherever he's from, I don't think this is the "welcome to new york" he had in mind.
weatherman says there's more on the way.
anything that didn't get soggy?
very little.
looks like he fought with his attacker.
I don't see any defensive wounds from the blade, almost as if he wasn't expecting it.
well, it's hard to miss a knife coming right at you.
there's a surgical incision here on his throat, consistent with some type of thyroid surgery.
as well as evidence of cataracts being removed from his cornea.
I used to see this occasionally when I performed an autopsy.
mac, check for pigmentation of his fingertips.
got several dark stripes along the length of the nail.
Melanonychia striata.
a relt of chemotherapy.
chemotherapy and the surgical incision near the neck suggest thyroid cancer.
add cataracts.
both are symptoms of past exposure to high levels of radiation.
and it looks like there's acrylic dental work, which confirms he's not from this country.
professional guess? There's a good chance our vic is from the ukraine.
eastern europe.
chernobyl, 1986.
explains the radiation.
puts him a long way from home.
looks like my big apple shirt theory holds up.
let's hope the evidence does.
when I was a kid, I bugged the heckut of my mother to buy me one of those stupid shirts.
eventually, she caved in.
that's a great story, danny.
well, I'm not finished, wise guy.
see, that shirt wasn't so popular at ps 21 in staten island, so the first day I wore it, got in two fights.
first one-- I won that one, yeah.
second one, I'd say was a draw.
got detention, never wore that shirt again.
so what, you think this was the same guys?
it's kind of what I'm thinking.
looks like I got some kind of trace here.
I'm perplexed ov here.
looks like coffee.
Yeah, well, whatever it is, the spill pattern should have left a stain on the sweatshirt as well.
but there's nothing there.
St cuts off at the waistband of his jeans and boxers.
this looks brand-new.
maybe he spilled the coffee and then changed his shirt.
you can buy one of these things almost anywhere.
like in an a port.
this is a sticker from a salt shaker.
most airlines use them in first class.
I'm more of a coach guy. Pretzels, nuts. Salt's included.
this guy doesn't strike me as first class material.
well, he didn't have to be. Secondary transfer.
he could have picked this up walking through first class when he exited the plane.
and I can't imagine that these cling to fabric for very long, so this must have been recent.
Danny, I bet this guy just entered the country.
may be a long shot, but we could get an id from a passenger manifest.
I'll call flack. - Great.
have him start with all flights that arrived from eastern europe within the last 24 hours.
if our vic went through customs, he had to go by security cameras.
and see if anybody's reported a relative missing.
also, check any hotels that didn't get a cancellation call.
is that it? - Yeah.
you sure? - I got it.
the knife I pulled from our vic's chest is used for pruning plants and flowers.
Danny found fibers on the hilt. Same as those I found in the wound.
I identified them as plum blossom.
okay, so where do we find plum blossoms in the dead of winter in new york, sid?
canal street.
I did a little research. They're all over chinatown this time of year.
used for decoration in celebration of chinese new year.
happy new year" in chinese.
year of the ox. - Oh, yeah.
and I th k I have a pretty good idea who the knife belongs to.
the uv reactive metal that sid found in our victim's knuckle waa broken piece of a lip ring.
it's possible our vic punched his attacker in the mouth, causing the ng to break off and become embedded in his knuckle.
now, normally, because there was very little blood, it would have been difficult to get a usable profile of the person who wore the ring, but fortunately for us, piercings, especially new ones, are often rejected by the body.
white blood cells rush to the area of the piercing to fight off the foreign object.
and as you know, those germ fighters are the ones that carry dna.
which enabled me to get a usable profile of the person who wore the ring.
you two are quite the tag team.
Oh, yeah.
Sammy chen, career criminal.
so now we find him.
they took their last three collars together.
both these morons just finished a one-to-three bid for robbery.
now they're working 9: 00-to-5: 00s at's market.
minimum wage labor, huh? - Yeah, I know.
it's a condition of their parole.
Dan, 11 o'clock.
NYPD! Put the knife down!
excuse me. Get out of the way! Get out of the way!
put the knife down!
drop the knife! Drop the knife now!
get back in the house, kid!
let me out!
I can't breathe in here! Hello?
I'm on the phone here.
stay down! Show me your hands!
you good? - yeah, I'm fine.
the suit ain't doing so hot though.
I'll go grab the car, swing by and pick you up.
all right.
Oh, yeah, and just so you know, I stink.
Hello?
shut up!
you messed up my favorite suit.
so, I'll give you the 49 bucks to go buy another one.
I have something that belongs to you.
it has your dna on it.
that fancy little lip ring is gonna buy youife, sammy boy.
life for what? A robbery?
how about murder? - Murder?
Yep, unless he made a miraculous recovery at the morgue, he looks pretty dead to me.
that wasn't us.
the pruning knife in his chest is exactly the same as the one you dropped in front of the store.
that and the fact that your lip ring was embedded in his knuckle sounds like a pretty solid case to me.
we didn't do it" isn't gonna cut it, sammy.
so, unless you give us something else, we're gonna run with the evidence we have and you can go back to your cell.
well, I like our chances at trial.
okay, wait. Look...
you have to believe me, we didn't kill that guy.
we were only gonna rob him.
no, sammy held the knife to his throat and I took his wallet.
he's got rubles, russiaitcred cards. He's got nothing!
go! Go!
we didn't even get anything.
I threw the wallet on top of an awning around the corner.
then what? He stabbed himself in the chest after you guys ran away?
no, when we took o, he was alive with this knife in his hand.
right where she said it would be.
Hey, what's up?
I don't know. Russian driver's cense.
good luck trying to make heads or tails of that.
Yeah, it's never easy.
why couldn't this be in the dry half of the wallet?
I take that back. Maybe it could be that easy.
looks like a meeting was arranged.
I got a day, time, place. Looks like whitford.
no way we'll make it there through rush hour traffic.
I'll call mac.
deputy inspector whitford?
Hey, pleasant coincidence.
I'm not sure it is.
are you waiting for a man named adrik fedoruk?
Yeah, you showing off your exceptional detective skills?
he won't be coming.
how do you know that?
he was murdered last night.
there was a note inside his wallet that said to be here at this time.
your name was on it.
Yeah, we made the appointment a week ago 'cause he was coming to new york.
Gillian, I have to ask. Was this personal?
no, business. His daughter disappeared.
she came in from the ukraine about a month ago.
she was promised some kind of a modeling job, and he hadn't heard from her since.
Rani. That was her name.
missing persons involved?
she was one of those people who falls through the cracks.
language barrier, a lack of information as to where she was, who she was with.
there wasn't enough to open a case.
no, he got very frustrated.
after dozens of phone calls and no one helping, he wrote a very moving letter to the mayor.
it ended up on my desk and I took a personal interest.
did he send her picture?
if he did, it didn't get to me.
did mr. Fedoruk say where he was going, or if he was meeting someone else?
no, just that he was gonna come for as long as necessary and do whatever it took to find his daughter.
looks like it took his life.
I believe this is a letter from adrik fedoruk's daughter.
the language is ukrainian and the alphabet cyrillic.
I had it translated.
I'm sorry. Not right here. "Can get me. Bright lights.
possibly, come and get me. And here.
this word could mean some form of "fast "or "hurry.
the letter was damaged quite badly by the rain.
our translator made a best guess as to what might have been written, but it sounds like a plea for help.
adrik didn't just come to find his daughter.
he came to rescue her. - Yeah.
he told me that he hadn't heard from her.
so, he got this letter in the last week.
actually, it was postmarked fourays ago.
Danny found it on the envelope with esda.
so, he received this letter after he wrote to the mayo and made a phone call to you.
d we get a zip code? A city?
it was unreadable.
unfortunately, there was nothing to indicate where she was.
bright lights? That'every other corner in manhattan.
Yeah, and i couldn't recover an address or a location from the body of that letter.
found this in our vic's suitcase.
it's probably rani. - You found his luggage?
Yeah. There was a pile of unclaimed bags at kennedy airport that originated in the ukraine, which didn't arrive till this morning.
that must be why he had the sweatshirt.
he didn't have any clothes.
mac, some of the bags had tags. But we didn't have e vic's name at the time.
Lindsay matched the vic's prints with several partials she lifted from the handles and straps.
anything else in the bags?
two tickets home.
one for himself, the other made out to a rani fedoruk.
whoever rani is, she's waiting for her dad.
she has no idea he's dead.
Oh, thank you.
look at that.
isn't that the most amazing thing you've ever seen?
thank you. - You're welcome.
cheers to you in new york city.
okay, I'll be right back. Stay here, okay? - Okay.
Hey, I think I got something:
the dna from the seal on the envelope was a familial match to adrik.
makes sense. Daughter wrote the letter. Daughter sealed the envelope.
Yeah, but I'm not so sure she mailed it.
see, the dna on the back of the stamp was from someone else.
someone in our database.
our friend, willie burton.
I mail a lot of letters.
for other people?
17-year-old girls?
Willie, she was in your nightclub.
I'm supposed to know her?
you know how many women I see coming out my place of business in a day?
okay, let me be more specific.
how many stamps do you lick a week?
you as tough as you are beautiful?
you put a stamp on an envelope of a letter this young girl wrote to her father in the ukraine.
it's dna, willie. It doesn't lie.
I ain't lying neither. I don't remember her face.
okay, yeah, I seem to remember a private party at my club.
it was a bachelor party.
when was this?
three weeks, maybe a month ago.
I know it was a friday 'cause a bunch of young ladies came in with the guest, and one of them asked me if i would trade a kiss for a favor.
and you don't remember her face?
I'm lucky that way. I kiss a lot of women.
Yeah, I bet you do.
who threw the party? - Don't know.
what's this about? Since when did mailing a letter become a crime?
this young girl's father was murdered.
we need to find her.
Scout's honor, all right.
I can't help you.
excuse me.
you look like you're on to something, but... not quite.
not a bad deduction, doc.
I'm staring at a dead end.
Willie burton gave me nothing, but I did find a glove print under the armpit of our vic's sweatshirt.
right here.
it was protected from the rain.
Yes, so I swabbed it for trace. It's running through gcms.
what's confusing is the placement of the hand.
it's incoistent with the struggle described by sun and chen, and their fingerprints are all over our vic'lls waet, so we know they weren't wearing gloves.
what about the victim's own hand?
he wasn't wearing gloves when we found him. Doesn't mean he didn'T.
no, it would be extremely awkward for him to execute it himself.
it's his right hand under the right armpit, thumb in the front.
it's as if someone came up to him. They had to get close.
it's not an aggressive or threatening action.
there were no defensive wounds from the knife. - Right.
it's like like you said earlier:
it's as if..." he wasn't expecting it.
I mean, who'd expect to get stabbed by someone who appeared to be your friend?
especially someone who may have been trying to helping you.
are you all ri t?
the glove print could have been the killer'S.
he didn't fight back 'cause he didn't get a chance to.
trace from the glove print: Turmeric, paprika, sodium.
reads like a recipe until you get to the aluminum oxide and calcium sulfate hemihydrate.
aluminum oxide is rust.
calcium sulfate hemihydrate could be cement or plaster.
rusty pipes in walls?
turmeric is yellow in coloring, used in cooking.
obviously, rust indicates something old and unkept.
plaster leads me to some type of exposed building structure.
so, we got vinegar, salts, turmeric.
I'm no cook, but I think we just made mustard.
that old mustard warehouse in williamsburg is abandoned.
well, maybe not.
rani, move! Come on! Move!
go, hurry, go! Go!
it's all clear.
this is a sex trafficking location, stella.
get out from under the bed now! Get out!
okay, don't hurt me. Don't hurt me.
look, I just came here to sleep.
was anyone here with you?
no, I just found this place.
I thought it looked like a good place to crash.
there wasn't anyone here when I got here.
Katie, where do you live? Where's your family?
I don't ve one. I mean, they don't care.
do you know this girl? Have you seen her? Her name is rani fedoruk.
no... I just came here to sleep.
am I allowed to, um, go to the bathroom?
sure.
she is not telling the truth.
she's terrified.
she should be.
you know, about an hour ago, this place was probabl filled with at least 30 young girls just like from all over.
eastern europe... latin america... even the us.
they all left home with big dreams, and now they're living a very real nightmare as sex slaves.
they're being beaten, drugged, who knows what else.
somehow, their handlers got a heads-up we were coming and they were moved.
looks like katie got lost in the shuffle and left behind.
she's not talking.
Oh, she's too afraid right now. You got to gain her trust.
rani has to be among the girls who were moved.
adrik must have gotten close. Too close.
in that case, do we still think rani's alive?
rani's a commodity. She's alive.
it's locked.
Katie, katie, are you okay?
Katie, we're coming in.
she's gone.
all units to the back of the building.
we're looking for a young girl, long brown hair, 5'6."
you hear from flack? - They haven't found katie yet.
what have we found, lindsay?
pigment granules on the majority of the hairs that hawkes collecte at the scene are densely packed, so I can safely draw the conclusion that most of the girls held captive in that room were between the ages of 14 and 21.
there is one tiny bit of good news:
there was a match inhe fbi database to a dna sample of a missing girl.
a father looking for his daughter.
at least he'll know she's alive.
but she's still missing.
what kind of heartache is that?
all those people wondering where their children are.
well, maybe this can help. The girls are being drugged.
tox results on the hair indicate large quantities of heroin.
we detect a specific combination of excipients?
Yeah, heroin laced with ecstasy and codeine.
unique combination of narcotics.
they get them high, then later depress them.
make them passive, so they can't fight back.
suppress their appetite, so they don't have to feed them much.
the ecstasy makes them thirsty.
they want more water, which is probably laced with yet another drug.
this blend of drugs is a signature to one specific distributor.
his street name is nem
and willie burton can help us set him up.
here's the brand, willie.
there's only one distributor out there who uses this logo.
we want to pair you up with an undercover, have you hook up with the seller...
I'm not interested, man.
would you be interested in your club being shut down for employing underage girls as adult entertainment?
that girl you mailed the letter for was 17, willie.
you want me to start listing the charges?
I don't mess with narcotics, man.
well, you used to, and the guys who sent those girls to your club-- they definitely do.
I got nothing to do with those guys.
Yes, you do, willie.
somebody brought a group of underage girls into your club, drugged them, forced them to have sex with I don't know how many men, I don't know how many times.
that didn't happen in my establishment.
I don't provide women for sexual services, and I definitely don't treat them that way.
you're disrespecting me.
and you're disrespecting my mother 'cause she taught me better than that.
my apologies to your mother.
but the only definite connection I have to any of this is your saliva on the back of a stamp.
just get us there. We'll do the rest. I'll owe you.
and from what I know of your club, a day's gonna come when you need to call in that favor.
I ain't doing it for you.
I'm doing it for that girl that gave me that letter.
no undercovers. No wires.
we do this my way.
I'm not comfortable authorizing this.
he'll get us to the dealers who are selling drugs to whoever is holding those girls captive.
how do you know you can trust him?
I trust flack.
I worked narcotics for seven years.
the same people who traffic in drugs traffic in weapons, traffic in people.
that world is very connected, and it's very savvy.
and dangerous and risky, but this is the best option that we have right now.
your informant is making all the rules.
this could be our only shot at getting to these girls before they're moved to another cit or another country.
we send in an undercover, or we don't go in at all.
I'm gonna be honest here. I'm not used to being second-guessed.
it just feels like the wrong way to an arrest.
don't take it personally.
is this about something else?
this is about not risking the lives of those young girls.
your drug buy goes bad, we lose our best lead to where they're being hd.
just yesterday, we had nothing.
we're not so deep into this that we can't recover.
a man lost his life looking for his daughter.
I want to find her. - We will.
I want to find her alive.
I made a promise. I'd like to keep it.
fedoruk's letter didn't accidentally land on your desk.
let's just be honest here, gillian. What's going on?
three years ago, my niece, rachel, went missing.
beautiful young girl. 14...
she's really smart, and she wants to be a dancer, and her parents don't approve.
they have some problems, and then she just disappears.
I didn't just lose her. My broth, her dad...
well, he's no longer the loving, gregarious, charming man he used to be.
she meant everything to him.
and I miss him.
I miss them both.
you know when rachel first went missing, we did everything.
I, I didn't take a cab or a bus or the train in the city.
I'd walk, I'd walk, and I'd look in every face of every young girl that passed me just hoping, expecting to see her.
and then I stopped.
I knew that if we hadn't found her in a month, never mind a year, she was somewhere else.
she could be anywhere.
you believe she is alive?
Oh, I don't know.
do what you have to.
no I don't have an appointment, okay.
and no one is expecting me, okay, but, but my daughter's alive.
sir, sir, calm down. - Okay, they... look, look. They know where she is.
and I, I just want to talk... I just want... listen, I just want I got it. Alk to tto someone.
no I need to talk to someone. - Sir.
the fbi-- they said the dna was a match, all right.
sir, I need you to calm downokay. How can I help you?
my daughter was missing.
they know where she is. She's alive. Okay?
and I, uh, I just want to find her.
there was a match in the fbi database to a dnaample of a missing girl.
okay. Okay I understand. We will.
we'll find her.
she was with this girl.
Carolyn, I think her name was.
they met when they both were attending georgetown university.
and then they decided to move to los angeles to, uh, pursue a career in acting.
I had no idea they'd end up here in new york.
she had a thinner face. Carolyn had a-a thinner face.
dark brown hair. Dark brown eyes.
no, that's too dark.
Yeah, that's closer.
She-she met my-my daughter, tara on, uh, the subway commute.
they bame friends.
she said her parents, uh, lived in los angeles, and...
approved of her dropping out of school and going back home.
I'm, uh, I'm a single father.
I, uh...
I been overprotective tara's whole life.
I just, uh, wanted to trust her.
I just wanted to, uh... believe in her.
she wanted to do this thing so badly.
I should have asked more questions.
I should have, uh, gotten more information.
she was gone two weeks.
what made you believe that something went wrong?
she didn't call me after the second day.
I tried her cell. It just...
just kept ringing.
no, uh, no voicemail.
then she left a message that she lost her phone.
you didn't believe her.
Tara would find a way to call me.
and that-that'S... that's when I called the dc police and...
gave the fbi one of her baby teeth.
it still had blood on it.
that's tara.
she's beautiful. - Yeah.
nemo, what's up?
how you livin', man? How you livin'? How you livin'?
how you been? - Baby, I'm always good. And yourself?
Ah, been a minute.
too long, baby. Too long. Too long. Too long.
Yeah. Good though.
always, man. Always.
I gotta get up out of here, though. - All right, all right.
but we catch up later? - Definitely. Definitely.
Freeze! Get your hands up! Up against the wall!
Hey, hey, relax, relax, relax.
come on, man. Relax.
nice work.
never seen it before, N.
Willie was selling to me. And I sa nO.
is that why you had a wad of cash in your pocket?
I don't trust banks.
it's your signature, nemo all right, it's your stuff.
all right, if I have to, I'll find your fingerprints in it.
listen to me.
you sell a large quantity of thistuff to a sex trafficking ring.
now you can either tell us who and where they are or we're happy enough to call it a day and lock you up for everything and anything you can possibly think of.
that's wrong, man.
I wouldn't mess with him. He wants to make the rangers game tonight.
you want to tell me. I know you want to tell me.
all right.
look out! Move!
or I'll shoot you.
quickly now. This way, ladies, come on.
that's tara.
you see this girl?
sorry, my friend. Never seen her before.
uh, you... you're sure? This is address.
I wish I could help you. Sorry. - But she'S...
are you all right?
they tried to mug me.
he got your letter and he came to find you.
I want you to know that.
they killed him because I tried to escape.
no, no. Rani, that's not true.
he asked the wrong questions to the wrong people.
his greatest desire was to have you safe.
you understand? Safe.
daddy, I'm okay.
you found me.
I knew you'd come.
you knew I could count on you.
so many other girls are safe, too, because of you.
daddy, I'm okay. I'm right here.
I love you.
I love you. I love you. I love you.
no, she had, uh, full l S. A little more. Like that, but... yeah.
that's right.
daddy?
I'm sorry. I'm so, so, sorry. I know I've disappointed you.
no never, tara. Never. You could never disappoint me, baby. Never.
baby, never, never, never.
that's her! She did it.
she's the one who lied to me. I trusted her. And that's her!
the whole thing was a lie.
Carolyn is katie.
welcome to new york city!
isn't this so exciting?
okay, so we don't have too much time.
they're gonna be here in like half an hour. So...
Oh, they're here. Okay. Let's go.
Hello, katie... or is it carolyn?
you said your name was lisa.
not this time.
what's going on?
it's okay. It's okay. Just stay put.
turn around.
get in the car. - Am I in trouble?
I'll explain everything. No, you're fine.
Oh, you liked that, didn't you?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you thought your boyfriend was gonna score, didn't you?
but he's not goinon this...
uh, car!
Hey, can you get that?
that's okay, I'll just...
Thanks.
I got it!
Hey, are you okay, buddy?
dude, look at me.
dude, just stop walking for a second, all right?
Hey, can you hear me?
are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine, man.
that van almost creamed you!
help! Help!
you hear that?
help me, help me!
somebody's in there.
Hello?! - I'm over here!
can you hear me?!
Yeah! I'm over here, help!
somebody get some help!
where are you? Keep talking!
I'm over here!
Where?!
I'm back here!
my leg, my leg, I can't...
where are you?
over here, please!
I'm...I'm trapped here!
what's your name? - Felix.
Felix, Felix, you're gonna be okay.
okay.
just lean on me.
it's gonna be all right.
keep walking. Keep walking.
Hey, you guys all right?
here, take him.
you get him.
this your house?
uh, yeah.
there anyone else in there?
no, no, I was the only one home.
all right, take him, go.
Hawkes, go with him.
I'm on it.
Adam, sit down, sit down.
let me see you.
it's not as bad as it looks.
tell me what happened.
I was playing hockey and all of a sudden, I-I don't know.
did you see anyone leave the van?
uh, no, I... I had my back turned to it the whole time.
did you hear anyone shout anything before it exploded?
anything at all?
I mean, there was, there were people that were...
were screaming during the game, but...
all of a sudden, the...the van, it was, it just, it flew right...
all right. All right, take it easy, take a breath.
can we get a medic over here?!
let's hook him up to a monitor and give him some oxygen.
sir, my name is Dr. Sheldon Hawkes.
I'm a crime scene investigator.
just wanna ask you a few questions,
uh, yeah, all right.
what's your name, sir?
it's Felix Redman.
now, is this your house, sir?
was my house, yeah.
what about the white van that was parked out front?
uh, it's not mine.
you know who it belongs to?
no, I don't remember ever seeing it on the block, but listen, can you tell me what the hell happened?
cause one second I was up in my bedom.
the next thing I know the floor gives, the whole house comes down on me.
Mr. Redman, I promise you, I'm gonna figure that out.
what about your wife, sir, where is she?
Yeah, she's, uh, visiting her parents in Lake Okoboji, thank God.
bet you never thought you'd be thankful for in-laws, huh?
all right, well, I'll get back to you as soon as I know more.
you got it.
detective Flack.
agent Frank Richardson.
I want you to know our resources are at your disposal.
is that right?
I appreciate your skepticism, Detective, but with a car bomb like this, we have to act quickly.
I agree.
I got officers taking statements from witnesses and canvassing the houses to see if anyone's got a connection to the van.
I'll keep you informed on any intelligence we gather.
works for me.
Hey, buddy, do me a favor and go back inside, okay?
we got enough crime shows, I think.
neighbor found this on her front lawn about a block and a half away.
we're not dealing with a Molotov cocktail in the gas tank.
this is high-grade stuff.
ammonium nitrate.
used in agriculture as a high-nitrogen fertilizer.
in the wrong hands, it's an oxidizing agent in explosives.
mcveigh used it in the Oklahoma City bombing.
douchebag.
this guy wasn't fooling around.
no license plates recovered yet, and the public VIN number's been removed.
covering his tracks.
now, if the witnesses didn't see anyone leave or approach the car, then it could've been detonated remotely or with a timer.
we might be able to find the trigger device somewhere in all this debris.
looks like part of a metal drum.
could've been used to house the ammonium nitrate.
this fragment is big enough to estimate a radius of 12 inches.
you two are gonna talk Chinese now, right?
circumference equals two PI*R.
two times 3. 14 times 12.
approximately 72 inches.
consistent with a 30-gallon drum.
Yeah, well, we've got fragments for at least two drums.
one blue, one red.
five 50-pound bags of ammonium nitrate per drum.
we're looking at a 500-pound bomb.
you going out to the scene?
Yeah, between the van and the house we're gonna be out there all day.
you think they need another hand?
you kidding me? No, you're not going out there.
it's my last case before I go home.
I just want to be useful.
Ah, well, between the fumes from the blast and the dust from the house it's too risky.
besides, you're gonna have plenty to do when we bring half the crime scene back here.
I know.
so...
you excited about going to Montana?
Yeah, yeah, I'm excited to see my mom.
I want her to see me pregnant.
you know, I mean, it's gotta be really cool to see your daughter pregnant.
if this is a girl, I'm already looking forward to that.
Yeah.
if this is a girl, no guy's getting close enough to her to get her pregnant.
how's Adam?
well, he's a bit shaken up, but he'll be okay.
what about the owner of the house?
says he doesn't know anything about the van.
guy shouldn't even be alive.
the house collapses on him, and he walks away with minor scrapes and bruises.
in 1970 the Weathermen were using a townhouse in the Vilge as a bomb factory.
bomb went off accidentally, took the whole place down.
two of their members who were inside walked away.
weren't found for ten yes.
Yeah, well, this Felix Redman's no Weatherman.
he owns an electronics recycling company, and he hasn't received even as much as a parking ticket-- squeaky clean.
no, this bomb was designed to cause multiple fatalities.
is there a parade or a fair scheduled on this block in the next few days?
the bomb may have gone off prematurely.
I'll look into it.
I'm gonna take the van.
Hawkes? Grid the street, document the debris.
every scrap of metal's significant.
Danny's on his way. He and I'll head into the rubble.
force of the blast may have blown some fragments back into the house.
Yeah, I'm on it.
I thought no one else was home.
C. O.D. is high-velocity impact resulting in a severed spinal cord.
so, how's it feel?
it's your last case, right?
then off to Montana.
it feels pretty good.
Oh, I bet it does.
no bodies at 3: 00 a. m. No double shifts with no sleep, a slice of pizza on the run.
constipation, swelling of the feet, help getting up from a chair, constant urination.
want to switch?
I already have all that.
I just want the time off.
is there any chance that she could have been walking by the van and been blown into the house?
I pulled traces of brick from her head wound.
she was definitely inside the house.
owner said he was alone.
you got anything else?
I realize this is usually the part where I tell you that I found some strange, unusual, bizarre, aberrant, peculiar, idiosyncratic...
that's it, I don't have any more synonyms for "strange.
wait-- weird-- weird piece of evidence.
but, alas, there's no Gila monster in her stomach.
she simply succumbed to the bomb.
the strange part is, who is she, and what was she doing in the house?
Oh, God, no.
Mr. Redman?
God, no. She, she wasn't home. She...
who wasn't home?
my little girl!
he never mentioned his daughter because she goes to school upstate.
he says he doesn't know why she was in the city and swears he didn't know she was home.
based on his reaction, I believe him.
where are we on the evidence from the scene?
well, Lindsay and Hawkes have their hands full.
they're looking at the pipe bomb fragments and debris from the van.
you heard from Flack?
Yeah.
there were no street fairs, or markets scheduled on the street for at least a month.
Thanks.
Maybe...someone in the neighborhood rigged the van with explosives and the plan was to drive it to the intended target.
and the plan derailed when the bomb went off accidentally.
makes sense.
you don't need a 500-pound bomb if you're just waiting for someone to pass by at that location.
you think we're dealing with a terrorist cell?
if we are, we're looking at multiple actors.
someone rents the van, someone steals the nitromethane, someone buys the pipes.
sometimes the leader doesn't even tell 'em the intended target.
so we may be chasing more than one person.
but why detonate the bomb there?
come take a look at this.
I'm telling you, Linds, this kind of tedious work makes me appreciate Adam just that much more.
what's up?
you see those marks on the center of the pipe bomb?
Yeah. They look patterned, inconsistent with the damage from the blast.
I found the exact same marks on this piece of pipe.
they look identical.
manufacturer defect?
maybe.
well, if you can track it to a manufacturer, might be able to get a lot number and a specific store.
it's worth a shot.
you making any progress?
well, some things are starting to take shape.
I just don't know what shape that is.
thankfully, our bombers are cheap.
they're never willing to blow up their own vehicles.
they use rentals.
Ramzi Yousef rented a Ryder truck in the '93 Trade Center bombing,
mcveigh did the same for Oklahoma City.
and our guy used Classico Rentals.
he was smart enough to remove all the VIN numbers, but he forgot about this little bad boy.
GPS locator the company keeps in all their cars.
were you able to trace the route of the van?
this is too damaged, but I managed to get a specific rental location and the guy who rented it.
his name is Michael Elgers.
his date of birth is 4/18/83.
so much for making yourself look inconspicuous.
assault as a hate crime, assault as a hate crime, aggravated assault as a hate crime.
just your average, neighborhood neo-Nazi.
it's guys like Michael Elgers that confi my stance on the death penalty.
his last arrest was for reckless endangerment.
Francis Lewis Boulevard in Queens.
could be for drag racing, right?
well, if it is, he got access to nitromethane.
it's used as racing fuel.
there's a synagogue down the street from the crime scene.
maybe Elgers is looking to spread his hate around.
your mother must be very proud.
who do you think gave me half of these tattoos?
white Pride.
did you ever hear the phrase "Swallow your pride"?
what do you want, pig?
good talk.
so who was the bomb meant for, Michael?
the Japs.
I'm really not in the mood, man.
there was a girl in that house, did you know that?
Yeah, your whacked - out plan went south and you blew up an innocent girl.
I didn't blow up nothing, how many times do I gotta tell you?
you meant to hit the synagogue on the corner, didn't you?
do I really have to listen to this crap?
indulge me, Mr. Elgers, then I'll let you get back to your beer and your racism.
you realize you could face the death penalty here?
okay.
let me paint a picture for you.
here's a little taste of what the jury's gonna hear.
you rented a van, created a bomb consisting of nitromethane, which we know you have access to as a convicted drag racer, and the bomb was down the block from a synagogue.
which is significant, you see, because you're a neo-Nazi.
I'm not giving you a statement.
you really think I'm that stupid?
you were stupid enough to rent a van in your own name.
what?
paperwork.
you filled out the forms.
or did your mother do that for you, too?
this is messed-up, man.
what are you guys trying to do?
that's not my signature.
how's your pride now?
I want a lawyer.
you got it.
the girl that got killed, was she white or black?
she's dead.
Hey, what's up with Michael Elgers?
we're getting handwriting samples right now.
based on what I heard from Flack, I'm glad I wasn't in the room.
so Elgers looks good for it, but we still don't have a target.
digital watch?
Yeah.
blew into the engine.
looks like our perp used it as the trigger.
now, according to the witnesses, the bomb went off at exactly 2: 00 p. m.
if a specific time was set, it suggests the bomb didn't go off accidentally.
come here and take a look.
you see these burn patterns?
directionality is inconsistent with them having resulted from the blast.
arc welding with exposed burn marks.
these steel plates weren't part of the van.
they were welded on to reinforce the sides so the bomb would take the path of least resistance.
and force the blast to exit this way.
500 pounds of explosives, plus directionality.
Felix Redman's house was the target.
appreciate that
Mr. Redman...
you have a minute?
detective Bonasera.
how are you holding up?
not so good.
I'm still trying to make sense of it all.
figure out what Alison was doing at the house.
I thought maybe coming to work would force me to think about something other than my daughter, but...
well, you've got quite an operation here.
Oh, yeah, yeah, it's e-waste.
the fastest-growing trash in America.
four and a half billion pounds of electronic waste every year.
we throw away 130, 000 computers every day.
over a million cell phones.
Mr. Redman, I realize you have a lot on your mind right now.
I-I've came down here because we've come to a disturbing conclusion.
it appears the bombers were targeting you.
what?
the blast was intentionally directed at your house.
are you serious? Why? I...
I was hoping that you might be able to help me with that.
what, do I know someone who would want to blow up my house with a car bomb?
are you kidding me?
your business just signed a contract with the city, correct?
Yeah, yeah. They awarded us the contract last month.
uh, my company handles all, uh, electronic waste from government facilities.
that's a big contract.
do you think one of your competitors could've done something like this?
that's kind-kind of crazy, don't you think?
it's...
Mr. Redman, again, I'm so sorry for your loss.
if there's anything you need, you just give me a call, okay?
Yeah, I will do that.
thank you.
hang in there.
what up?
you didn't think I was gonna let you assemble this by yourself, did you?
Mr. Hero, himself.
I wouldn't go that far.
Unless...Well, okay, yeah, you can...you can go that far.
did they grill you?
FBI, ATF, Homeland Security, our department.
I had to recreate this story over a dozen times.
and some othe ys were acting like I had something to do with it.
did you?
I'm just messing with you, man.
I'm glad you're all right.
Oh, thanks.
so, what can I do to help catch the guy that almost killed New York's most eligible bachelor?
now that you say that, uh...
daughter's clothes.
mac needs me in the conference room.
welcome back.
love you, brother.
Thanks.
it's good to be back.
this was two years ago at an animal research lab on Long Island.
a group called the Purists, an environmental terrorism group, claimed responsibility.
upstate New York, six months ago, that same group claimed responsibility and vowed to burn anything resembling urban sprawl.
explosions at a gas station and an SUV dealership, both committed by the Purists.
all told, over $100 llion in property damage.
Casualties-- zero.
any arrests?
even though they claimed responsibility, there was never enough evidence at any of the scenes to prosecute a single member.
they're smart, they're effective, and it appears they'll stop at nothing to get the message across.
on the left, Theodore Wicks, aka Teddy Mayhem.
he won't admit to bng the leader of the group.
instead, he refers to himself as a spokesman.
on the right, Len Barlow, his right-hand man, and assault victim of Michael Elgers.
that could be why, uh, Elgers' handwriting sample didn't match the rental paperwork.
that pile of crap was being set up.
what is the link to our bombing?
because this group didn't claim responsibility for this one.
this watch was recovered from the engine of the van.
now, it's solar-powered, which is a very nice touch.
it was used to trigger the explosion.
same trigger device was recovered at the gas station bombing.
Yeah, and they didn't take responsibility for this one because someone died.
exactly.
I don't understand.
animal research lab, urban sprawl, SUVs...
those I get.
but Felix Redman was an electronics recycler.
he's one of the good guys.
unfortunately, we don't have an answer for that.
what about the debris from the van?
I'm still piecing things together.
if we get lucky, we're gonna get a print.
and the bomb fragments?
the, uh, markings on the pipe bombs were not from a manufacturing defect.
I'm still working on it.
all right, we got a suspect.
what's our next move?
we keep digging for concrete evidence and a motive.
in the meantime, I'm gonna pay Mr. Mayhem a visit.
genius is one part inspiration...
and 99 parts...
devastation.
leave the perspiration to the cops.
neat trick.
and you are?
well, I'm not perspiring, but...
excuse me.
eco-friendly club.
interesting concept.
a responsible concept.
booths are made from recyclable fabric, floor is regenerative bamboo,
led lighting, FSC wood from sustainable forests.
if only others would follow suit.
you need to see my liquor license, or are you here for the deejay?
I came about Felix Redman.
I don't know any Felix Redman, and I get the feeling that if you had any evidence whatsoever that I do know this Felix Redman, we'd be having this conversation in a precinct.
your philosophy is changing, isn't it?
beg your pardon?
no casualties.
in the past, the Purists went to great lengths to ensure that no one was harmed as a result of your terrorist acts.
it may be terrorism to you, but to others, it's their duty as one of God's creatures.
that duty now includes killing human beings?
if people won't stop destroying this planet when you ask them nicely, when you repeatedly demonstrate that what they are doing is wrong, then they should be stopped using whatever means necessary.
you really believe you can save the planet with bombs?
I guess we'll find out, huh?
Hey, how's the head?
uh, good. You know, I'll live.
you know I'm curious.
what was going through your mind when thatomb went off?
well, uh, you know how they say your entire life is supposed to flash before your eyes when you think you're gonna die?
Yeah, I'm familiar with that one.
Yeah.
the only thing I could muster up is when Joey Allen beaned me in the head during a dodge ball game in third grade.
so, what'd you get?
I found this photo in the vic's sweatshirt pocket.
most of the damage occurred when the water main broke after the explosion.
I ran it through a Photosynth Algorithm and mapped coordinates.
thought it was going to get us somewhere.
And?
it got us to Guiyu, China.
nothing better than coming back and contributing absolutely nothing.
it's just good that you came back.
ready for this?
what's up?
I reassembled the rearview mirror from the van.
I got a partial print.
came back to his daughter.
Alison Redman blew up her own house?
that Alison, uh, Redman, our vic?
apparently, she was a member of the Purists.
her father's business clearly influenced her passion for protecting the environment.
but she chose a more destructive path.
it doesn't make sense, though.
why would Alison Redman go after her father?
Yeah, and if she did...
why would she be in that house when the bomb went off?
doesn't make any sense.
Lindsay'll be back before you know it, Danny.
I asked her to marry me, Mac. Did you know that?
she told me no.
said that I was...
just asking her because she was pregnant.
was she right?
no. I mean, I... I don't know, Mac.
I...I mean, I love her, I do. I know that.
but I just know myself, and-and I don't want to disappoint her.
or the kid.
those fears are normal, Danny.
I know that because, uh, I felt the same way with Claire.
all those doubts about who you are and what you're capable of.
I wasn't in a hurry to have children with Claire.
I always felt that in the end...
I might disappoint her.
or myself.
now she's gone, and it's something I'll always regret for the rest of my life.
God brought you and Lindsay together.
I believe that.
and you have been blessed with a gift.
the greatest gift that life has to offer.
you can choose to live in a place of fear...
or you can believe in the best version of yourself.
thank you.
Thanks. Appreciate that.
don't mention it.
Yeah.
you're gonna make a great father.
Hey, Adam.
come here for a second.
remember that photo you found in Alison Redman's pocket?
Yeah.
it wasn't such a waste, after all.
you may have just found my motive.
I did?
Yeah.
Guiyu, China is the e-waste capital of the world.
it's like Chernobyl over there.
is that our vic?
Yeah, that's her. Why?
Hey, can you get that?
when I was playing hockey, I saw this girl right before the explosion.
that was definitely her.
if she was targeting her father, why was she running toward the house?
mac, the marks on the pipe bomb-- they came from a vice.
the bomber must have used one to keep the pipes steady while he was constructing the bomb.
same principle as ballistics evidence.
the unique marks on the vice created the equivalent of lands and grooves on the pipe.
so if we can find that vice, maybe we can get a direct match to the marks.
and a direct link to the Purists.
I subpoenaed Teddy Mayhem's credit records going back two years.
he got all his supplies from a hardware store three blocks from his house.
now, I checked their records.
Teddy Mayhem bought a vice in March of '06.
enough for a warrant.
we got him.
we hit it here, here, and here.
at that hour there will be anywhere between 15 and 20 people in the building, so if anyone wants out, now's the time.
good.
NYPD! Freeze!
nothing personal.
just doing my duty as one of God's creatures.
what's this?
it's one of your shipng containers.
it's filled with computer monitors that contain cathode ray tubes.
each tube has several pounds of lead in it.
are you aware of that?
Yeah, of course I'm aware of that.
it's my business to be aware of that.
then it's also your business to be aware of the fact that it's illegal to export these overseas.
Yeah.
so how did this container end up in China?
lead, cadmium, mercury, chromium, polyvinyl chloride.
all of them are present in electronic waste, and all of them, when burned out in the open and breathed in, can cause brain damage, kidney disease, cancer.
good people...
responsible people...
line up at his facility hoping to do the right thing, and that two-faced son of a bitch smiles and then sells it on the black market.
500 pounds of explosives.
who does that?
I don't care how noble you think your cause is.
what if a child had been walking by that van?
did you ever think about that?
even with the most careful planning, did you ever consider how many innocent people might have been killed?
an example had to be set.
there are proper channels of dealing with it.
you call U. S. Customs or the Government Accountability Office.
why, because they're above board?
they do everything by the book?
every day I read about a different governmental branch where someone's taking a kickback or is getting paid to turn a blind eye.
and you know why you read about that?
because we're catching them.
I don't target their office and blow them up.
Felix Redman's actions are killing more people than I ever could.
okay, that, that container was not shipped with my company's permission.
well, I have the shipping manifest, so save it, I don't want to hear it.
peasant farmers in Guiyu, China are paid eight dollars a day to dismantle your circuit boards and burn your cathode ray tubes for the very valuable lead inside of them.
eight dollars a day to breathe in certain death.
look at them, Mr. Redman.
women, children.
just take a really good look.
pregnancies there are six times more likely to end up in miscarriage, and seven out of ten children have too much lead in their blood.
I understa why you targeted Felix Redman, but why Alison?
she was one of your own.
she didn't deserve to die.
you're right about that, but she deserved to know the truth about her father, so I opened up her eyes.
no. My father would not do that.
Alison, you need to face the truth.
your father is part of the problem, and you need to understand there's no turning back.
what does that mean?
it's done.
she ran to warn him.
I didn't think she had enough time to get there.
you've been trying to figure out what your daughter was doing in the house, right?
she's a member of the Purists.
it's an environmental terrorist organization.
ironic, huh?
the other members of her organization found out what you've been doing, and they told Alison they were going to take you out.
even though she knew the truth, your daughter still tried to save you.
she probably made it right through the front door when the bomb went off.
that's why you had no idea she was in the house.
you'll have a lot of time behind bars to think about all of this, so I'll just leave you with these images.
Alison rented the van.
that's how we found her print on the rearview mirror.
but she didn't know what it was for, did she?
why involve her in her own father's death?
every member plays a role; Alison was no exception, even if her father was the target.
you think you've won, don't you?
nobody wins in situations like this.
there are others-- good people-- and they'll carry out our message as long as people continue destroying this planet for their own self-interest.
how many students you have?
how many cells?
enough to get the job done.
well, I have a lot of good people that work for me.
and we're going to hunt them down one by one for as long as it takes.
Danny, what the hell are we doing here?
I'm leaving in the morning.
I got to pack.
you don't have to remind me that you're leaving.
it's all I've been thinking about.
then what are we doing here?
who are these friends I need to meet all of a sudden?
I think, uh, it's just around the corner here.
look, I'm tired of being afraid.
all right?
you and me-- we make sense.
okay?
you're everything I've always wanted.
I want to be with you...
and I can be the guy that you want me to be.
I know I can.
I am that guy.
I know you are.
then let's walk through this door together.
come on, let's do it.
let's take that leap.
you got a money order?
Congratulations.
thank you.
here you go.
what if I had said no?
not a chance.
Thanks.
you got your money order?
Danny Messer. How you doing?
I, Danny Messer... - I, Lindsay Monroe...
for richer, for poorer...
in sickness and in health...
Ah, Professor P.
does the name Sebastian Diakos mean anything to you?
pleasure to meet you.
what about George Kolovos?
how can I be of assistance?
those men should be in jail for antiquity smuggling.
these men are ruthless.
turn around and you die!
mac doesn't know. He already asked me to stand down.
communication's got a 911 from an unidentified female caller.
when units responded, they found Sebastian Diakos murdered.
let me take it.
I'm sorry, Stella.
what I said before still stands.
I can't have you investigating this.
I'm gonna handle this one personally.
you lied to me, Stella.
it wasn't my intent.
then why didn't you tell me you'd found Sebastian Diakos dead?
I had to find out from NYPD Communications.
I gave you a direct order to leave the Diakos investigation to me.
you chose to ignore it.
I made a decision, Mac, and frankly, I would make the same decision again.
I got a tip that he was on the move, so I took action.
what you did was make it personal.
it is personal. He tried to kill me.
you stepped way out of bounds on this one and you know it.
you're a detective and you make an anonymous call alerting the police to Diakos's apparent murder.
that's grounds for suspension!
or at least... a desk assignment!
you have any idea of the position you've put me in?
Oh, yes, I do.
you know what, I'm gonna make this easier for you.
chelsea University's Hellenic Club put on plays in the park every spring.
these gods and goddesses stepped right out of one tragedy into another.
looks like we have quite a few witnesses.
the audience saw the whole thing, only in silhouette.
first they thought it was part of the performance.
and the only descriptions I'm getting are "two dark figures in a struggle and a long sharp object.
any of the actors recognize the vic?
no and no I. D.
C. O.D. looks like exsanguination from two apparent stab wounds.
you find the murder weapon?
searching the area now.
you're looking for something cylirical, one inch wide.
annular wounds indicate that the blade would be thickest at the hilt.
we have an address.
unfortunately, it's not the victim's.
I don't know why my home address was in his pocket.
you're here as a witness, Stella. I need the truth.
you know the victim?
let me rephrase that.
how do you know this guy?
his name is George Kolovos.
he was a consultant with the Greek embassy
and he's Sebastian Diakos's partner.
mac, I know how this looks.
you do?
you lied to me, Stella.
this is the case you lied about.
now, a man you claim is the partner of Diakos is found dead with your home address in his pocket.
you owe me an explanation.
and something better than what you're giving me here.
look, Mac, I am just as confused as you are.
try.
all I know is that that vic, George Kolovos, should be in a Cypriot jail right now.
why is that?
in my attempt to prove that Sebastian Diakos was the one who attacked me...
I learned that both he and Kolovos were running an antiquities smuggling ring.
the Cypriot government was on the hunt for Kolovos, so, I... I delivered him.
you do know I have diplomatic immunity?
wait.
wait, where are you going?
wait!
come back here!
you let me out of here! Let me out!
he's all yours.
let's make a deal!
I was told that he would be arrested and detained.
how and when he got back to New York, I don't know.
why did he come back?
revenge.
and the guy who killed him just might have saved your life.
I recovered this fragment from Mr. Kolovos.
I thought it was a piece of the vic's bone that might have chipped off during the attack, but I found no evidence of a fracture.
in fact, this first injury didn't sever any vital organs or major arteries.
so it immobilized him, but didn't kill him.
right. He could have survived.
it was the second stab wound that was fatal.
you can see it here in the comparison of our two stab wounds.
it took a lot of force to go that deep.
punctured the heart.
although the wounds are identical in circular shape and come from the same weapon, tissue around the second wound is irregular.
indicating that the knife penetrated all the way to the hilt of the weapon, possibly causing subdermal bruising?
precisely. The force of the fatal stabbing left this bruising behind.
the ornate hilt of a knife.
that made a deadly first impression.
whoa, easy there, Priapus.
you wouldn't want to hurt a mere mortal.
Pria-who?
Priapus. The male god of virility?
Oh, that's what I call him.
that's right, huh?
all right, well, my personal weapon aside,
I managed to piece together and analyze several remnants of the white substance that Doc found at the scene.
it looks like our murder weapon was concealed in plaster.
and it had an imprint.
Adam, you score anything impressive?
as a matter of fact, uh, no.
the brown residue that Hawkes collected from the vic's shirt just turned outto be coffee grounds.
how's Lucy?
she's great.
her first visit to the lab is a big hit.
what, uh, what's Blake doing right now?
Oh, he's so good with babies.
she adores him.
no, she doesn't adore him.
the only man in her life is me.
Hey, buddy!
don't you have some DNA to look at?
wait out, Blake, here comes daddy!
looks like there's some sort of engraving.
it's Greek lettering.
it's on several of these raised points.
and see how the ornate hilt of the knife is completed by the bruise pattern on the victim's back?
Oh, yeah.
this looks like the other half of the impression that Sid got off Kolovos' body.
it's a perfect match.
Hey, Flack.
have you seen Angell?
s's out of town for a few days.
listen, when she gets back, can you tell her I need to talk to her about Kolovos?
the Central Park vic?
Yeah.
come here for a second.
look, Jess didn't tell me any of the details, just that the two of you were working on something, but if this involves her, I'd like you to tell me what it is because I care about her.
I know you do.
this isn't about Jess.
she's fine.
she was just helping me out, Flack.
how?
it started a couple of months ago, when I was trying to find out who tacked me.
I followed a trail and uncovered a smuggling ring.
Sebastian Diakos and George Kolovos were part of it.
they were smuggling Greek artifacts and selling them in the U. S.
is there anything else I should know?
anything I should do?
tell Jess that Kolovos is dead and she should step back.
I thought you were no longer working on the smuggling case.
it's a murder case now.
these are very dangerous men you're asking about.
that's why I've come to you.
you know the antiquities world betterhan anyone.
george Kolovos is dead.
it is a shame someone had to die.
I put Kolovos on a Cypriot registered ship headed for Cyprus, and somehow he ended up back here, dead, with my home address in his pocket.
Stella mou, I warned you about how dangerous those men were.
let it go... coreetsy mou.
you know, these men you talk about - who are they?
why would they want Kolovos dead and how would they know about me?
I don't know.
in order for him to get back into this country,
Kolovos had to know someone powerful.
someone connected to the Cypriot government.
you have friends in those circles.
you must have heard other names associated to the smuggling ring.
no, no, nothing.
I'm so sorry, Stella.
I... I wish I knew more.
it's okay, it's okay.
it's just that...
I'll never forget the first time you came to St. Basil's Academy.
it was your birthday.
Yes.
ever since then, you've always been my guardian angel.
I am.
always.
and don't you forget that.
the bruising on our vic and the ornate hilt of the dagger combine to form the golden star of Vergina.
it was the symbol for the ancient kingdom of Macedon.
what?
what are you doing here?
Where's Lucy?
she's in Ballistics analyzing striae.
look, I have been here exactly two hours.
I'm leaving in 40 minutes.
I just wanted to fill in a few blanks on the case.
you are paying me to work part-time.
besides, this lab would fall apart without me.
okay, according to the translations I've read, these symbols read Aristotle, Homer,
leonidas, Achilles, Hercules, Dionysus, Mieza, and Pella.
now, Pella was the capital of ancient Macedon and...
it was the birthplace of Alexander the Great.
now, as Greek legend goes, these particular engravings were located on one specific star.
it was used to decorate an ornate dagger crafted of ivory and gold.
was apparently the most valuable thing to be buried with Alexander the Great.
I guess it was going to prepare him for battle in the afterlife.
wait, you're not saying that our murder weapon is that dagger.
Lindsay...the location of Alexander's tomb is one of the most famous archeological mysteries of all time.
no one's ever found it. If they had, we'd know about it.
you guys are going to want to see this.
Sid pulled this out of our vic's stab wound.
thought it might be bone.
I ran it through SEM.
it's ivory.
the shape is a match to the dagger - to the ivory in the blade.
explains how it ended up inside the vic's wound.
and check this out.
I carbon-dated the ivory and it came back to approximately 300 B. C.
that is a piece of history.
ancient history.
so after a diaper change, Lucy and I lifted a partial print...
and got a match.
to someone dead or alive?
this guy's breathing and living in New York.
it's personal; I should be asking you that question.
I mean, this can't be a coincidence.
Kosta Papakota is a suspect in Kolovos' murder.
what? That's insane.
if you know something, Stella, you should tell us.
what I know is that the professor has nothing to do with this.
actually, his prints are on the plaster cast of our murder weapon, Stella, and we got a positive match to Chelsea University instructor database.
so faculty advisor at the Hellenic Club could put him at the park.
this has got to be some kind of a mistake.
guys, I've known this man since I was a kid.
he got me out of foster care.
he practically saved my life.
there is no way he's involved in smuggling, let alone murder.
okay, fine, let's go inside and talk to him.
I'm sure he can clear this all up.
professor, it's Stella.
he's inside. I mean, we just got finished talking.
professor!
NYPD! Open up!
Oh, come on, Flack, that's not necessary.
Stella, please.
professor?
he's gone.
don't like the looks of this.
he said he was on his way to Florida to give a lecture.
Oh, yeah? Any reason why he'd use the back door instead of the front?
he took his passport.
this is an international code.
Stella, we lost him.
looks like everybody's in a hurry today.
congratulations, Stella.
wh's this? - Open it. From Greece.
I am proud of you, Stella mou.
I love it. Thank you so much.
in my attempt to prove that Sebastian Diakos was the one who attacked me,
I learned that both he and Kolovos were running an... an antiquities smuggling ring.
what's going on, Stella?
after I deciphered the stamp of authenticity from the matte behind the painting,
I ran an Internet search.
found out the painting was stolen from an exhibit at the Metropolitan Art Museum;
an exhibit put together... by Professor Papakota in 1977.
we have any idea how the painting ended up in Stella's office?
you know, Stella did mention once that it was a gift, but she didn't say where she got it from.
my guess is Professor Papakota.
Yeah, but if she knew it was stolen, she would have never kept it.
which might explain why she and the painting are both missing right now.
there's got to be a connection.
all right, well, speaking of Greeks bearing gifts, looks like our murder weapon was also smuggled in from Greece.
trace I lifted from the inside of the plaster containscalcium carbonate and Prunus persica- peach tree root- indigenous to northern Greece.
Papakota's prints on the plaster indicate he could have been involved in smuggling the dagger here from Greece.
what it doesn't do is prove he murdered Kolovos.
well, maybe this cup you guys found at Professor P's apartment will help.
now, the trace we found on our vic's shirt was dried Greek coffee grounds, right?
right.
what's one of the main differences between Greek and American coffee?
it's not filtered.
the grounds actually sit at the bottom of the coffee cup.
exactly.
you only drink the top portion of the coffee, leaving your saliva in the grounds.
along with your DNA.
now, I compared the DNA from the grounds this cup and the DNA on the grounds that were found on our vic's shirt.
it's a perfect match.
it is the same person's DNA.
all right, well, it's not looking too good for Professor Papakota's tenure.
these samples are a match to each other, Danny.
what we have to prove is a connection to the professor.
Hey, I checked all the major airlines, bus terminals, car rental agencies.
so far, Professor Papakota's in the wind.
but I did manage to track down Stella.
after running her credit cards, I found that her last purchase was with an online travel agency.
do you speak English?
uh... a little bit, yes.
my name is Stella Bonasera.
I am Tasso.
Tasso... of course.
you're Professor Papakota's brother.
I've heard so much about you.
I'm... I'm a friend of Kosta's.
I'm so sorry. I, uh... I... I just finish the garden.
uh, yes. My brother, he's not here.
he lives in Ameriki.
uh, Nea Yorki... uh, New York.
Yes, yes, I know.
uh, I believe he's now here in Thessaloniki, and I must speak with him.
please tell me he is okay, yes?
Yes, I... I think he is fine.
if you've heard from him, it's important that you tell me.
uh, no, he, uh... no, no, I have heard nothing. Uh, no.
okay, well, if you do, please tell him that I'm staying at the Hotel Drakos.
of course.
professor!
professor, wait!
professor?
I can confirm the man second on the left is Kosta Papakota, head of the 1977 restoration project.
that woman over there looks very much like this woman in your photograph.
Stella, this is, uh, Areti Moungri of the museum;
christos Temmas of the Greek Intelligence Authority.
I came here straight from theirport.
why don't you tell them, uh, why we're here?
about the artwork.
Oh, right.
I believe this belongs to your country.
detective Taylor mentioned you were in possession of the Medusa.
and although I am very happy it has returned home,
I must ask how you came to possess in the first place.
it was a gift from someone I thought was a friend.
as I mentioned, Detective Bonasera had no idea the gift was stolen property.
now that she's here and she knows, she's going to return it.
I can vouch for her - we've worked together for over ten years.
I appreciate this, Detective Taylor, but protocol demands we ask the questions.
of course.
if you'll excuse me, I will take this for safekeeping.
now... you are free to leave the museum, Miss Bonasera.
however, you cannot depart from the country until we have had a chance to fully investigate your claim.
in regards to your murder investigation, Detective...
I'm completely prepared to work with you and Thessaloniki law enforcement.
I am glad to hear that.
you have been authorized to carry a weapon.
obviously, I would prefer if you do not use it.
I will phone you.
thank you.
they didn't just let us go.
Temmas told Areti we'd be followed.
I assumed as much.
Stella, we think the dagger that was used to kill Kolovos was originally from the lost tomb of Alexander the Great.
that's impossible.
well, there's evidence to suggest it.
the chemical makeup of the soil that we found on the plaster cast is indigenous to this part of Greece.
so... Diakos, Kolovos and the professor may have discovered the lost tomb of Alexander somewhere here in Thessaloniki.
that's where the evidence points.
mac, I know I was wrong to keep investigating the case after you told me to step down.
I'm sorry that I made it difficult for you and for the department.
this isn't about my job or the department.
it was difficult because I care about you.
thank you.
I know this is personal for you.
I understand that now.
I found trace of the Ancient Macedon Museum's stamp of authenticity on the painting.
I did some digging into the museum and Professor P.
who's the woman in this photo?
I think it might be your mother.
although they don't identify her.
I did some research.
she was a restoration artist from Naoussa, Gree.
she came to New York with an art exhibit in 1977.
she brought her two-year-old daughter with her on the trip.
a few days after the exhibit, there was a traffic accident.
she was killed instantly.
professor said he didn't knew my mother.
I mean... if this is her, why didn'he ever tell me?
it's tough for me to tell you now.
can't imagine telling a young girl.
do you really think that...
ever since then, you've always been my... guardian angel.
he's not a murderer, Mac.
look, I know that's w you feel, but the DNA doesn't lie, Stella.
a coffee cup was recovered from the professor's apartment.
the DNA and the coffee grounds from the cup match the trace we found on ouric's shirt.
we're trying to confirm a match to the professor.
you don't have to.
he wasn't alone.
well, you can't be sure of that.
come on, don't let your emotions cloud your judgment.
no, no. No, Mac, I...
the coffee cup from his apartment, I... I remember it.
don't like the looks of this.
it was turned upside down.
you don't ever turn over a Greek coffee cup unless you're going to read the grounds.
it's a type of fortune-telling, and... and you never read your own.
the professor must have been reading someone else's grounds.
mac, send Danny back to the professor's apartment to find evidence to prove it.
if I'm right about this...
someone else was in his apartment, and the DNA you found wasn't the professor's.
so, Stella was right.
professor P is not our killer.
Nope, Lindsay compared the reference sample she pulled from his apartment to the DNA we found on our vic.
it's not his dnA, but it is a filial matchto the professor
professor P must have a brother.
he's the one who was drinking coffee.
Yes, and the one who killed Kolovos.
Freeze!
he knew you were closing in on him.
this is why he came after you.
all clear.
our murder weapon was concealed in plaster.
the items here seem to be consistent with our findings in the U. S.
this is hard to understand.
greed is a powerful motive.
it wasn't just greed.
it was disappointment, and ultimately, revenge.
the Papakotas lost their land.
my family once owned a beautiful peach farm.
but one day, my fher found a marble foot.
a marble foot?
it was part of a beautiful ancient ruin.
my family did the honorable thing and let the government take the land in exchange for a stipend.
but that money did not last long, and when we found oursels in need...
there was no place for us to tu.
they blamed the government for ruining their lives.
and chose to plunder your country's riches.
we appreciate all the information that you have shared with us, Detective, but this is our investigation now.
I'm so sorry. I, uh, I... I just finish the garden.
I didn't come all the way to Greece to turn this murder investigation over to you.
it's okay, Mac.
it looks like Detective Temmas has everything under control.
when I first met Tasso, he said he'd been working in the garden.
and he was wearing one of these.
not a lot of gardens in the city.
I didn't notice one at the house.
exactly.
tasso wasn't just digging for geraniums.
we need to share this lead with Temmas.
look, Mac... I don't have my badge.
I'm not here in Greece on official business.
I'm here to get answers.
answers to questions that I don't believe Temmas would be willing to ask.
I would never expect you to do anything illegal or disregard protocol.
I just... I want time to find the professor before Temmas.
mac, this is my only chance to learn the truth about who I am.
see these white crystals?
trace I lifted from the inside of the plaster contains calcium carbonate and Prunus persica-peach tree root- indigenous to northern Greece.
if that trace in the soil is calcium carbonate, we just might be closer to catching Tasso.
all the world's a lab.
the water in the fountain contains dilute hydrochloric acid.
that should be enough to get us started.
now all we need is a heat source.
pure platinum.
perfect catalyst and a perfect sample holder.
not exactly what I had in mind when I bought them.
brick red flame.
we've got calcium carbonate.
same compound Danny found in the soil from the murder weapon.
calcium carbonate is the primary ingredient in a pesticide called asvestis.
it was as toxic to humans as it was to bugs.
then the Greek government would've takent off the market.
only it looks like someone here is still using it.
there are a lot of farms in Northern Greece.
there sure are.
and here we go.
got an article written a year ago.
local peach farmer was fined for using the asvestis pesticide.
they give a name?
no.
no, but it was discovered when a tourist ate a piece of tainted fruit while visiting the farm.
it's adjacent to the Agia Maria National Park.
that's about 30 minutes from here.
if we find that farm, we might just find the professor and his brother.
if they know we're on to them, they'll go back to the location where they found the dagger for one last score.
this has got to be the orchard where they use the pesticide.
you all right? - Yeah.
stay here.
wait.
professor!
stop it!
all these years...
I looked up to you.
I believed in you.
and you were nothing. Nothing but a thief.
we lost everything when we gave up our land.
you didn't just steal artifacts from your country.
U stole from me.
you knew my mother.
you knew her.
you knew who she was.
and you never told me.
Signomi... Koritsi mou, I am so sorry.
your mother...
I met her here...
she was so beautiful, so talented.
the painting I gave you was the last thing she worked on.
I wanted you to have a part of her with you always.
but, Kosta, you stole it.
drop your weapon!
Professor...!
drop it!
Stella, you are okay? Okay?
Oh, no.
I was going to put them all back.
you do it.
give... Put them back.
tasso has gone too far.
no one knows.
I loved your mother.
Oh, Mac.
tasso Papakota was responsible for the murder of George Kolovos.
he was there that night in Central Park.
it is magnificent.
are you sure it's authentic?
what?
you think we would lie to you?
how dare you question us!
you are the one to ruin everything.
you exposed us all when you killed Diakos.
and I could just as easily kill you, old man.
tasso saved his brother's life in Central Park.
today, he took it.
thank you again for your efforts, Detectives.
we are now in the process of relocating all the stolen artifacts from the Papakota home to the museums.
once we close the case back in New York, you can rest assured that whatever artifacts we recover will be sent back, as well.
you are Greek?
I was born here.
just a... a hole in the ground, with some dirt, a few stones.
I tossed the artifacts and the dagger inside.
I- I... I don't think I even heard them land.
what happenswhen someone else digs up those treasures?
that's up to the Greek government, not me.
I'm really good at this.
are you ready?
I'm as ready as I'll ever be.
okay, let's see here.
your psixi has a shadow.
my what?
your psixi. Your soul.
see, the-the bottom of the cup tells me how you're feeli today.
and when you have a problem, it weighs heavy on your soul.
so I have a problem?
Yes, and... well, it involves a woman.
see, this woman...
seems as though you have something that belongs to her.
this item is gold and is worth far more in honor than fortune.
you know, I don't need coffee grounds to see how lucky I am to have you in my life, Mac.
okay, okay, what do you... what do you got in here?
see, there you go.
see that right there? That's an "S.
that would be Stella, the woman in your life who sometimes you adore, and sometimes she drives you crazy.
open it.
Oh, my God.
mac, there must have been 20 people trapped back there when it hit the water.
that hatch is how they escaped.
it's a miracle we only have two bodies.
make that three.
what happened here, Don?
this was a truck party gone bad.
it's the latest craze in after-hours entertainment.
they convert tractor trailers into exclusive nightclubs.
times and locations are spread among the social networks.
well, I'm assuming this one didn't start at the bottom of the Hudson.
I thought the truck was not supposed to move once the party starts.
it's not.
so who moved it?
couple cabbies nearly got run over, but they didn't get a good look at the driver's face.
they did say that he accelerated through the fence.
and the absence of skid marks confirms that there was no braking.
then the driver could have drowned, or may still be among the survivors.
well, we have divers in the water looking for more bodies, and the others are being transported to the precinct for questioning.
driver saw that river coming, jumped out before splashdown, then got the hell out of Dodge.
either way, looks like crashing this party wasn't an accident.
so, it's looking like whoever padlocked the rear door also drove the truck.
I found keys to the lock in the driver's side glove box.
unfortunately, the water removed any biological trace.
but I also found this next to our driver's seat.
Yeah, the label was removed, so I had Adam run a sample through the IR SPEC...
came back as acetylene.
mixed with oxygen, acetylene is used for cutting metal.
Or...for welding the safety hatch shut.
I found spot welds all around the frame, and then I found tiny metal fragments embedded in the driver's seat and in the carpet under the accelerator pedal.
multiple people may have planned this, but all the evidence points to only one person who carried it out.
a single perp. - Premeditated.
he knew people were going to suffer.
he didn't care.
if the safety hatch was sealed, how'd the survivors break through?
shoddy workmanship.
surface impurities in the under filling left the seams vulnerable to high-contraction stresses.
water pressure and, uh, freezing temperatures did the rest.
if this guy had known what he was doing, the hatch would have held, and they might all be dead.
just spoke with Flack.
the truck was rented with an alias from a party outfitter in Queens.
the owner was sent a big old wad of cash about two weeks ago.
someone had to pick it up.
no. The company dropped it off on the street, was scheduled to pick it up the next morning.
they left the keys?
they didn't have to. It was hot-wired.
this creep thought of everything.
to identify him, we still need to know why.
it's all about exclusivity.
just being invited means you're a somebody.
I don't think I'll ever forget that sound.
the screaming.
Abigail, did you see anybody near the cab of the truck?
somebody who could have driven it?
the truck was parked.
I assumed it was going to stay that way.
who threw this party?
a girl at work told me about it.
so you just showed up uninvited?
as long as you look hot, getting in is never a problem.
it was crazy, man.
one minute, I'm chatting up this really cute blonde.
the next...
great party?
did you know the people at the party?
somebody you may have hung out with before?
I don't go out much anymore.
tonight was supposed to be a change of pace.
instead, I almost died.
when was the rear door closed?
I was dancing, enjoying some cocktails.
I didn't notice.
any idea who might have closed it?
could have been anyone.
we were all having the time of our lives.
then all of a sudden, it felt like the world was coming to an end.
the water was so cold, it felt like my body was on fire.
the clock was ticking.
I knew we had to get everyone out of there.
we tried the back door, but it wouldn't budge.
that's because it was locked.
locked?
wait a minute, are you telling me someone did this to us on purpose?
Why?
that's exactly what we're going to find out.
the escape hatch was our last hope.
had to get it open.
listen, Chris, when you arrived at the party, was there someone there to greet you?
like, was there a host?
not really, just...
I just followed the music.
that guy over there is a hero.
I don't even know his name.
his name is Chris.
I owe him my life.
we all do.
was there anybody in the water that you didn't recognize from the party?
it was too dark.
I closed my eyes and kicked as hard as I could.
what about on the dock?
honestly, all I could think about was seeing my family again.
once I was out of the truck, I swam towards the light.
that first breath of air was like I was being reborn.
that must sound crazy.
you're one of the lucky ones.
not everybody got out alive?
no, not everybody.
cameron Marshall, age 27.
copious quantities of river water in his lungs and stomach confirms COD as drowning.
looks like vic number two's throat was crushed.
Brett Hollister, age 25.
suffered blunt force laryngeal trauma resulting in complete cricotracheal separation.
water in the lungs?
trace amounts.
he stopped breathing before the truck sank.
I imagine he floated up through the open hatch.
sadly, victim number three wasn't quite as fortunate.
doctor? - Thank you.
an elevated blood alcohol content caused vasodilation of her blood vessels, thereby exacerbating the onset of hypothermia.
she would have experienced numbness, debilitating drowsiness.
she knew she was drowning but was powerless to stop it.
her last moments on earth were spent in excruciating pain.
just got fingerprint results.
unlike her male counterparts, she wasn't carrying a wallet in her back pocket.
AFIS match courtesy of an old DUI arrest.
Jane Doe is actually Ms. Victoria Enzo of Queens.
our female vic is the daughter of Carmen Enzo, head of Local 225...
sanitation Workers' Union.
type of goons you cross the street to avoid.
so the party and random guests could've just been a cover.
the murderer might have been targeting only one person: Enzo's daughter.
two sanitation workers were killed last year by faulty equipment.
Enzo negotiated a sweetheart deal favoring their employers, betraying a boat load of union members in the process.
his daughter's murder could have been retribution.
that's a lot of collateral damage to send a message.
not if you want it received loud and clear.
you don't have any idea who did this to my girl, do you?
not yet.
when Vicky was little, she used to love to play dress up.
her favorite...
was to dress up in this...
white satin wedding dress her mother made for her.
my job was walking her down the make-believe aisle.
I'm sorry for your loss.
I have no use for your sympathy.
well, then know that every effort is being made to bring your daughter's killer to justice.
justice.
justice means different things to different people, Detective.
Mr. Enzo...
there are serious consequences for interfering with a police investigation.
then stop wasting time...
so I won't have to.
we have reason to believe that Victoria may have been targeted because of you and the nature of your work.
her murder may have been a warning.
you and the other members of your family may still be in danger.
I've made my fair share of enemies over the years.
occupational hazard.
but my wife...
and my children...
they're supposed to be off limits.
not everybody cares about the rules.
I'm going to need the names of your most vocal opponents, personal and professional.
that's a long list.
sit down.
there's someone you gotta meet.
Vicky wasn't supposed to be at that party.
how do you know that, Jessica?
because I was the one invited...
not her.
I asked her to go in my place.
it's my fault that she's dead.
it should have been me!
I got the invitation in the mail a couple months ago.
said I was a VIP.
was there any indication who sent it?
return address? RSVP number?
no, I-I...
I remember thinking how weird that was, but...
I mean, look at it. It's a work of art. It...
if someone put that much effort into the invite, the party itself was going to be insane.
when did you tell Victoria about the party?
couple hours before it was supposed to start.
I was stuck at the bar where I work, and...
and if I wasn't going to enjoy it, I...
at least wanted her to.
you could have gone late.
the directions...they were very clear.
they said that no one was getting in after midnight.
or getting out.
we need to know who else our mystery host personally invited.
all right, so, I got nine guests who heard about the party word of mouth...
some received texts, some got it through tweets, but none actually received an invite.
and none of them know anything about the driver.
I interviewed two who described handmade invitations like Jessica Thompson's:
Chris Boyle and Abigail West.
add Neal Cooper to that list.
he said he got his invite in the mail, as well.
Hawkes checked with the families of the two male DOAs.
they said both had plans for the evening but changed them to go check out some truck party.
if they heard about it last minute, let's eliminate them for now.
all right, so that leaves us with four VIPs.
the killer used formal invitations to ensure his targets would be in attendance.
if we can find a connection between them...
we'll know who wanted them dead.
how do you want to play this?
divide and conquer.
individually, each holds an important piece of the puzzle.
they just don't know it yet.
here you go.
well, they all look familiar.
but then again, I'm a bartender.
I see hundreds of faces every day.
right.
her.
Yeah, I saw this one at the party.
what about before last night?
no.
you sure about that?
Oh, yeah.
I'd remember a face like that.
I don't want to be wrong.
it's not a test.
close your eyes. It might help to visualize meeting them.
I'm sorry.
I can't remember.
were all of these people at the party last night?
not all of them.
I'm not very good at this.
my parents taught me to look past physical appearances.
they sound like smart people.
they were.
Neal, can you think of anybody who'd want to hurt you?
someone from your past?
person you might have accidentally rubbed the wrong way?
was there anybody that might have held a grudge against you?
I'm a housewife from Jersey.
I have two little kids.
this party was the first time I had been out in a long time.
the only thing that I can think of are the phone calls.
phone calls?
prank calls, in the middle of the night, over and over, from what sounded like the same man. I...
he didn't tell me his name, but he told me to watch my back.
did you report him to the police?
I was going to, but then they stopped.
I just figured that he had moved on to somebody else.
prank calls? Actually...
Yeah. Now that you mention it, someone did call me a bunch of times.
they didn't say anything.
they just laughed.
anything else out of the ordinary?
the garbage cans.
what about them?
they had been rifled through, tipped over, every day for a week.
could have been an animal.
that's what I thought.
but my husband, he tied down the covers, and it kept happening.
we finally had to put them in the garage.
someone was rummaging through my life.
through my family's life.
I mean, this was years ago.
someone has been watching me this whole time?
Jessica Thompson's car was broken into seven times over a six-month period, and nothing was ever stolen.
all four of them experienced incidents of aggravated harassment over a similar time period.
sounds like they all had a stalker.
but not necessarily the same one.
you think this may be a coincidence?
stalking is about obsession.
typically with a single object of intense hate or affection.
in rare cases of multiple victims, there is almost always a consistent pattern or modality.
our targets include both men and women, across a wide social spectrum.
but if they were all being stalked by the same individual, then we're gonna have to dig a whole lot deeper to find the common trigger.
until we do, the only confirmed link between them is the invitation.
what the...?
find something?
Yeah, check this out.
I started with the paper, vellum...
that comes from the French for "calfskin.
it's vegetable-based and still mondo bucks.
it was negative for prints and available in over a dozen stores in the area.
what about the ink?
Japanese.
made only in the fall with pine and camphor.
also ridiculously expensive.
but there was something else in the batch.
human blood.
I-I'm thinking it's from the artist who made the invitation.
or anyone else who handled it.
no chance.
the blood saturation is consistent throughout.
it was mixed in the ink before it was dried.
excuse us.
who are you?
the art police.
we have some thoughts and concerns.
how you doing?
did you make this invitation?
I make art, not stationery.
we matched the DNA in the ink to an ex-con named Wanda Cole.
now, Wanda certainly isn't as exotic as Akiko, but neither is writing bad checks and running scams on the elderly.
that was a misunderstanding.
of course it was.
so in order to avoid any more misunderstandings, let's try this again.
is this your work, Wanda?
I put blood in my ink to verify authenticity.
did one of your regulars commission these invitations?
like I said, I don't typically do stationery, but this guy paid up front,$20, 000 cash, five grand apiece.
what was his name?
John something.
smith, maybe.
how about a description?
wasn't much to describe.
he barely made eye contact.
I guess I make men nervous.
what do you remember?
he had, uh, dark hair, light skin.
bit of a stutter.
dark hair, light skin, a bit of a stutter.
that is very helpful.
maybe there's a better way to jog an artist's memory.
there you go.
the likeness is vague, but it may help spark a memory.
I didn't...
I didn't want to say anything before,'cause I thought I was just being paranoid.
well, tell me what happened.
well, I was coming out of a movie, and I stopped for a bite to eat, and that's when I saw him. He was staring at me. And...
there was something in his eyes.
you think this could be the guy?
Yes. But his, uh, well, his...
his eyes were further apart, um...
and they were...
they were deeper set.
and, uh, yeah, I think his hair was longer on the sides.
and, uh, he had a scar.
I'm sure of it.
ladies' room is around the corner, three doors down.
okay.
I'll wait right here. - Thanks.
Jessica, what is it?
that's Johnny.
you know that man?
we were engaged.
I met John senior year of college.
we went out one time, and then...
lost track of each other after that.
when did you reconnect?
About...three years ago.
a mutual friend set us up on a blind date.
we started dating on and off after that.
then last year, he surprised me with an engagement ring.
and you accepted his proposal?
at first, yes.
but then I saw a side of him that made me uncomfortable.
uncomfortable how?
he became possessive and needy.
if I didn't check in with him regularly, he would accuse me of cheating.
I even caught him following me.
things got...
they got really bad between us.
I know what you're thinking, but you're wrong.
I didn't dump Johnny.
he called it off with me.
that type of behavior's consistent with stalking.
could have been John's misguided attempt at repairing the relationship.
why didn't Jessica mention this before?
she could've missed the connection.
or she's covering for him.
ran John Everett through the system.
apart from a few unpaid parking tickets, he's a regular choir boy.
giant leap from double-parking to mass murder.
not with the proper motivation.
all right, so far, we've linked him to Neal Cooper, Jessica Thompson...
what about the other two?
I showed his picture to Abigail West, and she said he could be the perv job who's been hanging around her kids' park.
but she wasn't 100% sure.
similar thing with Chris Boyle.
he interrupted a guy breaking into his gym locker a while back.
chased the guy, but never got a good look at his face.
why go after them?
their lives must have intersected somewhere else.
John Everett! NYPD!
bedroom's clear. This place is empty.
he could be on the run already.
issue an alert.
put his picture out to every roll call and precinct in the city.
got it.
bit of overkill on the deadbolts for such a decent neighborhood, no?
this guy must've been afraid of something.
or the world in general.
social isolation.
an indication of paranoid schizophrenia.
I'll be right back. - All right.
what do you got there?
looks like we got some dried blood.
could be from another vic.
detective.
thought I made myself clear.
any interference with this investigation will not be tolerated.
Everett hasn't been back here or to his mother's house in Brooklyn.
how do you know his name?
I got eyes and ears on the street, just like you, Detective.
just go home.
I'll call you when we have the suspect in custody.
if I find him first, maybe I'll give you a call.
Jo. So I examined the bloodstains we found in Everett's apartment, and I got this.
two unique profiles.
blood came from different people, both male.
and I took the liberty of borrowing Everett's toothbrush for a secondary reference sample.
I got a match to one of the profiles.
what about the other?
struck out with CODIS, but whoever it was made that head-sized crater in the wall.
dark hairs I found in the drywall are a match to blood donor number two.
so Everett fought with someone in his apartment.
Yeah, and by the looks of that hole, he kicked some ass.
maybe one of his stalking victims came to confront him.
are you absolutely sure?
I'll be right there. - Something turn up?
coast Guard found Everett's body trapped in submerged pylons way downriver.
current is especially strong this time of year.
how long was he in the water?
skin slippage suggests immersion of at least 24 hours.
hello.
I'll posit penetrating cranial trauma as COD.
looks like there's something inside.
look at his clothing.
he's dressed to impress.
but the driver did everything he could not to be seen.
this guy wanted to be noticed.
I think John Everett was a guest at the party.
could he have also been the host?
not unless he invited himself.
this was in his back pocket.
a fifth invitation.
the artist said she only made four.
that means one of our victims has been lying to us.
according to Everett's phone records, he's got hundreds of inbound calls coming in, all lasting under five seconds.
he was also being harassed.
explains the deadbolts and covered windows.
landlord also said John came home a few months ago to surprise a guy searching through his stuff.
I pulled the complaint report.
Everett described the guy as skinny, mid-to-late 20s, with dark hair.
says they fought, but the guy got away.
John Everett wasn't doing the stalking, he was a victim of it himself.
makes him the real fourth target.
Hey, guys, we processed the clothing Everett was wearing when he died, including some handmade biker boots.
the toe plate was riveted in a crescent fashion.
it's the same pattern I found dented into the driver's side door.
all right, so he kicked the side of the truck?
or used it for leverage.
what if the driver never made it out of the cab before it went into the river?
what if he was also trapped?
John saw a man about to drown and went back to save him.
if Everett recognized him as the man in his apartment, he would have outed him to the cops.
and that's why he killed him first.
so he risks his life to save this sick bastard, and instead of getting a well-deserved thanks, gets a body bag?
the company that rented the truck is called Demon Dog Deliveries.
and that's the hood emblem they use on all their vehicles, a demon dog.
except, the one on our truck is missing its left horn.
John's body washed away, while his murderer swam to the surface and played helpless victim.
so one of our victims is really our driver.
there's a killer among us.
Jessica Thompson wasn't at the party.
I mean, she could've done this.
Why?
sour grapes over her fiance giving her the heave-ho?
that's no good.
her boss confirmed that she was behind the bar all night.
Plus, the dragon lady was pretty damn sure that she sold the invites to a stuttering man.
that's that.
that also eliminates Abigail West.
and then there were two.
we're gonna need the invitation you received for evidence.
I'm sure I've got it somewhere.
I brought the invitation with me to the party.
where is it now?
probably at the bottom of the river.
okay. You told Detective Messer you felt a responsibility to rescue everyone from the truck.
it was the right thing to do.
it was quite heroic.
I'm-I'm no hero.
well, you will be.
when the world hears about all the lives you saved?
magazines, talk shows...
this tragedy's going to make you the center of attention.
that's the last thing I want.
Why?
I was a...
high school All-American.
starting quarterback in college.
sports was easy, but...
being in the spotlight all the time, that's what I couldn't handle.
ruined my chances at going pro.
your parents are deceased.
they died in an accident last year.
must've been difficult for you.
did you get help?
talk to a therapist?
there's nothing wrong with me.
never said there was.
wait.
would you...
put that on the table?
hold on.
pour Mr. Cooper a glass.
you have a girlfriend, Neal?
why does that matter?
there were a lot of women at that party.
beautiful, sexy women, way out of your league.
I didn't really notice.
tell me, Neal...
why do you think a guy like you got invited to hang out with all those pretty people?
I don't want to talk to her; I want to go home.
answer the question.
I...I don't know.
must've been a mistake, right?
I mean, come on, let's face it, you're just an average, ordinary nobody.
a loser.
the kind that women like me don't know exist.
bitch!
you think that you're b-better than me, don't you?
not better than you, Neal.
just not a murderer.
we searched your apartment, found your parent" life insurance policy.
you've been plotting revenge for years, haven't you?
the sudden influx of cash finally made it possible.
you d-d-don't know anything.
we know you tutored Chris Boyle, first few months freshman year.
Chris spent the rest of his time partying with the in-crowd, while you spent all your time by yourself.
he never invited me out, n-n-not once!
and Abigail West.
she grew up across the street from your family.
she was your best friend, until middle school.
when Abigail found a new set of friends and left you behind.
she abandoned me!
Jessica Thompson never even knew your name.
but you certainly knew hers, didn't you?
we found the poems you wrote, the sketches.
the photos you took of her and John Everett.
J-Jessica was in love with him, and he threw her away.
he d-deserved to die!
and when you couldn't have her, so did Jessica.
N-N-N-Nobody wanted me.
I was tired of being alone.
that's why I'm gonna do everything in my power to make sure that you spend the rest of your life in solitary confinement.
all alone.
Neal Cooper lived his entire life convinced the world had wronged him.
decided to kill the people he held most responsible.
if he'd spent less time blaming them, he'd have realized the real enemy was himself.
perception can be a dangerous thing.
here he comes! Here he comes!
Neal Cooper, ask you a few questions?
he killed my daughter!
let's go find a wild stallion to tame.
ready?
30 seconds.
come on, come on.
we're in.
10, 000 cars were stolen in New York City last year.
all right, that's 28 a day.
early this year, auto crime division identified a ring specializing in luxury imports.
a few months back, the perps got a taste for Italian.
and now they're only stealing Ferraris.
16 of 'em in eight weeks.
suspects are female.
mid-to-late 20s, one blonde, one brunette.
beyond that, details are sketchy.
so far, they've avoided surveillance cameras and most eyewitnesses.
they target vehicles parked on the street, and they're able to bypass the most advanced security systems.
these girls are good, but they've been lucky.
all right, and that's gonna change sooner or later, and when that happens,
I want one of us to be there.
all right, you got your shift assignments. Let's get out of here, let's be safe.
Sarge, you must have a thing for parking garages.
this is the fifth one we've checked out tonight.
Yes, it is. You want to tell me why?
cause stolen cars with theft recovery devices emit a tracking signal, but the battery only lasts three days.
thief stashes the vehicle, walks away.
if it hasn't been found by the time he gets back...
probably never will.
whoa, whoa, stop, stop, stop.
engine's still running on that car.
you know what to do?
keep our eyes open, stay in the blind spots.
Hey, Mac.
so, ACD confirms the vehicle was stolen two nights ago, and, uh, DOT checked local traffic cameras.
guess who likes to run red lights?
the victim's one of our elusive car thieves.
we have a name?
she had no I. D. on her.
what do you think?
that photo puts her behind the wheel.
now we got to figure out who put her in the trunk.
we got powder flecks on some of the controls knobs inside, and some kind of crushed electronic device outside, but other than that, I can say this is officially the cleanest Ferrari I've ever been in.
and how many is that?
well, it depends if you're talking stock or race modified.
checked with lot security.
guard did a walk-through two hours ago.
Ferrari wasn't here yet. Narrows our time frame.
car could have been dumped here with her already in the trunk.
boosting cars is a dangerous game.
but a really lucrative one.
a car like this, on the black market, would sell for a fortune.
and even more if you sell the parts individually.
and why would it still be sitting here?
he may not have killed her for the car, but simply because she stole it.
somebody jacked my quarter of a million dollar midlife crisis,
I'd be mighty pissed. I'm bringing some of her vics for a chat.
her death may have had something to do with this powder on the controls.
she could have been moonlighting in narcotics.
drug deal gone bad.
I didn't find any trace of it, though, on her skin or her clothes.
then it likely came from the killer.
which puts him inside the car at some point.
be nice if she could just tell us what happened here.
maybe her body can.
mystifying.
what is?
robust 25-year old female.
non-smoker, clearly works out.
overall, the shapely picture of health.
at least she was.
frankly, Sheldon, I'm stumped.
any physical trauma?
Yeah, superficial contusions on the upper abdomen and lateral aspect of the thigh.
while decidedly unpleasant, I'm quite sure that small bruises are not what killed her.
poison?
toxicology was negative across the board.
okay, well, it's not unprecedented for an otherwise healthy young women to have sudden cardiac arrest.
take a look.
there's no indication of arterial sclerosis or heart abnormality.
nothing that would suggest a cardiac episode.
in fact, all of the vital organs, her brain included, are well within normal parameters.
by all accounts, our decedent shouldn't be deceased.
then why the hell is she?
Mr. Rose, you reported your 2009 Ferrari California stolen on July 26?
Yeah, my fault for parking it in such a bad neighborhood.
temporary lapse in judgment.
leaving your keys in the glove box...
that also a lapse in judgment?
I was just going to a party, didn't want to lose them.
I guess leaving them in the car was pretty stupid.
almost as stupid as committing insurance fraud.
just need some water.
should never have bought that expensive car.
just let vanity get the best of me.
ego sometimes clouds our perspective.
Yeah, especially when birthdays start flying by.
Mr. Purdue, we recovered your Ferrari early this morning in a parking lot on the West Side.
was there any damage? - No, the car is fine.
it's the dead body in the trunk that's a problem.
I was at my boyfriend's all night.
I didn't know the car was gone until morning.
the car was registered to your father, not you.
I borrowed it.
Lindsay Without his permission?
I was surprised he even noticed.
he's been a little distracted lately...
ever since he ditched me and my mom for a girlfriend half his age.
so, how did he react when you told him the car had been stolen? - He took it pretty well, I guess.
other than cutting me out of his will and depriving me of my birthright.
that must have made you pretty angry at the people that took the car.
I thought a fancy car would get the attention of some of the ladies.
so I cashed in my savings for the deposit and leased one.
how'd that work out for you? No ladies.
just a mountain of debt.
I just figured if the car got stolen I could use the insurance money to get out from under it.
did you have anyone helping you with this genius plan?
no.
recognize this woman?
never seen her.
can I go now?
I don't think so.
this was taken minutes after your car was stolen.
it's likely she and her associates had been watching you and it for days.
does she look familiar?
no.
I wish I could help you.
the car will be impounded and processed.
once we're through with the investigation, you'll get it back.
I'm not sure I want it back.
mac, is that you?
give me a hand.
you are just full of surprises today.
here's one more:
this hot car is not the hot car we thought it was.
the hidden VIN on the chassis doesn't match the registration.
this is not Nathan Purdue's Ferrari.
then whose car is it?
it was boosted from a Connecticut dealership, about six hours before Danny found our Jane Doe.
thieves put clean VINs on stolen cars so they can resell them.
why would someone put stolen VINs on another stolen car?
lookin' good, JD.
not many people can pull off those coveralls.
I love you, Adam.
did you finish the reconstruction?
Ka-pow!
this baby's good as new.
what is it?
it's a homemade RF cloning device...
tool of choice for this year's technologically discerning car thieves.
now, let me give you guys a demonstration with this handsome American-made vehicle.
all right, keys, please.
come on.
Hey.
now get in.
I can't.
of course you can't, because it's locked, and like any would-be thief, you don't have the keys.
okay, I'm sorry.
okay, most cars have a coded entry system.
now, this gizmo thing fools the receiver by transmitting all one trillion possible codes in rapid succession.
here, check it out.
huh?
the same matched code disengages the engine immobilizer and activates the ignition system.
so, say sayonara to the car and hello, ridiculous insurance premium.
Oh, thanks.
what's that?
AFIS report.
this cloning device was pretty trashed when you found it, and when I was reassembling it, I found a latent on one of the components, and I thought if there was a print in the system, it could tell us who built it and designed it.
prints match an ex-con named Arthur Noonan
nine counts of grand larceny dating all the way back to the late '70s.
also has priors for assault.
a seasoned car thief with a temper.
could have been part of the girls' ring or their competition.
and if the tension between 'em heated up...
could have ended with murder.
go get the keys.
go.
NYPD.
can I help you?
Hi, I'm Detective Flack.
I'm looking for Arthur Noonan.
my beautiful Michelle.
reminds me so much of her mother.
forgive me, but you just don't seem too surprised by her passing.
well, because it's my worst nightmare come true because in many ways, it's my fault.
I'm sorry about your sister.
Michelle wasn't perfect, but she still deserved better than this.
you knew what she was doing?
stealing cars is the family business.
my father, Michelle, my oldest sister Nicole.
they've been doing it since I was a kid.
what about you?
Arthur: Not Audrey.
she chose law school instead.
did you make this for your daughters?
I wish I hadn't.
you could have said no.
those kids were out on the street because I failed them as a father.
would have done anything to make things right between us.
make it right now and give me Nicole's address.
I can't.
Arthur, Michelle's dead, Nicole might know why.
I didn't say I wouldn't,
I said I can't.
I haven't seen or spoken to either one of them in months.
he asked my sisters to stop stealing cars.
he was helping them do it?
Michelle called him a hypocrite and she was right.
that was the last time they spoke to him.
but not to you, Audrey.
Michelle is already gone and your father is a very sick man.
Nicole is the only family you'll have left.
this is your chance to make sure that you don't lose her, too.
I saw them a few weeks back.
we met at a coffee shop in Brooklyn, but they called me.
and I, I have no idea where they were living, I swear.
the family may be fractured, but Michelle and her sister Nicole were extremely close.
Nicole is probably holed up somewhere, distraught over Michelle's death.
or she could be hiding in fear for her own life.
we haven't even actually confirmed that Michelle was murdered.
Sid's doing everything he can to find a C. O.D.
I'm gonna have Flack start canvassing Brooklyn coffee shops with Nicole's photo.
here's the evidence voucher and the joint I confiscated.
I need your signature and we're good to go.
two hours later, huh?
do something wrong, Sarge?
I don't know, you tell me.
no, 'cause I'm pretty sure that issuing a summons to some guy smoking dope in the park is exactly what a cop is supposed to do.
you want to tell that to the units that are forced to cover our sector while we're single-handedly taking down drug cartels half a roach at a time?
so, what, next time I just pretend like I didn't see it?
no, next time, you stop and you think and you use your training and discretion to determine what's the best use of your time and that of your supervising officer.
this uniform you're wearing makes you accountable for your actions, and mine makes me responsible for 15 officers, and when they mess the bed, that's my problem.
because of your decision, we're sitting here paper-jockeying vouchers instead of being out there on our shift where the real criminals are.
that means overtime and that I might not see my kid and my wife tonight.
I didn't consider all that.
next time you will.
run this over to the property clerk.
I'll see you outside.
go ahead, Mac, say it.
tell me I handled that wrong and I got a lot to learn before I become a good boss.
I think you handled that like a seasoned pro, Danny, and I think you're already a good boss.
serious?
Yeah, come a hell of a long way since those first couple of years in the lab.
that was a long time ago.
I still feel like I got a lot to learn, though.
Ah, trust your instincts, don't beat yourself up if things don't always come out the way you intended.
and good luck with the drug cartels.
all right.
it's an extracellular matrix composed of fibrous proteins, namely collagen.
the glue that holds the body together.
this stuff is specifically engineered to promote rapid tissue regrowth.
I've read the research on similar compounds.
the applications are endless
surgical wounds, severe burns, ulcers.
someday it may even grow body parts.
where did this sample come from? There are dozens of labs working on regenerative technology.
I should be able to narrow it down.
it'll just take some time. Stay on it.
I can't breathe!
oxygen... Is it working?
gentlemen, should I be concerned?
perfect timing, Mac.
we looked into possible causes for the bruising on Michelle Moore's body, and I think we found the culprit. Krav Maga.
HAWKES: Translated as "battle combat.
it originated in Hungary as an extremely efficient defensive fighting technique.
I'm familiar with it.
it's standard training for many soldiers around the world.
then you know it's all about neutralizing your opponent as quickly as possible.
targeting the most vulnerable points.
but in this case, the bruising was on the victim's thigh and abdomen.
Yes, perfectly logical targets if the attacker had a specific agenda.
and advanced knowledge of Krav Maga pressure points.
gall bladder 31.
a kick here will render the leg useless.
conception vessel 15.
a blow here will make the diaphragm spasm, causing difficulty breathing and severe pain.
she was deliberately paralyzed and made to suffer.
our perp is the total package-- cold, calculating, sadistic.
Hey.
he's gone. You can get up now.
SID: What exactly are we looking for?
the smoking gun.
these are myocardiocyteal cells from Michelle's heart.
take a look.
SID: The contours of the nuclei are stretched and narrowed.
precisely what happens when cells are introduced to electricity.
our C. O.D. was electrocution.
the charge was delivered through her leather jacket.
that's why there were no burns on the skin.
what are you thinking for a murder weapon?
something efficient, easy to conceal. Like a stun gun.
they don't produce nearly the 0. 1 amps needed to stop the heart.
but if modified, a stun gun could deliver its full charge in one fatal burst.
at the risk of sounding a bit envious,
I do have to ask, how did you figure out electric shock?
I think I know who killed her.
our suspect is Dominik Janos.
why does that name sound so familiar?
cause FBI and Interpol have been chasing him since the early '90s. He's become a ghost.
with Janos, fact and fiction are easily blurred.
what's he wanted for?
everything from drug and weapons charges to human trafficking.
so why are we liking him for a murdered car thief?
DANVILLE: Janos was arrested at 14 for brutally attacking a cop after being arrested for shoplifting.
he spent five years in a prison outside Budapest where he learned Krav Maga.
after his release, three of the cop's family members were found murdered, all of them had their tracheas crushed by a single strike to the throat.
this guy's insane.
Janos vanished for a few years, later turned up in Colombia as a Medellin enforcer providing us with the only other known photo of him.
his specialty was electric shock because of the efficiency and extreme pain it causes.
it also gave him the knowledge and know-how to easily turn a stun gun into a killing machine.
how is this guy still free after all these years?
there must be eyewitnesses reports, a physical description.
his complex aliases and altered appearances made them all unreliable and inconsistent.
like the accounts of his death two years ago.
the yacht he was on reportedly caught fire and sank, taking everyone down with it.
well, a dead man didn't kill Michelle.
no, but maybe a burned man did.
the regenerative powder.
he's using it to regrow scar tissue.
transferred it to the controls in the Ferrari.
then why take the time to turn on the radio and air conditioner?
nothing is random with Janos. Whatever it was, he had a good reason for getting into that car.
Michelle might have known what it was and that's why he killed her.
and Nicole might know, too.
even if Janos just thinks she does, Nicole is in serious danger.
and so is her family.
police.
Mr. Noonan?! Audrey?!
Arthur, it's Detective Flack.
it's too late. Janos was already here.
FLACK: Neighbors didn't hear anything.
paratransit company says they drove Audrey and her father directly home from the precinct.
Janos could have already been here waiting.
any sign of the girl?
not yet.
victim's been dead no more than six hours.
no physical trauma except for two small contact burns on his chest. Same stun gun?
this time applied directly to the skin, not through a leather jacket.
I also found paint chips on the carpet from this window right here.
FLACK: Window frame's painted shut.
somebody tried to get it open, but couldn't.
Audrey tried to run.
and hide. Found this underneath the bed.
she was dialing 911.
Yeah. Perp must have caught her before she could hit send.
these are her fingernail marks on the carpet.
FLACK: Twistedfreakdragged her out by her ankles.
if we haven't found a body, maybe Audrey's still alive.
Janos would have killed her right away, if that was his intention.
he took her for a reason.
some kind of ransom?
or leverage against the only family member left-- Nicole.
Hey, Cooper...
Sarge.
listen, about before...
no, I, I deserved what I got.
I was a bit out of line.
shaving my head would've been out of line, but what happened earlier, that was just you teaching me how to be better.
as long as I didn't push you too hard.
you don't have to worry about me.
I'm much tougher than I look.
truth is, you're gonna be a great cop.
and that's more than anyone ever said about me when I was starting out.
did you make as many mistakes as me?
twice as many.
I was impulsive, I was arrogant, I thought I knew everything.
eh, you know, some things never change.
all right, now take it easy, rookie-- but I want you to keep doing what you're doing, okay?
mistakes and all.
cause that's the only way you ever really learn.
as long as you promise not to pull any punches the next time I do drop the ball.
that's easy enough. Deal.
Hey, Sarge... Yeah.
me and some of the guys are gonna go get couple beers, and there's always room at the table for one more screw-up.
I gotta head home.
maybe next time.
Nicole Moore is back on the radar.
two more Ferraris reported stolen over the last four hours.
two family members dead and one missing, and it's business as usual?
not exactly.
both cars were taken by force in plain sight of eyewitnesses and surveillance cameras.
her M. O. has completely changed.
why is she so desperate to steal these particular cars?
Hey, I just got off Skype with a biotech firm in Denver.
they've been working on a wound powder-- it's designed specifically to regrow skin that's been damaged by burns, but it's not for sale yet.
there are a hundred different ways Janos could have gotten some.
I'm not sure if this helps, but there's a pretty significant list of side effects.
what kind of side effects?
where do I start?
shooting pain, bacterial infection, light sensitivity.
light sensitivity.
I never should have bought such an expensive car.
I just let vanity get the best of me.
sometimes ego clouds our perspective.
especially when birthdays start flying by.
we had him.
Nathan Purdue is Dominik Janos.
and now he knows we're onto him.
I spoke to the Bureau.
they've been investigating Purdue for months.
it turns out his textile importexport business is a cover for a money-laundering operation based in the Caymans.
why the hell didn't they share that information with us?
they didn't make the Janos connection till we made it for them.
what about Purdue's background check?
it came out clean, because on the surface it was.
he had ties to the community, supports local charities.
he's been in New York less than two years.
coincides with the sinking of his yacht.
so everyone thinks Janos is dead, and he reinvents himself as a successful businessman.
allows him to hide in plain sight while he's convalescing from any injuries he might have sustained in the fire.
Michelle and Nicole's biggest mistake wasn't stealing a car, it was stealing the wrong car.
crossing Janos put a target on their backs.
Janos could buy a hundred sports cars if he wanted to.
why would he risk exposing his true identity by going after this one?
what if it's not the car he wants, but what's hidden inside?
whatever it is, it must be worth it.
we gotta find it before he does.
to do that, we got to find Nicole first.
easier said than done.
one of the cars that Nicole jacked earlier today was fitted with a vehicle recovery system.
15 minutes after the car was stolen from here,
ACD activated the transreceiver and the black-and-white picked up the signal here.
they spotted her, tried to pull her over.
TAYLOR: Tried?
ross: She ditched them in traffic before the chopper got there.
another unit picked up the signal in Brooklyn, but they lost it before they could locate the car.
I mean, she could be anywhere right now.
where in Brooklyn?
right here. Fourth and Union.
DANVILLE: That's three blocks from the coffee shop where Audrey met her sisters.
they must have a garage nearby.
this is Mac Taylor.
I want every available air and ground unit equipped with a vehicle recovery receiver routed to Brooklyn right away.
if that car is still in the area, we're gonna find it.
officer: Clear!
clear! Clear!
officer: Look upstairs!
officer 2: All clear, Detective.
FLACK: Nobody's here.
there's an apartment upstairs.
must have been where Nicole and Michelle were living.
VINs match.
this is Purdue's real stolen Ferrari.
at least some of it.
what if they dismantled the car before they knew who the owner was?
then they find out Purdue is Janos and that he wants it back?
then it's too late. Car's already been chopped.
it's a list of auto parts.
most of them are crossed off.
she could be rebuilding his car using original components.
as a trade for Audrey.
exactly.
the second Janos gets that thing back, he'll kill them both.
there are still a few pieces not crossed off on this list.
the parts she's still after?
it's difficult to fence parts from such high-end exotics.
the girls must have had a network of black market dealers that were working for them.
it would have been a fight for her to get back the parts that are still on those dealers' shelves.
damn near impossible to retrieve the parts that have already been sold.
she'd have to steal them back.
if we can find out who bought those parts and what cars they've been installed on, we've narrowed down her next target.
we just have to beat her to it.
police! Do not move! NYPD! Don't move!
it's over, Nicole!
you just killed my sister.
you're wasting time.
Audrey needs help now.
Nicole, we're gonna help your sister, you have my word.
you need to calm down and answer my questions.
sit down.
take a seat!
when did you learn that you'd stolen from Dominik Janos?
the morning after.
we'd already chopped his car and distributed the parts to shops around town.
and Michelle wanted to run, lay low for awhile...
...but I'd heard the ghost stories.
there's no hiding from that monster, and it was too late to give him back his 458, so we decided to give him one that looked just like it.
our plan was for Michelle to show him the car, while I stayed hidden.
something went wrong; I was supposed to go for help.
I froze...
praying he would just drive away.
but, somehow, he knew we had tried to trick him.
where is my car?
she couldn't tell him because she didn't know.
it happened so fast.
there was nothing I could do.
I walked away.
and I waited...
a few minutes.
then I ran.
and I should... I should've done more, but...
I should've tried to help her.
if you had, you'd be dead now, too.
I knew it was just a matter of time before he came after me, so I went straight back to the garage, and I waited, and when my cell rang, I knew it was him calling.
only Michelle had my number.
he had her phone. By then, he'd already killed your father and kidnapped Audrey.
he said I had 24 hours to return his car
his whole car
with every original part, or he'd kill her.
where are you supposed to bring it?
he said he was gonna call back with instructions, but now...
please... I chose this life, and I'm prepared to answer for that, but Audrey never asked to be a part of this family business, and now, because of me, she could lose her life.
and, so, please...
...Let me try and save her.
let me bring that car back to Janos.
that's exactly what we're gonna do.
JANOS: West Side Highway to Tenth Avenue.
there's an empty lot under the bridge.
TAYLOR: Do as he says. We'll be close behind.
JANOS: Stop, but leave the engine running.
get out and take 15 steps.
keep your back to the car at all times.
your sister will be nearby.
do as you're told.
once I drive away, you'll both be free to go.
bitch!
what's the matter, Janos?
look like you've seen a ghost.
you okay?
never better.
officer: Get down on the ground! What about Audrey?
still looking.
Hey, Mac! Jo!
over here!
Janos transferred powder to three buttons
the radio...
the thermostat, and the hazard lights.
he installed a hidden trap.
Ah, forged passports, credit cards, birth certificate
everything Janos needs to get out of the country.
FBI and Interpol would have to start over at square one.
he found out the Feds were onto the Purdue alias, and knew his window for escape was closing.
he needed a final disappearing act.
well, that's why he had everything in the car, in case they searched his office and apartment.
must've been days away from running.
after the car was stolen, he didn't have time to get new documents.
that's why he was desperate to get 'em back.
the uncatchable Dominik Janos brought down by a family of car thieves.
I always tell my kids the only reason evil exists in the world is so that good can triumph over it.
well, if it didn't, we'd be out of a job.
Sarge!
glad you could make it out.
what the hell do you rookies think you're doing?
want to move over a little bit, or I'm gonna let you stand?
I'm just kidding. I'm joking.
it's good to see you, Sarge.

I don't know, Toombs. Looks kinda tight.
not where I'm sittin'. This is the biggest payday ever,
so throw on a fresh pair of panties. Let's get this right.
three meters clearance port-side. One anda halfmeters starboard.
we got a choke point comin' up.
what the shit was that?
tags, you got eyes on Riddick?
tags?
Jesus.
he just ghosted two guys, and I never even saw him.
what doyou think, Toombs? I mean, maybe we oughta just-- I thinkyou're my new gunner.
grab a Gat.
stay on top ofhim this time.
[Man] You made three mistakes.
first, you took the job.
second, you came light.
a four-man crewforme? Fuckin' insulting.
but the worst mistakeyou made
empty gun rack.
what's the bounty on my head? - One mil.
One-point-five. - What slam pays 1. 5 for a convict?
private party.
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Guy, guy! Easy! Anonymous.
that's what the sheet said. - What planet?
Helion Prime.
whoa. Where you goin'? Last question.
and you better get this one right, merc.
whose ship is this?
mine?
[Riddick Narrating] Knew they'dcome forme.
took 'em fiveyears, but I knew.
you don't expect these mercs to have any honor, any code.
but this new bounty from a holy man, a guy whose neck I saved
well, lesson learned.
no such word as "friend. '
can only end bad when you let someone get too close.
[ Chuckles ] Bad for them.
so now it's back to all the brightness... and everything I hate.
wonder ifshe 'll be there.
act like an animal and I'm gonna slot you up like one. This one is always in trouble.
I knew it! I smell it.
get in there!
can we shut the goddamn noise?
[ riddick ] Theysay most ofyour brain shuts down in cryosleep.
[ woman's Voice, Distorted] Brain shuts down in cryosleep.
[ riddick ] All but the primitive side. - [ Woman ] All but the primitive side.
[ riddick ] The animal side.
[ woman ] All but the Furyan side.
som e of us sti I l remem ber the true cri me that happened here on Furya.
and once you wake
truly wake
you'll remember too.
[ crashing] -] [ Woman Over Radio ] Helion Prime is on alert condition four.
[ man Over Radio ] Unrecognized craft. You need to follow me to Spaceport Six for security inspections.
Hey! Do you hear me?
follow me to Spaceport Six now!
I mam, pray for us.
[ woman ] It was confirmed two seasons back. Yes.
[ woman #2 ] They're coming here. I mean, are we next?
[ man ] Militants storm
[ woman #3 ] Yes. But going to the underground shelters ifit happens
[ man #2] You're right. That's what I thought too.
[ man #3 ] Are you staying or leaving?
[ man #4 ] It's the end ofeverything. Everything!
[ man #5 ] Well, my neighbors-- [ Man #6 ] Halfmy street is gone.
what are we gonna do? I don't know. I don't know.
[ woman #4 ] Hood ofthe devil. That's what someone called 'em.
them? Who is them? Some kind of new creature
this is nonsense. It's all nonsense.
[Man #7] So tall that it touches the clouds.
and there's nothing around this statue, this colossus. Nothing left.
it's their calling card.
[Riddick] Didyou know allyour doors were locked?
fiveyears ago,
I took two people offthat planet
a kid, Jack, who everyone else thought was a boy;
and a holy man...
searching for New Mecca.
your wife
she's i n the shower.
I told one man...
where I m ight go.
I showed trust to one man.
did I make a mistake, I mam?
there is no simple answer.
whateverwas said was meant to give us a chance
a fighting chance.
were it not for the threat ofinvasion, I neverwould have betrayed you.
I giveyou myword, Riddick. Riddick!
Riddick!
[Riddick] Anda daughter...
No! - whose name would be
ifyou have issue with me, you let it be with me.
you need not know their names. [ Girl] Ziza.
my name is Ziza.
Ziza.
cute kid. - Didyou reallykill monsters?
the ones that were gonna hurt my father?
such are our bedtime stories.
go, Ziza. Go on!
so now who do I have to kill to get this payday off my head?
it is said the comet always precedes them
these world-enders.
the Coalsack planets are gone.
eight million settlers missing.
the entire Aquilan System is gone too.
Helion Prime shares its sunlight with all worlds nearby.
ifwe fall, they fall.
and after that
my God, how do I save my family?
haveyou heardanything I've said?
you said it's all circling the drain-- the whole universe.
right? That's right.
had to end sometime.
[ arabic ]
[ arabic ]
the oneyou want is now here.
and whose throat is this?
ifyou cut my throat, I'll not be able to rescind the offer that broughtyou here.
nor tell you why it's so vital thatyou did come.
the blade comes off when the bounty comes off.
this is Aereon, an envoy from the Elemental race.
she means you no harm.
there are very few of us who have met a Necromonger and lived to speak of it.
so when I choose to speak ofit, you should choose to listen.
Necromonger.
it is the name that will convert or kill every last human life...
unless the universe can rebalance itself.
maybe you should pretend like you're talkin' to someone educated in the penal system.
in fact, don't pretend.
balance is everything to elementals.
water to fire. Earth to air.
we have 33 different words for it.
but now we have only time to speak of the balance of opposites.
there is a story, Riddick, ofyoung male Furyans...
strangled at birth
strangled with their own cords.
when Aereon told this story to the Helion leaders,
I told her ofyou.
what do you know ofyour earlyyears? - Doyou rememberyour home world?
where it was? - Haveyou met any others?
others likeyourself.
sister, they don't know what to do with just one of me. - [Knocking]
[Man ] Open up in there! [Knocking Continues ]
stand back! - Open up!
they are searching houses! Shh!
they look for a man who came here today. They think he might be a spy.
a spy? Did someone see him come here today?
did they? Lajjun, stop!
we're sure he's in there! I will send them away. But wait one minute, please.
willyou wait one minute to save worlds?
not my fight.
so, you will leave us to our fate, just likeyou did her.
[Man ] Break it down! [Banging]
get him!
come. Let us try to send them away.
[Man ] Move it. Come on. [Lajjun ] Leave us alone!
there is no one here! [ Cries Out ]
[Man ] You don't understand. He can help us! He can help us!
go!
you're not afraid of the dark, are you?
get him! - Where is he?
I n there!
you mentioned her.
she, uh-]-]
she went looking foryou.
people died. She went to prison.
I-- I don't rememberwhere.
but it was a world so hot you not survive on the surface.
Crematoria. Young Jack.
she thought ofyou as her older brother.
she worshipped you. You were supposed to watch her.
she neverforgaveyou...
for leaving just when she needed you most.
she needed to stay away from me. You all do.
Riddick.
are you gonna stop the new monsters now?
Furyans. Defiant to the end.
no, no.
we go to the shelter.
we take only ourselves.
stay close.
No! - [People Shrieking]
[Man ] Flight leaders, get allsquads offthe ground now.
we have heavyinbound.
follow me in!
the next shelter. This way!
Yeah!
Whoo-hoo!
I 'll see if it's safe.
stay back! -] Come, Ziza.
come!
you following me?
Lajjun and Ziza!
when it's over. Let me go. I must get to my family!
when it's over.
I borroweda ship.
you can ride along, ifyou don't mind riding with a convict.
I thankyou, but I must get my family across the river.
God willing, there is still a shelter I can get them
I'm sure God has his tricks, but getting out ofplaces no one else can, that's one of mine.
let's get your family.
Aah!
in here.
get in.
Shh.
] Imam! - Don't follow me.
there will be an afterlife for me.
will there be foryou?
let's go replenish the ranks.
each time a dynasty falls.
rememberyour place, Dame Vaako.
my place is atyour side, dear husband.
from here till UnderVerse come.
in this 'verse,
Iife is antagonistic to the natural state.
here, humans in all theirvarious races...
are a spontaneous outbreak
an unguided mistake.
our purpose...
is to correct that mistake.
because there is another 'verse
a 'verse where life is welcomed and cherished.
a ravishing, ever-newplace called UnderVerse.
but the road to that 'verse...
crosses over the threshold.
threshold! Take us to the threshold!
what you call... death.
[muttering] So it is this 'verse that must be cleansed oflife, so that UnderVerse can populate and prosper.
look aroundyou. Every Necromonger in this hall, every one of the Legion Vast that just swept aside your defenses in one night...
was once like you.
fought as feebly as you.
every Necromonger that lives today...
is a convert.
there'll be no conversions! - We all began as something else!
it was hard for me to accept, too, when I first heard these words.
but I changed.
I let them take away my pain.
you betrayed your faith! -Just as you will change...
whenyou realize that the threshold to the UnderVerse will be crossed...
for those ofyou who wi I l ri ght now...
we will not renounce our faith! No one here will do what you ask.
it is unthinkable!
this is a worldofmanypeoples, manyreligions!
and we simply cannot and will not be converted!
[ gasps ] Then I'll take your soul.
join him... -[Body Thuds ]
or join me.
this is your one chance.
take the Lord Marshal's offer and bow.
I bow to no man.
he's not a man.
he's the holy Half-Dead who has seen the UnderVerse.
look, I'm not with everyone here.
but I will take a piece ofhim.
a pieceyou will have.
stop him!
Irgun. One of my best.
ifyou say so.
what doyou think ofthis blade?
I think it's a half-gram heavy on the back end.
in our faith, you keep whatyou kill.
areyou familiarto me?
Havewe met on some distant field?
you'd think I'd remember.
you'd think I would too.
take him before the Quasi-Deads.
perhaps the breeder would do it...
ifsomebodyjust asked him.
it is a rare offer.
a visit inside Necropolis.
it's been a long time since I smelled beautiful.
let me showyou theway.
beautiful eyes.
come.
the last six Lord Marshals have called this home.
magnificent, isn't it?
I might have gone a different way. True of us all.
converts receiving the mark ofthe Necromonger.
they learn how one pain can lessen another.
there now.
that is just... perfect.
the more you resist them, the greater the damage will be.
[Female Voice Whispering] A new one.
you've brought us the one.
I nteresting breeder.
[ whispering Continues ] Making entry.
this won't take long. - [ Groani ng ]
we've entered his neocortex.
Ahh! The Riddick! - Regress.
[ female Voice ] Scanning fresh memories.
thoughts ofsomeone calledJack.
Riddick!
[ imam ] She went to prison.
[ female Voice ] Now we find thoughts ofan Elemental.
the one race that would slow the spread ofNecromongers.
Furyans. - [ Female Voice ] Furyans.
where does he come from?
who are his people? These are the things I need to know.
[ female Voice ] We find energy.
[ woman's Voice ] You must settle yourpast.
[ gasps ] - [ Female Voice ] We find Furyan energy.
for all ofus. - [ Female Voice ] He 's Furyan!
Furyan!
a Furyan survivor!
[ woman ] Look at our world, at the graves ofthose who didn 't escape 30 years ago.
there is no future until we settle our past...
for all ofus who bear the mark.
[ female Voice ] Kill the Furyan! Kill the Riddick!
kill the Riddick! Kill the Riddick! Kill the Riddick!
kill the Riddick! Ki I l the Ri ddi ck.
who i s this man?
fi nd hi m. Whatever it takes. Fi nd hi m!
let me guess. A five-man crew this time.
couple of things you could have done better.
first, trash the locator beacon inside my ship-- the oneyou jacked.
Andsecond--and this is really the more important part
dust my dick when you get the chance.
any questions? - Yeah.
what tookyou so long?
let's go, big boy.
I n and out, unsuspected and undetected. Damn, I love a good smash-and-grab.
not so fast. Not so fast.
dickheads. We're pickin' up fields here.
[Female Computer Voice ] Unknown fields detected on hull.
I knew it. Here it comes. This is some kind of scan.
I don't know. Readin' our Btus, maybe?
let's drop one. - Dropping.
[Female Computer Voice ] Decoylaunched.
[Female Computer Voice ] Preparing to engage ion drive. So, where do we drop your merc-killin' ass?
who's gonna pay the most foryou now?
butcher Bay? - Butcher Bay.
ten minutes every other day on the dog run.
protein waffles aren't bad.
Hey, how 'bout Ursa Luna? Nice little double-max prison.
they keep a cell open for me... just in case I drop in.
you knowthe problem with thesejoints now?
maybe we should think about uppin' our game here a little bit.
think about someplace truly diabolical.
what the hell is he thinkin' now?
[Riddick] He's thinkin'a triple-maxprison.
a no-daylight slam. Onlythree of'em left in this system
two of 'em outta range for a shitty little undercutter like this one with no legs.
leavin' just... one
Crematoria.
that is what you had in mind, right, Toombs?
Hey, how does he know where we're goin', and we don't? - Dope it out.
I hate this run. -Just do it!
don't know about this new crew ofyours.
they seem a bit skittish.
probably shouldn't tell 'em what happened to the last crew.
you know, you supposed to be some slick-shit killer.
now look atyou
Isaywe attack Helion Two next.
take it straight into their teeth.
it'll costyou 20, 000 heads, five warrior ships. Nothing more, I swear it.
while I do prize brute force, this approach is perhaps more artful.
start at the end.
go straight to Helion Five, the last planet in the system.
we approach from the night side.
remove these cannon first, then attack the larger placements at speed.
we'll catch them on theirrearflank. And in ten days'time, the rest ofthose worlds will tumble before us.
you see, as with most, their blind spot...
is right behind them.
I've located an ion trail which leads off-world.
then you should be off-]world, Vaako.
I've deployed a tracker team. One ofthe best.
wherever Riddick has gone, you lens him out and cleanse him.
you. - You want me to take a frigate for one breeder?
don't question it, Vaako!
take it on faith.
he's always been unsettled around you
the Lord Marshal.
unsteady.
perhaps because he knows he's halfthe warrioryou are.
some sayhe's too artistic forthejob.
I wouldn't be surprised if someone promoted him soon...
to full dead.
take care what you say.
should I say it softly?
so it sounds more like conspiracy?
Oh, why is it that when anyone breathes about the demise ofhim on the throne...
everyone assumes a conspiracy?
why isn't that just prudent planning?
when he is ready, he will name a successor.
who?
Toal? Scales? The Purifier?
none ofthem...
with the strength, the dignity, of Lord Vaako.
you can keep whatyou kill.
stop. - That is the Necromongerway.
I said... stop. [ Grunts ]
his death will come in due time and not a moment sooner.
Why? - Because I serve him. We all serve him. It's called fidelity.
it's called stupidity.
well, finally some attention.
you have such greatness in you.
if onlyyou could see it like I do.
you know what I want?
today I came up behind him in perfect silence and he knew.
I wanna go down in Necropolis.
right now.
his half-dead soul sensed I was behind him. He sees everything.
when no one is looking
when no one's around
I'm gonna get down on my knees...
[ lord Marshal ] How unexpected. - An Elemental.
here. One ofthe captives.
[Lord Marshal] And why, after 30years, should it be you?
he doesn't regard her as a captive, though.
Elementals-- theytalk ofneutrality, but they're all witches andspies.
why else would they come and go like the wind?
but where has he gone? Where is the Furyan hiding now?
you be the good warrior.
go after this Riddick.
I'll find out why the Lord Marshal is so threatened by him.
[Panting] Doyou know you grind your teeth at night?
sexy.
[Female Computer Voice ] Destination reached.
unlocking manual controls.
all right. I make 700 degrees on the day side, 300 below on the night side.
let's not get caught in the sun.
if I owned this place and hell,
I'd rent this place out and live in hell.
[Female Computer Voice ] Blue angle... good. - Stand by.
and
[Female Computer Voice ] Plotted course good.
hit it!
[ female Computer Voice ] Angle ofapproach, not good.
[ Laughi ng ] -] Look, Ma. No hands!
party poppers!
skittish, Toombs. Very skittish.
comfy?
when the ride's over, your goggles are mine.
four-way split! [ Laughing ]
29. 4 kilometers.
so, this is Riddick.
what in the bowels ofChrist areyou talkin' about, 700K?
don't take this one, boss.
see? Anatoli here has a nose for trouble.
and this one, this Riddick guy
big, big trouble.
so, 700, 000 is good money.
I'd take the money, Toombs.
[Clanging] The guild pays us a caretaker's fee for each prisoner each year.
we pay mercs 20% ofthat total fee based on a certain life expectancy.
how's about this?
you open that safe you got hidden behind the console there, show me the real books, then we figure out my cut.
then I'll be on my way.
open my books. This is whatyou suggest?
wasn't a suggestion.
these are dangerous days, ifyou believe the talk.
t al k? About dead planets.
about some ghost army.
about them.
them"? [ Scoffs ]
I 'll run the numbers again.
it takes a couple of days, probably, so you can stay as my guest.
at least here, we are all safe.
yes? [Man ] Yes, boss.
I'll give it a day.
one.
[Man ] There are inmates...
and there are convicts.
a convict has a certain code.
and he knows to show a certain respect.
an inmate, on the other hand, pulls the pin on his fellow man.
does the guards' work for them.
brings shame... -] [ Shouts ]
to the game.
so, which are you gonna be?
me?
I'm just passin' through.
welcome to Crematoria.
should I go for the sweet spot?
left ofthe spine, fourth lumbar down, the abdominal aorta.
what a gusher.
how do I get eyes like that?
you gotta kill a few people.
[ Chuckles ] Did that.
did a lot ofthat.
and then you gotta get sent to a slam. One where they tell you you'll never see daylight again?
only there wasn't any doctor here who could shine my eyes, not even for 20 menthol Kools.
was there anything you said that was true?
what areyou gonna do, huh? Go for the sweet spot?
rememberwho you're talkin' to, Jack.
Jack's dead. She was weak.
she couldn't cut it.
the name's Kyra now.
and I'm a new animal.
they can be quite a test, these deep runs
tests of our inner selves.
don'tyou find that true?
let's go find a wild stallion to tame.
ready? - 30 seconds.
come on, come on.
we're in.
10, 000 cars were stolen in New York City last year.
all right, that's 28 a day.
early this year, auto crime division identified a ring specializing in luxury imports.
and now they're only stealing Ferraris.
16 of 'em in eight weeks.
suspects are female.
mid-to-late 20s, one blonde, one brunette.
beyond that, details are sketchy.
so far, they've avoided surveillance cameras and most eyewitnesses.
they target vehicles parked on the street, and they're able to bypass the most advanced security systems.
these girls are good, but they've been lucky.
all right, you got your shift assignments.
let's get out of here, let's be safe.
this is the fifth one we've checked out tonight.
Yes, it is. You want to tell me why?
cause stolen cars with theft recovery devices emit a tracking signal, but the battery only lasts three days.
thief stashes the vehicle, walks away.
if it hasn't been found by the time he gets back...
probably never will.
whoa, whoa, stop, stop, stop.
engine's still running on that car. You know what to do?
keep our eyes open, stay in the blind spots.
Hey, Mac.
so, ACD confirms the vehicle was stolen two nights ago, and, uh, DOT checked local traffic cameras.
guess who likes to run red lights?
the victim's one of our elusive car thieves.
we have a name? - She had no I. D. on her.
what do you think?
that photo puts her behind the wheel.
now we got to figure out who put her in the trunk.
we got powder flecks on some of the controls knobs inside, and some kind of crushed electronic device outside, but other than that, I can say this is officially the cleanest Ferrari I've ever been in.
and how many is that?
well, it depends if you're talking stock or race modified.
checked with lot security.
guard did a walk-through two hours ago. Ferrari wasn't here yet.
narrows our time frame.
car could have been dumped here with her already in the trunk.
boosting cars is a dangerous game.
but a really lucrative one.
a car like this, on the black market, would sell for a fortune.
and even more if you sell the parts individually.
and why would it still be sitting here?
he may not have killed her for the car, but simply because she stole it.
somebody jacked my quarter of a million dollar midlife crisis, I'd be mighty pissed.
I'm bringing some of her vics for a chat.
her death may have had something to do with this powder on the controls.
she could have been moonlighting in narcotics.
drug deal gone bad.
I didn't find any trace of it, though, on her skin or her clothes.
then it likely came from the killer.
which puts him inside the car at some point.
be nice if she could just tell us what happened here.
maybe her body can.
mystifying.
what is?
robust 25-year old female. Non-smoker, clearly works out.
overall, the shapely picture of health.
at least she was.
frankly, Sheldon, I'm stumped.
any physical trauma?
Yeah, superficial contusions on the upper abdomen and lateral aspect of the thigh.
while decidedly unpleasant, I'm quite sure that small bruises are not what killed her.
poison?
toxicology was negative across the board.
okay, well, it's not unprecedented for an otherwise healthy young women to have sudden cardiac arrest.
take a look.
there's no indication of arterial sclerosis or heart abnormality.
nothing that would suggest a cardiac episode.
in fact, all of the vital organs, her brain included, are well within normal parameters.
by all accounts, our decedent shouldn't be deceased.
then why the hell is she?
Mr. Rose, you reported your 2009 Ferrari California stolen on July 26?
Yeah, my fault for parking it in such a bad neighborhood.
temporary lapse in judgment.
leaving your keys in the glove box-- that also a lapse in judgment?
I was just going to a party, didn't want to lose them.
I guess leaving them in the car was pretty stupid.
almost as stupid as committing insurance fraud.
just need some water.
should never have bought that expensive car.
just let vanity get the best of me.
ego sometimes clouds our perspective.
Yeah, especially when birthdays start flying by.
Mr. Purdue, we recovered your Ferrari early this morning in a parking lot on the West Side.
was there any damage? - No, the cais fe.
it's the dead body in the trunk that's a problem.
I was at my boyfriend's all night.
I didn't know the car was gone until morning.
the car was registered to your father, not you.
I borrowed it.
without his permission?
I was surprised he even noticed.
he's been a little distracted lately-- ever since he ditched me and my mom for a girlfriend half his age.
how did he react when you told him the car had been stolen?
he took it pretty well, I guess.
other than cutting me out of his will and depriving me of my birthright.
that must have made you pretty angry at the people that took the car.
I thought a fancy car would get the attention of some of the ladies.
so I cashed in my savings for the deposit and leased one.
how'd that work out for you?
no ladies. Just a mountain of debt.
I just figured if the car got stolen I could use the insurance money to get out from under it.
did you have anyone helping you with this genius plan?
no.
recognize this woman?
never seen her.
can I go now? - I don't think so.
this was taken minutes after your car was stolen.
it's likely she and her associates had been watching you and it for days.
does she look familiar?
no. I wish I could help you.
the car will be impounded and processed.
once we're through with the investigation, you'll get it back.
I'm not sure I want it back.
mac, is that you?
give me a hand.
you are just full of surprises today.
here's one more: This hot car is not the hot car we thought it was.
the hidden VIN on the chassis doesn't match the registration.
this is not Nathan Purdue's Ferrari.
then whose car is it?
it was boosted from a Connecticut dealership, about six hours before Danny found our Jane Doe.
thieves put clean VINs on stolen cars so they can resell them.
why would someone put stolen VINs on another stolen car?
lookin' good, JD.
not many people can pull off those coveralls.
I love you, Adam.
did you finish the reconstruction?
Ka-pow! This baby's good as new.
what is it?
it's a homemade RF cloning device-- tool of choice for this year's technologically discerning car thieves.
now, let me give you guys a demonstration with this handsome American-made vehicle.
all right, keys, please.
come on.
now get in.
I can't.
of course you can't, because it's locked, and like any would-be thief, you don't have the keys.
Adam. - Okay, I'm sorry.
okay, most cars have a coded entry system.
now, this gizmo thing fools the receiver by transmitting all one trillion possible codes in rapid succession.
here, check it out.
the same matched code disengages the engine immobilizer and activates the ignition system.
so, say sayonara to the car and hello, ridiculous insurance premium.
Oh, thanks.
what's that? - AFIS report.
this cloning device was pretty trashed when you found it, and when I was reassembling it, I found a latent on one of the components, and I thought if there was a print in the system, it could tell us who built it and designed it.
prints match an ex-con named Arthur Noonan
nine counts of grand larceny dating all the way back to the late '70s.
also has priors for assault.
a seasoned car thief with a temper.
could have been part of the girls' ring or their competition.
and if the tension between 'em heated up...
could have ended with murder.
go get the keys.
go.
NYPD.
can I help you?
Hi, I'm Detective Flack. I'm looking for Arthur Noonan.
you're here about my daughters, aren't you?
my beautiful Michelle.
reminds me so much of her mother.
forgive me, but you just don't seem too surprised by her passing.
well, because it's my worst nightmare come true because in many ways, it's my fault.
I'm sorry about your sister.
Michelle wasn't perfect, but she still deserved better than this.
you knew what she was doing?
stealing cars is the family business.
my father, Michelle, my oldest sister Nicole.
they've been doing it since I was a kid.
what about you?
not Audrey. She chose law school instead.
did you make this for your daughters?
I wish I hadn't. - You could have said no.
those kids were out on the street because I failed them as a father.
would have done anything to make things right between us.
make it right now and give me Nicole's address.
I can't.
Arthur, Michelle's dead, Nicole might know why.
I didn't say I wouldn't, I said I can't.
I haven't seen or spoken to either one of them in months.
he asked my sisters to stop stealing cars.
he was helping them do it?
Michelle called him a hypocrite and she was right.
that was the last time they spoke to him.
but not to you, Audrey.
Michelle is already gone and your father is a very sick man.
Nicole is the only family you'll have left.
this is your chance to make sure that you don't lose her, too.
I saw them a few weeks back.
we met at a coffee shop in Brooklyn, but they called me.
and I, I have no idea where they were living, I swear.
the family may be fractured, but Michelle and her sister Nicole were extremely close.
Nicole is probably holed up somewhere, distraught over Michelle's death.
or she could be hiding in fear for her own life.
we haven't even actually confirmed that Michelle was murdered.
Sid's doing everything he can to find a C. O.D.
I'm gonna have Flack start canvassing Brooklyn coffee shops with Nicole's photo.
here's the evidence voucher and the joint I confiscated.
I need your signature and we're good to go.
two hours later, huh?
do something wrong, Sarge? - I don't know, you tell me.
no,'cause I'm pretty sure that issuing a summons to some guy smoking dope in the park is exactly what a cop is supposed to do.
you want to tell that to the units that are forced to cover our sector while we're single-handedly taking down drug cartels half a roach at a time?
so, what, next time I just pretend like I didn't see it?
no, next time, you stop and you think and you use your training and discretion to determine what's the best use of your time and that of your supervising officer.
this uniform you're wearing makes you accountable for your actions, and mine makes me responsible for 15 officers, and when they mess the bed, that's my problem.
because of your decision, we're sitting here paper-jockeying vouchers instead of being out there on our shift where the real criminals are.
that means overtime and that I might not see my kid and my wife tonight.
I didn't consider all that. - Next time you will.
run this over to the property clerk. I'll see you outside.
go ahead, Mac, say it.
tell me I handled that wrong and I got a lot to learn before I become a good boss.
I think you handled that like a seasoned pro, Danny, and I think you're already a good boss.
serious?
Yeah, come a hell of a long way since those first couple of years in the lab.
that was a long time ago.
I still feel like I got a lot to learn, though.
Ah, trust your instincts, don't beat yourself up if things don't always come out the way you intended.
and good luck with the drug cartels.
all right.
mac, the mystery powder from the Ferrari-- 's magic-- not literally but medically.
it's an extracellular matrix composed of fibrous proteins, namely collagen.
the glue that holds the body together.
this stuff is specifically engineered to promote rapid tissue regrowth.
I've read the research on similar compounds.
the applications are endless-- surgical wounds, severe burns, ulcers.
someday it may even grow body parts.
where did this sample come from?
there are dozens of labs working on regenerative technology.
I should be able to narrow it down. It'll just take some time.
stay on it.
I can't breathe!
oxygen... - Is it working?
gentlemen, should I be concerned?
perfect timing, Mac.
we looked into possible causes for the bruising on Michelle Moore's body, and I think we found the culprit.
krav Maga.
translated as "battle combat.
it originated in Hungary as an extremely efficient defensive fighting technique.
I'm familiar with it. It's standard training for many soldiers around the world.
then you know it's all about neutralizing your opponent as quickly as possible.
targeting the most vulnerable points.
but in this case, the bruising was on the victim's thigh and abdomen.
Yes, perfectly logical targets if the attacker had a specific agenda.
and advanced knowledge of Krav Maga pressure points.
gall bladder 31.
a kick here will render the leg useless.
conception vessel 15.
a blow here will make the diaphragm spasm, causing difficulty breathing and severe pain.
she was deliberately paralyzed and made to suffer.
our perp is the total package-- cold, calculating, sadistic.
he's gone. You can get up now.
what exactly are we looking for?
the smoking gun.
these are myocardiocyteal cells from Michelle's heart.
take a look.
the contours of the nuclei are stretched and narrowed.
precisely what happens when cells are introduced to electricity.
our C. O.D. was electrocution.
the charge was delivered through her leather jacket. That's why there were no burns on the skin.
what are you thinking for a murder weapon?
something efficient, easy to conceal. Like a stun gun.
they don't produce nearly the 0. 1 amps needed to stop the heart.
but if modified, a stun gun could deliver its full charge in one fatal burst.
at the risk of sounding a bit envious, I do have to ask, how did you figure out electric shock?
I think I know who killed her.
our suspect is Dominik Janos.
why does that name sound so familiar?
cause FBI and Interpol have been chasing him since the early '90s. He's become a ghost.
with Janos, fact and fiction are easily blurred.
what's he wanted for?
everything from drug and weapons charges to human trafficking.
so why are we liking him for a murdered car thief?
Janos was arrested at 14 for brutally attacking a cop after being arrested for shoplifting.
he spent five ars in a prison outside Budapest where he learned Krav Maga.
after his release, three of the cop's family members were found murdered, all of them had their tracheas crushed by a single strike to the throat.
this guy's insane.
Janos vanished for a few years, later turned up in Colombia as a Medellin enforcer providing us with the only other known photo of him.
his specialty was electric shock because of the efficiency and extreme pain it causes.
it also gave him the knowledge and know-how to easily turn a stun gun into a killing machine.
how is this guy still free after all these years?
there must be eyewitnesses reports, a physical description.
his complex aliases and altered appearances made them all unreliable and inconsistent.
like the accounts of his death two years ago.
the yacht he was on reportedly caught fire and sank, taking everyone down with it.
well, a dead man didn't kill Michelle.
no, but maybe a burned man did.
the regenerative powder.
he's using it to regrow scar tissue.
transferred it to the controls in the Ferrari.
then why take the time to turn on the radio and air conditioner?
nothing is random with Janos.
whatever it was, he had a good reason for getting into that car.
Michelle might have known what it was and that's why he killed her.
and Nicole might know, too.
even if Janos just thinks she does, Nicole is in serious danger.
and so is her family.
police.
Mr. Noonan?! Audrey?!
Arthur, it's Detective Flack.
it's too late. Janos was already here.
neighbors didn't hear anything.
paratransit company says they drove Audrey and her father directly home from the precinct.
Janos could have already been here waiting.
any sign of the girl? - Not yet.
victim's been dead no more than six hours.
no physical trauma except for two small contact burns on his chest.
same stun gun?
this time applied directly to the skin, not through a leather jacket.
I also found paint chips on the carpet from this window right here.
window frame's painted shut.
somebody tried to get it open, but couldn't.
Audrey tried to run.
and hide. Found this underneath the bed.
she was dialing 911.
Yeah. Perp must have caught her before she could hit send.
these are her fingernail marks on the carpet.
twisted freak dragged her out by her ankles.
if we haven't found a body, maybe Audrey's still alive.
Janos would have killed her right away, if that was his intention.
he took her for a reason. - Some kind of ransom?
or leverage against the only family member left-- Nicole.
Hey, Cooper... - Sarge.
listen, about before... - No, I,I deserved what I got.
I was a bit out of line.
shaving my head would've been out of line, but what happened earlier, that was just you teaching me how to be better.
as long as I didn't push you too hard.
you don't have to worry about me. I'm much tougher than I look.
truth is, you're gonna be a great cop.
and that's more than anyone ever said about me when I was starting out.
did you make as many mistakes as me?
twice as many.
I was impulsive, I was arrogant, I thought I knew everything.
eh, you know, some things never change.
all right, now take it easy, rookie-- but I want you to keep doing what you're doing, okay?
mistakes and all. 'Cause that's the only way you ever really learn.
as long as you promise not to pull any punches the next time I do drop the ball.
that's easy enough. Deal.
Hey, Sarge... - Yeah.
me and some of the guys are gonna go get couple beers, and there's always room at the table for one more screw-up.
I gotta head home.
maybe next time.
Nicole Moore is back on the radar.
two more Ferraris reported stolen over the last four hours.
two family members dead and one missing, and it's business as usual?
not exactly.
both cars were taken by force in plain sight of eyewitnesses and surveillance cameras.
her M. O. has completely changed.
why is she so desperate to steal these particular cars?
Hey, I just got off Skype with a biotech firm in Denver.
they've been working on a wound powder -
it's designed specifically to regrow skin that's been damaged by burns, but it's not for sale yet.
there are a hundred different ways Janos could have gotten some.
I'm not sure if this helps, but there's a pretty significant list of side effects.
what kind of side effects?
where do I start? Shooting pain, bacterial infection, light sensitivity.
light sensitivity.
I never should have bought such an expensive car.
I just let vanity get the best of me.
sometimes ego clouds our perspective.
especially when birthdays start flying by.
we had him.
Nathan Purdue is Dominik Janos.
and now he knows we're onto him.
I spoke to the Bureau. They've been investigating Purdue for months.
it turns out his textile import/export business is a cover for a money-laundering operation based in the Caymans.
why the hell didn't they share that information with us?
they didn't make the Janos connection till we made it for them.
what about Purdue's background check?
it came out clean, because on the surface it was.
he had ties to the community, supports local charities.
he's been in New York less than two years.
coincides with the sinking of his yacht.
so everyone thinks Janos is dead, and he reinvents himself as a successful businessman.
allows him to hide in plain sight while he's convalescing from any injuries he might have sustained in the fire.
Michelle and Nicole's biggest mistake wasn't stealing a car, it was stealing the wrong car.
crossing Janos put a target on their backs.
Janos could buy a hundred sports cars if he wanted to.
why would he risk exposing his true identity by going after this one?
what if it's not the car he wants, but what's hidden inside?
whatever it is, it must be worth it.
we gotta find it before he does.
to do that, we got to find Nicole first.
easier said than done.
one of the cars that Nicole jacked earlier today was fitted with a vehicle recovery system.
15 minutes after the car was stolen from here,
ACD activated the transreceiver and the black-and-white picked up the signal here.
they spotted her, tried to pull her over.
tried?
she ditched them in traffic before the chopper got there.
anher picked up the signal in Brooklyn, but they lost it before they could locate the car.
I mean, she could be anywhere right now.
where in Brooklyn?
right here.
fourth and Union.
that's three blocks from the coffee shop where Audrey met her sisters.
they must have a garage nearby.
this is Mac Taylor.
I want every available air and ground unit equipped with a vehicle recovery receiver routed to Brooklyn right away.
if that car is still in the area, we're gonna find it.
all clear, Detective.
nobody's here.
there's an apartment upstairs.
must have been where Nicole and Michelle were living.
VINs match.
this is Purdue's real stolen Ferrari.
at least some of it.
what if they dismantled the car before they knew who the owner was?
then they find out Purdue is Janos and that he wants it back?
then it's too late. Car's already been chopped.
it's a list of auto parts.
most of them are crossed off.
she could be rebuilding his car using original components.
as a trade for Audrey.
exactly.
the second Janos gets that thing back, he'll kill them both.
there are still a few pieces not crossed off on this list.
the parts she's still after?
it's difficult to fence parts from such high-end exotics.
the girls must have had a network of black market dealers that were working for them.
it would have been a fight for her to get back the parts that are still on those dealers' shelves.
damn near impossible to retrieve the parts that have already been sold.
she'd have to steal them back.
if we can find out who bought those parts and what cars they've been installed on, we've narrowed down her next target.
we just have to beat her to it.
police! Do not move! - NYPD! Don't move!
it's over, Nicole!
you just killed my sister.
you're wasting time. Audrey needs help now.
Nicole, we're gonna help your sister, you have my word.
you need to calm down and answer my questions.
sit down. Take a seat!
when did you learn that you'd stolen from Dominik Janos?
the morning after.
we'd already chopped his car and distributed the parts to shops around town.
and Michelle wanted to run, lay low for awhile...
but I'd heard the ghost stories.
there's no hiding from that monster, and it was too late to give him back his 458, so we decided to give him one that looked just like it.
our plan was for Michelle to show him the car, while I stayed hidden.
something went wrong; I was supposed to go for help.
I froze...
praying he would just drive away.
but, somehow, he knew we had tried to trick him.
where is my car?
she couldn't tell him because she didn't know.
it happened so fast.
there was nothing I could do.
I walked away.
and I waited... a few minutes.
then I ran.
and I should... I should've done more, but...
I should've tried to help her.
if you had, you'd be dead now, too.
I knew it was just a matter of time before he came after me, so I went straight back to the garage, and I waited, and when my cell rang, I knew it was him calling.
only Michelle had my number.
he had her phone.
by then, he'd already killed your father and kidnapped Audrey.
he said I had 24 hours to return his car-- his whole car-- with every original part, or he'd kill her.
where are you supposed to bring it?
he said he was gonna call back with instructions, but now...
please...I chose this life, and I'm prepared to answer for that, but Audrey never asked to be a part of this family business, and now, because of me, she could lose her life.
and, so, please...let me try and save her.
let me bring that car back to Janos.
that's exactly what we're gonna do.
west Side Highway to Tenth Avenue.
there's an empty lot under the bridge.
do as he says. We'll be close behind.
stop, but leave the engine running.
get out and take 15 steps.
keep your back to the car at all times.
your sister will be nearby.
do as you're told. Once I drive away, you'll both be free to go.
bitch!
what's the matter, Janos?
look like you've seen a ghost.
you okay? - Never better.
get down on the ground!
what about Audrey? - Still looking.
Hey, Mac! Jo!
over here!
tires feel warm.
Janos transferred powder to three buttons-- the radio...
the thermostat, and the hazard lights.
he installed a hidden trap.
Ah, forged passports, credit cards, birth certificate-- everything Janos needs to get out of the country.
FBI and Interpol would have to start over at square one.
he found out the Feds were onto the Purdue alias, and knew his window for escape was closing He needed a final disappearing act.
well, that's why he had everything in the car, in case they searched his office and apartment.
must've been days away from running.
after the car was stolen, he didn't have time to get new documents.
that's why he was desperate to get 'em back.
the uncatchable Dominik Janos brought down by a family of car thieves.
I always tell my kids the only reason evil exists in the world is so that good can triumph over it.
well, if it didn't, we'd be out of a job.
Sarge!
glad you could make it out.
what the hell do you rookies think you're doing?
want to move over a little bit, or I'm gonna let you stand?
I'm just kidding. I'm joking.
it's good to see you, Sarge.
there is nothing like New York City ADL basketball.
welcome to the Mecca.
tonight's main attraction-- the top high school point guard in the city-- Riley Frazier.
what time is it?
game time!
come on, let's go.
let's go. Come on.
ladies and gentlemen, we are two minutes away from game time.
lights out!
doors!
we're in the fourth quarter with 45 seconds to go.
coach Gavin's Dots trail by one.
the Higher Risers have been dominating the second half of this game.
Jamal White slams one home.
high Risers lead to three.
looks like Riley Frazier's first appearance here at the Mecca will end in defeat, unless he makes something happen.
hemmingway passes the ball to Frazier.
Frazier makes a move.
Oh, this game is not over yet!
Riley Frazier shoots a two-pointer, cutting the deficit to one.
but there's little time left on the clock.
jones brings the ball in.
Pow! Frazier steals the ball!
12 seconds left in the game.
come on. Just like we practiced, now.
dribble between your legs.
and behind your back.
second defender will rotate. No time to pass. Pump, fake and shoot.
Riley takes the shot...
it's a shot from heaven! It's good.
Frazier makes the game-winning shot.
Frazier, with 29 points, is definitely the MVP of tonight's game.
this is another victory for Coach Gavin Lewenten, the winningest coach in ADL history.
the game tonight was brought to you by our corporate sponsor.
there he is.
heard your game on the radio yesterday, little brother.
you know, if it were me, I would have just jumped over everybody and dunked it. Know what I'm saying?
Oh, yeah. Then your new ten-inch vertical would have woken up.
that game was for you-- a welcome home present.
Ah, thanks. Uh... consider this my gift.
I'm clean.
no more drugs, and this time, I'm staying out.
and only two things kept me sane in that cell.
listening to your games on the radio, and the, uh, thought of seeing this pretty face again.
our vic is Angela Kelly, stabbed several times.
landlord called it in when she didn't answer the door.
she have a roommate?
boyfriend moved in three weeks ago after he was released from prison.
according to these letters I found in her bedroom...
his name was Hank Frazier.
looks like Angela left us a message.
eight seconds on the clock.
he shoots. He scores!
Hank Frazier has done it again!
heavenly Father, we thank You.
from Your hand comes every good thing.
we thank You for every earthly blessing, strength and health.
the eyes of all wait upon You, O God.
and it is You who fills all living things with the breath of life.
thank You for family and fellowship.
we thank You for food and nourishment.
bless Your name.
by this meal, feed us for Your holy service, that we may be diligent in the responsibilities You've given us.
Amen.
police. Hank Frazier, you're coming with us.
stand up, put your hands behind your head.
what are you doing to my brother?
Hey, heyey, stand back.
you're under arrest for the murder of Angela Kelly.
whoa. Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. H-Hold on.
this is crazy. Riley!
you know, some guys wait till after family dinner before they go out and stab their girlfriends to death.
I'm just saying.
it's okay. You-You really expect me to believe what you're saying?
who do you suppose Hank is?
she wrote your name on the door in her own blood.
no. No, no, no, no. I... I didn't do this.
I love Angie.
Hey, you don't know anything about me, man.
right. What I do know-- there was no forced entry at the crime scene.
that means she either knew her killer, or her killer had a key.
or in your case, both.
cocaine found in the bedroom.
preliminary tox screen says you got coke in your system.
you got out of prison three weeks ago after doing a stint for possession.
how many times did you promise her you were gonna change?
open your hand. - Ange, come on.
you've only been out of jail for three weeks, and you couldn't stay clean. For me.
I tried. You got to believe me.
brought that into my home.
I'm done. I am so done.
I want you out. I want you out now!
no, I ain't going anywhere.
put my stuff down. - No!
put it down.
what kind of game you playing then, huh? - Isn't a game.
Yeah, well, I couldn't have done that because I wasn't there.
I was in a dope house getting high.
that's your alibi-- you were in a crack house getting high? - Yeah.
your Honor, I'd like to call my next witnesses-- Two Tooth Willy and Crackhead Pooky.
you think that's gonna fly in front of a judge and a jury?
most likely, since your coke got tossed around the room, you were out trying to get more.
look, fine. Yeah, I'll tell you everything.
I'll-I'll give you the whole thing.
but first, I... I need to talk to my brother.
they say death by 1, 000 paper cuts is torture.
death by ten stab wounds isn't much better.
Oh, fits the theory. Crime of passion.
any drugs in her system?
tox results say no.
judging by the shape of the wounds, the murder weapon was most likely a knife.
most wounds are on her right side.
on the palm, the forearm. Defensive wounds.
all, except one. At the top of her spine.
Yeah, probably inflicted when she was trying to run away.
indeed, but her will to fight may help us.
I found epithelials under her nails.
in addition to that, I also found... something else.
it appears to be laminated plastic with a reflective surface.
I'll have Adam take a closer look.
finally, I found this interesting.
while three of the victim's wounds show hilt marks, the other seven do not.
well, maybe they were delivered with less force.
maybe the killer got fatigued.
a sobering thought, to say the least.
however, using dissection, I discovered that the deepest wound tracts belong to the wounds without hilt marks.
well, how could that be if they were delivered with less force?
Hey, Mac, Hank's younger brother, Riley, just showed up.
no, he came alone. He says his mother wrote Hank off years ago.
seems like Riley might be all he has left. We should definitely get something out of this.
all right.
there he is... little brother.
Riley, you know I'm innocent. No matter what, you can't...
No!
or maybe not.
what are you doing, Riley?! I didn't kill Angie.
step back!
you know I loved her. Hey, you know me!
I'm still your brother!
consider this an agreement between brothers,
that I, Riley Frazier,"promise to not allow anyone or anything to distract me from my goal of playing professional basketball.
signed by you with your brother as witness.
we made that contract when I was seven.
makes me sick to hear it now.
was he on drugs?
we found coke in his system.
he promised he was clean this time.
you really think he killed Angie?
looks that way.
my brother, I grew up wanting to be him.
okay, that guy in there, was one of the best high school basketball players to come out of Brooklyn.
so, what happened?
he tore his Achilles.
that meant rehab, drugs.
but no college wanted to recruit him.
he got depressed. Was never the same.
soon enough, it was less rehab, more drugs.
God bless Angie.
she stayed with him through thick and thin.
addiction's a pain in the ass.
can make someone a threat to anyone or anything in his way.
so, how is your sister?
that obvious?
I used to live in fear of this.
getting a call after she did something stupid, while she was all boozed up.
there was a time not too long ago she very easily could've wound up in that chair.
you speak with her regularly?
depends on how you define regularly.
Hey, Sid.
I believe our killer gave us the finger.
when I opened the victim's body, I discovered that the stab wound at the top of her spine partially transected the left side of her spinal cord between the 3rd and 4th cervical vertebrae.
that would cause paralysis on the left side.
which explains why most of the defensive wounds were on the right side of her body.
but she had blood on her left index finger.
a finger she was incapable of using.
so Angela Kelly did not write Hank's name on that door.
someone else did.
you said you had something for me?
Yes. A second piece of evidence that was staged at our crime scene.
we know that when a stab wound is delivered with force it will leave a hilt mark bruise on the skin, right?
however, according to Sid, it was the stab wounds without hilt marks that left the deepest wound impressions on our vic's body.
so the question remains, how does a stab delivered with less force leave a deeper wound tract?
right.
so I bought the same brand of knives we found at Angela Kelly's kitchen and used the knife that was missing from her set.
the hilt marks match.
the missing knife from Angela's kitchen is our murder weapon.
Yeah.
doesn't explain the difference in the wound depth.
what I discovered is that when the knife is pressed into soft tissue, instead of being stabbed with force and retracted, it may not leave a bruise on the skin, but it does push the soft tissue out of the way.
so, ng into tissue creates a deeper wound tract.
that means the seven wounds without hilt marks on our victim were pressed, not stabbed with force.
exactly. Someone stabbed our vic three times, and then pressed another seven wounds into her body.
to increase the number of wounds and make it seem like a crime of passion.
someone took their time with this, precisely thinking it through.
Hank Frazier's name on the door.
angela Kelly's stab wounds.
both staged at our crime scene.
we have to reevaluate everything.
I haven't finished analyzing all the spatter, but I did find one stain particularly interesting.
satellite spatter; it's blood in blood.
I analyzed it for DNA, and I got two profiles.
one was a match to our victim, but the other one wasn't a match to our victim or Hank.
a foreign donor at the scene. Most likely our killer.
we need to figure out who that second blood drop belongs to.
Danny, help Lindsay with the blood analysis. - You got it.
Hawkes says the epithelials under our vic's nails were a low-level sample, so he's reamplifying and running it again.
in addition to that, maybe there's a connection on paper.
I've been working on that torn document from Angela's apartment.
could be another piece of staged evidence, but it might get us some prints.
whoever did this probably knew Angela's schedule and knew that she was living with Hank.
could have had something to do with his drug problem, too, right?
they kill her to get back at him.
whatever the motive, Hank may still be connected to this.
NYPD, open up.
just a second.
you've been knocking on my door like that since what, the Academy?
you're not careful, you're gonna scare my boyfriends away.
exactly what a brother should do.
you cut your hair.
you did. It looks nice.
thank you.
I could tell you that I just happened to be in the neighborhood, but honestly, since four of my last five calls to your phone went straight to voicemail and the fifth one told me your number was changed,
I don't feel like justifying myself.
yeah? Well, what's the real reason for this visit?
let me take a guess-- you caught a homicide.
maybe a sibling thing.
I don't know, an addict? Alcohol?
you got to thinking,"You know who I haven't spoken to in a stretch?
I'm fine, Don.
I mean, I'm little bit hungover from that rave party I threw last night, but, other than that...
you know, part of my 12 steps was getting you to smile.
I just need to know that you're okay.
I'm fine.
and I'll get you my new number.
I've been sober as a church mouse, Don.
that's why all I do all day is stay inside watching The Young and the Restless.
that's the worst part about working the day tour-- missing my stories.
Thanks.
what have you got for me, Adam?
I took a closer look at the fragment that Sid pulled from our vic.
it turns out the reflective surface is a photopolymer film.
stuck it under the microscope, and I noticed the edge of a 3-D image.
a hologram. Pretty cool.
Yeah. Check this out, though.
even fragments of holograms have the entire image.
just needed to project it. Thus, the laser show.
which you appear to be very proud of. - I am.
I did a photo image search on that particular hologram, and it turns out to be a business logo.
Asantewaa Living.
it's a holistic company in California.
they sell energy supplements, vitamins, promote a healthy lifestyle.
their logo was found on trace from our victim's body.
not so healthy.
Hey, Mac, I finished re-amplifying the epithelials from our vic's nails.
got a hit in CODIS.
Nick Blount. Priors for assault, and more recently, he graduated to being a street pharmacist.
meth, coke, heroin.
Yeah, and that's not all.
his place of employment-- same place our vic Angela Kelly worked-- a barber shop in Brooklyn called Groove Cutz.
I'm taking my talent to South Beach, bitch!
what up?!
Really? When you leaving?
I...I...I'm... I'm actually not-not going anywhere.
unless I keep doing stupid stuff like this.
um, but listen, it's all for a really good purpose, I swear.
I'm all ears.
okay, um, I contacted the holistic company in California.
turns out, they just teamed up with an athletic apparel company, Wyandotte Sports.
they're making bracelets for athletes, okay?
and these holograms are supposed to give you stamina and keep up your energy during the game.
they're super exclusive and super expensive.
and super ridiculous.
if they're so exclusive, is there an I. D. factor on these bracelets?
you mean, like a serial number that might link us to the owner?
Yeah.
I see how it is.
you come in he, and you don't talk to the barbers and whatnot, but you wa to pick on e exon that's sweeping up everybody's hair.
makes it a little easier when the ex-con leaves evidence at a murder scene.
how about you spare us the pity party and answer the question?
why, whayou got?
ithelials under he nailor sething.
five of my cell mategot put aw off that stuff.
as for me, I got a perfect explanation.
you see, Angela-- she was the best stylist in this place.
a real artist. So, she hooked me up with a cut.
and after she got done cutting my hair, she massaged my scalp.
you think I'm playing? Ask anybody in here.
Hey, it's Lindsay. Go ahead.
Anna, what you got for me?
okay, so you got a scalp massage. That doesn't exactly clear you, Mr. Blount.
how well do you know Hank Frazier?
you guys like BFFs?
Freeze!
back away! - Drop that razor now!
back away, or I'll slice her open!
think I'm playing?
no, but right now, I'm aiming at your head.
and I can put a pretty nice hole in your brain before you have time to even think about hurting her.
you think I'm playing?
that's what happens when you bring a knife to a gunfight.
Yeah. Great. Thanks.
patrol found a bloody kitchen knife in a Dumpster outside Blount's apartment.
chances are, that's our murder weapon.
so that just leaves two unanswered questions.
why did Nick kill Angela, and why did he want to make it look like Hank Frazier did it?
just came from the hospital, Mac. Nick Blount suffered a severe concussion.
he's got a knot on his head the size of New Jersey; they had to induce a coma.
but he'll live, so he'll face his day in court.
Yes, and it won't be a good one.
found his prints on the murder weapon.
went to his apartment, found this cell phone, and also a kit used for making key molds.
probably used it to make a copy of Angela's key, and that's why there were no signs of forced entry at the crime scene.
that leaves Hank Frazier off the hook for now.
I've gone over everything that pertains to Nick Blount.
there's no indication that he had motive to kill Angela Kelly, or a beef with Hank Frazier.
well, I might be able to help with that.
the blood I found in the satellite spatter at the crime scene-- it's not a match to Nick Blount.
there was another person with him.
Ooh, this the torn up paper from our vic's apartment?
Yeah. I was so hoping it would give us a print, trace, anything that would lead us to our mystery third person, but no.
all of these are love letters-- there was definitely some strong feelings between them.
my first assumption was that the torn-up letter was a casualty of Hank and Angela's fight.
but now that you know that some evidence was staged, you have a different outlook.
well, I just couldn't figure out why someone would choose this particular letter to tear to shreds.
listen to it: "My Dearest Angie,"I couldn't fall asleep last night just thinking about you.
you've been better to me than I deserve. "With my mother being herself, "and Riley heading off to attend Kansas, "it's like everybody's moving on without me.
I've never uerstood why you don't do the same. Hank.
well, one thing that sticks out is that Riley made a verbal commitment to Redtown State, and this letter says that he was heading off to attend Kansas.
well, maybe Riley lied to his brother about his college decision.
something else I noticed was this is the only letter where Hank's mother and Riley are mentioned together.
well... whoever tore this up may have been trying to send a message of their own.
what, no NYPD announcement? I barely recognized the knock.
listen, I don't have a lot of time. I gotta get back to work.
but I want to talk about what's going on with you.
excuse me?
I followed you earlier. A temp agency?
why didn't you just tell me you were looking for a job?
don, you have got to stop following me, okay?
I am out of AA. I am sober. I am a grown woman.
Really? You're giving me attitude after you lied on your application?
What'd you do, walk in there and flash a badge and they just hand it to you?
what was I supposed to say?
you're supposed to tell the truth, Sam.
lying about your prior arrests and your substance abuse problem is not the way to turn your life around.
okay, I have tried doing it the right way.
you want to know what happens when you try doing it the right way?
you get a bunch of "I am sorry, miss"es...
I get it. I know it's hard.
I just... I feel like you have a second lease on life.
you have a chance to do whatever you want.
says who? You and Dad?
you always knew what you were gonna do. You Flack men-- you have NYPD in your blood.
but me? I was always the one
don't give me the "I was always a screw-up" crap, okay?
not too long ago, you had ideas.
what about your writing?
I thought you wanted to be a journalist.
I understand where you're coming from with this, but I made mistakes, Don.
I don't have the option of going that route anymore.
those days are over. Nobody wants to hire a girl with priors.
I don't want to see you give up on your dreams.
look, no offense, but can this rah-rah pep talk!
you want to be honest...
half the reason why you're here is because you care about me, and I do appreciate that.
but the other half is you feeling guilty for not coming around more often.
just save yourself the trouble.
let yourself out.
I found it odd that a low-paid ex-con like Nick Blount owned an expensive, exclusive sports wristband.
so I took a little closer look at the company-- Wyandotte Sports...
says here they have a merchandising deal with Riley Frazier's ADL team?
and the exact model bracelet that Nick Blount was wearing was made exclusively for Riley's team, and only 20 people own them.
so how did Nick Blount get his hands on one?
typically, the way that these merchandise deals work is that a company donates some apparel to the person that's in charge of the team.
so, in this case, that would be the coach.
Yep.
coach Gavin, the legend. - It gets more interesting.
Riley Frazier committed to attending Redtown State College, right?
according to the letter that his brother sent to Angela, he previously committed to going to Kansas.
kids change their college decisions all the time.
the timing of this is a little too suspicious.
I did some homework. According to on-line sports sites,
Riley has always stated publicly that his heart was set on Kansas, 'cause that was the favored choice of his brother.
now he suddenly changes his mind, after his brother's arrested.
sounds like a tug of war over Riley's future, between Hank and Coach Gavin.
and ADL coaches are often used as go-betweens.
colleges and pro agents will often pay coaches like Gavin to deliver top players.
Gavin stands to make millions by hip-pocketing a superstar like Riley.
that's all the motive in the world for Gavin to want Hank's influence out of the way.
took a closer look at the phone we found at Nick Blount's apartment.
he made a call from that cell the night of the murder.
I'll give you a hint who he called-- it wasn't Phil Jackson.
coach Gavin was the third person in Angela's apartment.
but Hank had to know Gavin had motive to do this.
why wouldn't he say anything?
there's only one reason that makes sense-- 'cause he plans to do something about it.
all right, boys!
good job! Good job!
bring it in! Bring it in!
good job. - Thanks, Coach.
coach. - Looking good.
not too bad, huh?
we gotta get Riley if you want to...
coach Gavin? - What?
raise your hands up on your head.
you're under arrest for the murder of Angela Kelly.
let it go, Hank.
you want to be a part of your brother's life?
stay out of jail and be smart and let us handle this.
hands behind your back.
all right, let's go.
five city championships, 24 All-Americans, seven NBA All-Stars...
three felonies.
you know, whatever you're accusing me of, I can assure you...
Oh, this goes well beyond accusation.
we matched your DNA to a blood drop at our crime scene.
all due respect, Detective, I think you're full of crap.
no cuts on your hands, no abrasions.
I'm guessing it was a bloody nose.
you hired Nick because he worked with Angela.
he had access to her apartment keys and could make copies.
still think I'm full of crap?
how much did you pay Nick?
did you pay him with cash or with sports merchandise?
whatever the price, it won't be enough to save you.
as soon as Nick is conscious and able, he'll tell us everything we need to know.
look, I simply paid him to plant drugs in Hank's gym bag.
the plan was to make a call, violate his parole.
that's it.
Nick... What are you doing here?
she wasn't supposed to be home.
he wasn't supposed to kill her.
but you received a phone call from him.
I had no idea what had happened until I saw for myself.
you dumb-ass! Why did you do this?
me? You're the lookout, okay?
how was I supposed to know she was just going to walk in?
yo, if you don't get off me...
Nick is a murderer, but you're the one who made things go from bad to worse.
you decided to fix things, by finishing what you went there to do.
we are screwed, both of us, unless you help with this.
so you staged that scene to pin it all on Hank.
I just wanted Hank out of the way.
he screwed up his own life. I didn't want him screwing up Riley's, too.
no, that's not it.
come on, it wasn't Riley's life you care about, it's his earning potential.
people like you are gatekeepers.
college decisions are important for players, but big business for coaches who can get players to sign with certain schools.
how much is Redtown State paying you?
how much do you stand to make after Riley leaves college if you can steer him to the right professional agent?
the right endorsement opportunities?
kids like Riley-- they're not just basketball players, they're future millionaires.
meal tickets for leeches like you.
I spent my life coaching kids.
teaching them the game.
you know how many fall by the wayside?
you know how many pan out, become stars?
do you know how many move one and forget about me?
finding Riley was, for once, like winning the lottery.
except in this case, you lose.
detective Taylor.
never got a chance to thank you for everything you've done.
no need. But can I offer some advice? - Okay.
Hank's trying. You gotta know that.
you can see it in his face that he hates disappointing you.
just imagine if basketball was taken away from you.
with Angela's death, he could easily turn back to bad influences right now.
don't give up on him.
just so you know, I... I start rehab tomorrow.
detective Taylor said that he's going to be checking in on me.
there's something about that guy makes me think he's serious.
okay. Well, go ahead, keep up the silent treatment.
you're just afraid that if we play, you'll get embarrassed.
people always said I was the better brother.
better-looking, better at basketball, better-looking...
now, if I remember correctly, last time we played, I won.
the last time we played? What's the overall record?
I got like, what, 953 wins to...
I'm sorry, how many do you have again?
check ball.
I got you something.
I don't take things from strangers.
please take it.
look, I appreciate the gift... - It's not a gift. It's a job.
you got me a job with the NYPD?
well, slow down.
I don't want you in my precinct any more than you want me in your hair.
it's with the Executive Office of Media Relations for the NYPD.
they need people with journalism backgrounds.
they had an opening, I called in a favor.
why are you doing this for me?
this is what siblings do.
they look out-- good times and bad.
look, I... I don't know, I mean, what if I screw up?
won't that reflect bad on you?
just take the job.
sometimes nepotism is a good thing.
it's not a handout.
just an opportunity for you to get back on track with some of those dreams of yours.
become the next Lesley Stahl like you always talked about.
that would make you Andy Rooney.
I'll take it.
your brother's not above doing interviews.
Yeah.
got a minute? - Yep.
did you see that?
they're gonna kill someone.
fine. Just don't let it be us.
I'd like to get home in one piece.
now, you know I've always been one to let you do your thing, but the Chief of the Traffic Bureau has asked me to pass along a message.
uh, let me guess. Hurry up? - It is the FDR, Stella.
ripple effect from shutting this down's gonna jam up the morning commute.
got my guys on the bridge, Mac.
kia Rowe. 19. No purse, no wallet.
ID in her pocket-- she wanted us to know who she was.
suicide?
maybe she had the ID in her pocket 'cause she didn't like to carry a purse.
I'm lookinat the overpass, and I'm thinking sn dive.
fall doesn't kill her, traffic on the FDR does.
she didn't jump.
defense wounds. She fought with someone.
probably was thrown from the bridge.
good-bye, suicide.
Heo, murder.
sync: YTET-wk120 -=www. ydy. com/bbs=
" young Blood"
she fought like hell. She didn't want to die.
no, she did not. Wounds are linear. Edges clean.
consistent with a knife. - Not a fair fight.
well, she scratched something or someone.
Yeah, already scraped and sent to Trace.
also plucked a fingernail fragment off her shirt.
hers are manicured and intact.
so, what you found may be our killer's.
but fingernails don't yield testable DNA. Lab's gonna have to run mitochondrial.
they've been forewarded.
she's got the feet of a dancer.
bunion. Hammer toe. Common injuries for a dancer.
the big toe angles towards the other toes, forcing itself behind the second toe, which causes the middle joint to buckle.
U were a dancer? - More like a student
jazz, tap, ballet. I... I have some skills.
as do I. Heavy Latin influence, merengue.
Sid? What about these abrasions?
well, I've been picking these particles, uh, out of the balls of her feet all morning.
my educated guess-- glass.
but the car window spidered. It didn't shatter.
not to mention she was wearing shoes when she fell.
so, where'd these come from?
dug up some background on our vic.
kia Rowe was fresh to the city. She hadn't even been here a year.
she was originally from Memphis. I ran her Social Security number.
she rents a room on theest Side and collects unemployment.
she also plays the lottery. - All it takes is a dollar and a dream.
I'm a dreamer, too. - I see.
what's that, a playbook? - Sort of.
these are dance movements.
individual steps to a particular piece of music.
this is why you're here!
it looks like she's folded it and unfolded it at least a thousand times.
it must be pretty important to her.
she wanted to dance her way to stardom. This was her ticket.
the glass shards in her feet were coated with titanium dioxide.
Titanium?
must be strongtuff. - And heat-resistant.
she's a dancer, so, I'm thinking stage lighting. We got to find a stage.
well, that shouldn't be a problem.
just like a play in football can be specific to a team, choreography can be specific to a dance company.
back, ball, change, back, ball, change, pirouette.
attitude, shoulder roll.
impressive.
those were the easy steps.
these are not.
and very well rehearsed, and I have a pretty good idea where.
all I'm saying is, I don't understand why I have to go.
I mean, it's her boss's kid's bar mitzvah. How does that concern me?
so, two hours out of your Saturday's a deal breaker?
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, I'm not the bad guy.
looks like our friend here had a bad night.
Oh! This guy's foul. Smells worse than dead.
Yeah, likeish. - Yeah, it's great.
surrounding area's undisturbed.
no sign of struggle. What do you think? Dump job?
body on Bruckner Boulevard? The Bronx? - Definitely.
no ID. - He's got a hole in his chest.
straight through to the other side.
body temp's 80. 6.
cooling rate's one point five degrees an hour.
means he's been a corpse about 12 hours.
question is, where was he before that?
interesting shape. - Extremely.
definitely caught my eye, as did his odor with my old factory senses.
Yeah, we got some of that at the scene. He was fishy.
Blackfin Snapper.
that's what the aroma reminded me of-- snapper...lightly layered with a sweet and sour relish.
course, for a little pow to the palette, I'd add sambal oelek and garlic chili sauce.
you got that from the corpse?
inspiration can be found in anything.
in this case, it was a perforation of the Inferior Vena Cava.
caused tamponading of the wound.
he was corked by the weapon?
but that didn't kill him.
what killed him? - Getting uncorked.
any idea what went through this guy? - Uh, yes.
many.
hmm. What do you got there?
no clue, but this is the fourth one I've pulled out, and it's certainly not part of him.
then it's part of the weapon.
there's gls shards in her shoes.
and littered around the stage from the spotlights.
huh. Well, the locks are just for show, so anybody could have scooped up some of them and spiked Kia's shoes.
we need to find out who this anybody is.
means I'm searching for crumbs.
I got nothing from the dancers. What did you find in Kia's locker?
uh, we got hot packs for before rehearsal, cold packs for after rehearsal, Ibuprofen for inflammation.
I guess you got to dance through the pain.
Wow. Looks like she plays every week.
I'm more of a play when the pot's huge kind of guy.
same numbers again and again.
must be her lucky numbers.
tell me about the glass, Shayna.
look, I told you, okay: I don't know how it got there.
maybe she was walking around barefoot and she stepped on the glass.
maybe. But it's also on the door release to your locker.
a thousand ways it could have gotten there.
I just need one. - You see the girls around here?
everyone's a great dancer. And I hate them. They hate me.
we're not friends, okay? We don't want each other to succeed.
and so you made sure that Kia wouldn't by sabotaging her shoes.
you hobbled her so she wouldn't make her steps.
I was proving a point. - Yeah?
what point? - I'm the best dancer here.
kia was the new girl and he had the hots for her.
okay. Lucky for you you're hot, so I'll tolerate you butchering the moves.
and that's not fai - Neither is murder.
don't you look at me like that. I didn't kill Kia.
if anything, I'm the victim here.
Yeah, I know, I know. I've heard your sob story.
now I want to hear what the knife in you locker has to say.
I got rights, okay. You can't go through my locker.
not yet. But in 20 minutes when the warrant gets here, your world opens up.
heard sand came pouring out of our victim's shoes.
if he was killed at the beach, could explain the fishy smell of the body.
that makes sense, but this doesn't.
trace from the murder weapon pulled from the vic's through and through.
looks like skin. - Yeah.
but it's not the victim's. - No.
outer layer of the human epidermis is composed solely of flattened squamous epithelial cells.
this tissue does contain epithelials, but they're mixed in with another cell type.
in English, Doc.
this skin isn't human.
unbelievable.
the vic smelled like fish because that's what went through him. Literally.
tissue in the wound is from...Xiphias...Gladius.
stabbed by a swordfish?
I'm looking at the bill on this fish and I'm thinking it's possible.
I'm not Mr. Fisherman, and I don't know a thing about swordfish, but this is real skin tissue. It didn't come off some taxidermied fish hanging on a wall-- this guy got stabbed by the real thing.
you might not be Mr. Fisherman, but I'm beginning to think our victim was.
it's a rough way to go o, but stranger accidents have happened.
death by swordfish. Man, I love being in the field.
Shayna's lawyer's starting to act up, Mac. Where are we with the knife from the locker?
nowhere.
blade is consistent with the wounds on Kia's arms, but it tested negative for blood.
so we can't prove it's the knife that slashed her up.
that's only part of the problem. Shayna's a good suspect.
jealous dancer, explains the sabotage, but it's a huge jump to go from spiking Kia's shoes to throwing her off a bridge.
especially without leaving a trace of evidence behind.
search of the bridge and overpass turned up squat.
let's back up a bit. What, besides jealousy, would be a good motive?
money.
okay, she had 30 losing tickets in her locker and this one in her pocket.
check out the numbers.
16, 23, 28, 39 and 50.
ticket was a winner.
Yeah, and her lucky numbers add up to $17 million.
and 17 million motives.
Hey, Dorothy, we gonna process or what? Commuters are piling up.
first off, Officer Murphy, I'm from Montana, not Kansas. Second...
this is my crime scene, and I'm extremely thorough.
tram opens when I'm done.
now... who is he?
Harold Claven, 64, three days from retirement. He was the tram driver.
you're bagging his hands?
can't fool you.
it was probably just a heart attack.
noted.
who found him?
commuter this morning. First tram, 6:00 a. m.
did you know this is the nation's only functioning commuter tram?
no.
and that knowledge doesn't affect me one way or the other.
Really?
I found it kind of interesting.
blood.
settle in, Murphy, I'm gonna be here awhile.
that's her.
I'll talk to her.
I knew something bad had happened.
Fred works through the night, but he comes home every morning for breakfast, take Jake to school-- always.
so when he didn't, that's when you reported him missing.
was there anyone here that had a problem with Fred, that might have wanted tourt him like this?
there's hundreds of vendors around here, I mean, some big, some small like us.
you know, and we're all selling the same thing: fish.
but sometimes costs area all going in one direction, and Fred...
I don't know, he...
he didn't want to raise the rates.
means your business is suddenly standing out from the crowd.
seems Fred Bayliss was upsetting the status quo here at the Fulton Fish Market.
so everyone under this roof is a potential suspect.
some 400, 000 square feet, I just found out.
that's a lot of people.
we got to narrow down that list. - Already on it.
area's been hosed down, but they missed a spot.
misting pattern.
blood's human.
Fred Bayliss didn't die at sea.
it weighs a ton.
actually, it's probably more like 250 pounds.
fish that size are easier for restaurants to carve up and minimize off-cuts and odd-sized portions.
what I was getting at is that I don't see somebody lifting this thing and stabbing Fred with it.
so if the fish didn't come to Fred...
Fred came to the fish.
Yeah. - And hard.
he had to be pushed.
no reaction to blood.
neither of these beaks went through Fred.
voids in the ice. We're missing fish.
murder weapon's been sold.
well, we need to find it before it becomes dinner.
I'm sorry. You want what?
those. Bingo.
actually, we only want one.
this is a customer list from the Bayliss Fish Company.
you, Richard Daly, had these swordfish delivered this morning.
this is a warrant to test the beaks for the presence of Fred Bayliss's bld.
for Fred's blood? I dot understand. What happened him?
Fred's dead. - Wait.
hold on a second.
so then, one of my swordfish...
I paid full price for them. Now they're useless, tainted.
I'm sure Fred's sorry for the inconvenience his murder has caused your restaurant.
I'm sorry. - That came out wrong.
of course, it's awful what happened to Fred...
it's just...
...well, swordfish is kind of why people come here.
pr like this can kill a restaurant.
people never cease to amaze me.
what's the word?
positive.
sorry for your loss.
my hat's off to Fred, though. I couldn't work around this smell all day long.
but a decomp dead body you're okay with?
it's a fish thing.
I'm sure if the paycheck was right, you'd be okay with it.
that figure and what Fred's pulling in are worlds apart.
so says his wife, and I'm sure you caught the uniform on his son.
in New York City, that means private school, expensive.
he wanted the best for his kid. Nothing wrong with that investment.
let's pick up the pace. I'm starting to get a little nauseous.
substances under Kia Rowe's fingernails were not from an attacker.
no foreign DNA.
found remnants of Ethylene Propylene and traces of Bisphenol A and Cresyl Glycidyl Ether.
rubber and glue...
neither of which is specific to Shayna or the Queens borough Bridge.
they may have nothing to do with Kia's murder. Sorry.
the you are. I've been looking for you everywhere.
DNA report from my case
it's a blood smear I pulled off the window sill of theoosevelt Tram.
blood came from Kia Rowe.
she didn't fall off the bridge, she fell off the tram.
two victims, one case...
tram's last run of the night was from Roosevelt Island to Manhattan-- 2: 00 a. m.
we have no other bodies.
nobody reported Harold dead until the trams opened the next morning.
so we have to assume that there were three people in the tram.
Harold the driver, Kia and our killer.
the only one to make it off alive.
safety sticker affixed with glue.
door sealant, complete with scratch marks. Kia wanted out of this tram.
and without disabling the gear box from the locking mechanism, there's no way these doors are opening while the tram is moving.
our driver knew that.
maybe he comes over, tries to help Kia.
she bolts for the window.
blood on the sill.
risked her life trying to save it.
but why?
I mean, if this is a robby over a ticket, why not just give it up?
$17 million isn't worth your life.
I'm beginning to think this wasn't about the lottery ticket at all.
the killer had to know Kia had the winning lottery ticket on her.
means they also knew the numbers. That's a lot of inside information.
but not possible.
kia played the same numbers every week.
no secret there.
then how come nobody knew she hit the big jackpot?
drawing happened long before she got on the tram, yet there's no evidence she did anything out of the ordinary - leading up to her death. - Problem is, if it's not a robbery, then we have no motive.
no, we just haven't found it yet. - Well, what's our next step?
we go over any unidentified evidence while we ask ourself one question:
if Kia lived on the West Side and the dance company was downtown...
then what was she doing on Roosevelt Island at 2: 00 in the morning, in the first place?
you know, I've never been fishing.
never even though of trying it.
seems kind of boring. - Tillou hook something.
I went fishing with my old man once out on Pier A in Battery Park.
I caught the sweetest striped bass. Must have weighed close to 30 pounds.
you eat it? - Threw it back.
would you eat anything that came out of the Hudson?
good point.
there's a fiber in the gill.
fish comes from the ocean to the freezerto the dinner plate.
how does something like that get picked up along the line?
that's not the only oddity.
flesh is bone dry.
soft. Flaccid.
Yeah.
this fish is edible, but it's not fresh.
been on ice for at least a week.
we need to find out where Fred's fish came from, don't we?
Oh, yeah.
let's find the supplier.
I'm a businessman, legitimate.
Fred Bayliss is a sketchy one.
Really?
I been asking around. Seems a lot of people were unhappy with the fish he was selling. Turns out, it all came from you.
murder weapon included.
I haul them from the Atlantic, hold them, sell them at Fulton.
after that, it's Fred's problem.
come on, what happened?
did he call you out on the bad fish you were selling him?
pissed you off a little bit?
once you add a few of those to the mix, your temper started to flare.
you're damn right I lost my temper.
and I had every reason to.
your check bounced.
that how we're doing business now?
I'm strapped for cash.
I've got extra costs. - That's your problem.
till you pay me what you owe, you're not getting the fresh catch.
okay.
how much he owe you? - 14 grand.
he didn't have that because he wouldn't raise his rates on his customers.
that's his right. But I told him, "If you stiff me again, you can find a new supply line."
I yelled, but I never laid a hand on him.
you wear that sweater yesterday?
it's the sweater I wear every day.
well, I'm gonna need a piece of it.
two fibers look like a match.
Yeah, unfortunately, looks can be deceiving.
they're both wool, but the top spectrum is from the swordfish, bottom is from McShea's sweater.
not even close. - Yeah, dyes are different, leaving me with a lone, gray fiber of unknown origin...pulled from the gill of a swordfish, no less...
...Fiber that may or may not have anything to do with Fred Bayliss' murder.
yet, it's my only lead.
so why don't you give me some good news, please?
sorry.
the sand collected off Fred Bayliss, I don't know where it came from.
all I know is it didn't come from a beach in New York.
fantastic.
mystery sand, mysty fiber, no suspects.
thanks for coming with me, Vincent.
I appreciate it. - I'm your brother. Don't be silly.
the victim's family's waiting.
they'll want answers. What have you got?
respiratory failure.
haro Claven's heart stopped beating, but it wasn't natural.
moderate subarachnoid hemorrhaging to the frontal region and a significant contusion to the occipital lobe.
AKA-- coup contrecoup.
whiplash to the brain? - Exactly.
he died before any visible bruising could form.
the first blow to his head was also his last.
as the head recoils, the brain hits the back of the skull, crushing the occipital lobe, then sloshes forward from the momentum.
swelling around the brain stem leads to respiratory arrest.
oxygen flow to the heart is stopped. The result is death.
the result is murder.
Oh, one more thing. Um, some sort of gel.
I swabbed it. I have no idea what it is.
when I find out...
I'll let you know.
mitochondrial DNA from the fingernail found on Kia matchemito DNA from skin found under the tram driver's nails.
okay, same DNA on both our vics. It means it most likely came from our killer.
the DNA's male. It rules out Shayna, the other dancer, and leaves us with no suspects.
not for long. It's a bodega receipt Lindsay collected from the tram.
Buprofen, aspirin, hot pack and one lottery ticket.
that was Kia's receipt.
exactly.
kia lived on the West Side.
south Point Park is a Roovelt Island address.
who lives there?
the choreographer.
Yes, Kia was at my apartment. We were hanging out.
innocent fun.
she ended up dead. I don't call that innocent.
I don't believe this.
I got a theater full of mediocrity and now the cops are on my ass.
why don't you lose the attitude？
fine. I'll play along.
kia had a bad audition yesterday. She really blew it.
nevertheless, I decided to give her anotr shot.
she blew that opportunity as well.
how badly do y want to be a dancer?
I am a dancer!
and you're a scumbag.
she made her point, and took off. That was the last time I saw her.
I don't believe that for a second.
of course not. You're a cop.
no.
it's because people lie.
but DNA doesn't.
you offer up yours-- prove what you say is true.
definitely not.
we done here?
back to work.
let me see that again.
won't give us his DNA to prove his innocence.
we'll just use it to prove his guilt.
Fred Bayliss paid how much for his son to go to preschool?
14 thousand change, which I'm guessing is why he owed close to the same amount to McShea.
what do they got at these schools
yellow finger paint made with gold?
Nope. Just a waiting list a mile long full...
...of names of the city's most elite toddlers.
that seals it.
I'm not having kids. Much too expensive.
what happened to "There's nothing wrong with that investment"?
you two can't answer your cell phones?
much too impersonal.
we prefer the face-to-face interaction.
which is why we were on our way to see you right now.
follow me.
I now know where the sand from Fred Bayliss' clothes came from.
I also know it's not just sand.
okay, I'm seeing sand and shells.
Kahelelani shells.
extremely expensive and indigenous only the Hawaiian island Nihau.
it's a private island. - Private island.
that means Fred wasn't walking along any sandy beaches unless he was invited by someone.
I don't think Fred Bayliss went to Hawaii. I think Hawaii came to him.
he imported the sand and shells?
this is New York City. If you've got the money, anything's possible.
but he was just getting by.
he's the poster y for the working class guy.
he is...
but his son isn't. His son plays with New York's elite.
so the sandbox was a gift?
as was the computer lab, and e plasma televisions in the language center.
parents often donate gifts of such magnitude.
they want the best for their children.
you mean they want their children accepted to the school.
the bigger the gift, the better chances our child has of becoming one of the chosen few, right?
a donation, no matter the size, does not guarantee admittance.
ultimately, it's all about the child.
personality?
potential.
so Fred Bayliss' son has what it takes to go the distance?
he's a perfect fit for the school.
strong recommendation letter, great terview and parents that wanted to be involved.
so the Baylisses were the perfect family.
yet they were also into minority.
you admitted 20 new students this year out of 100 applicants.
what happens to the other kids that aren't accepted?
we're the be choice... not the only choice.
excuse me.
Yeah. Thanks for nothing.
okay...
so Fred's son is othe fast track to the Ivy League, but that still doesn't get us any closer to who killed Fred.
no, it doesn't, but what it does mean is that we've exhausted every piece of evidence...
...except our mystery fiber.
back to the lab?
all right.
our choreographer is a lech, but not a murderer.
our suspect count is bacto zero.
think is was a random event?
it's possible.
who wants to play?
hydrogen sulphide?
I borrowed that from the Trace lab.
stuff stinks. That rotten egg smell, it's absolutely awful.
Yes, I'm aware of that. Why is it in my office?
for the sake of science.
well, come on, Mac, it's for sence.
okay, go ahead.
this gel was found on Harold Claven's neck.
the tram driver.
now it's on my lip. What is it?
in a word, amazing.
one swipe under the nostrils provides the human olfactory pathway with a source of cross-adapting odorants, effectively altering the brain's smell receptors.
so it makes bad smells smell nice.
better than nice;like vanilla.
not bad. In fact, it's vanilla.
Really? - Yeah.
this little gem of a proct is called Odorscreen and it'sot yet available commercially.
then who's using it?
borough sanitation, on a trial basis.
the guys at the 82nd Street garage are the guinea pigs.
any connection to Kia Rowe?
no.
but there is a connection to Harold Claven.
the tram driver?
