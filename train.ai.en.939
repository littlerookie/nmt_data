awesome!
I'm sorry, have we met?
no, we haven't. I'm Mitch Planko.
Hi, Sabrina McKay.
Hey, Sabrina.
hold on.
you two guys should go out. What?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, man!
please stop. - You two guys need to go out.
absolutely, you two should go out.
you're so single, Mitch, right?
and you're so fucking white-hot, right? This body.
did you do a lot of swimming in college?
don't answer that. You bet she did.
Oh, my God, you guys need to go out, have a nice steak dinner, do some dancing, go to a Korean nightclub, get a belly full of pills.
I don't know what you're into, but just have some fun.
what about Ecco on 7th Street, Saturday at 8: 30?
great? Great!
he's totally free, so he's going to meet you there.
don't fuck on the roof, though.
that place has got this non-resin tar that's a bastard to wash off.
so, just oral.
Yes, you're thinking about it.
she's in.
this is good.
you're going to get me fired! I swear to God.
shut it down. For one second, you listen to me.
for the first time in your life, you're fucking good-looking, okay?
you're single, you got the right number of fucking balls in that bag, and you got the opportunity to nail number one on your cancer list.
I can't do that. I'm not doing it.
you need this! This is fucking dinner with her!
this is so good.
I mean, what's going on between us, it's just crazy, crazy.
here's what's crazier, not using it.
not using it on her.
you use it for her, you use it for you, and maybe a little bit for me, you know?
remind yourself of that. Remind yourself of the big, fucking crater you created right there on Tuesday night.
Oh, the Tuesday night, again. I could use that.
she'd fit perfectly in there. Will you please drop that?
every day with the Tuesday night! Well, it's a big goddamn deal!
you fucked me! You owe me! Respect my life!
respect mine.
Yeah, you respect your life.
fine! I am proud of you.
just promise me, you listened to every word I said.
I heard everything. Every single syllable, you got it?
did you hear everything I said?
caught a few things. Yeah, just enough.
you betcha. You go have a good time, little girl.
I got your life all put away here, nice and safe.
answer my phone.
hello.
Hi, Mitch Planko.
Bingo! Who the fuck is this?
what?
dad? Hello?
is this Mitch's dad? Is this Mitch, Sir?
Dave? Hi, this is Dave Lockwood.
why are you calling me?
I just wondered if we can get together for a little while today.
boy, it's a work day. Half an hour.
I look different. I don't like my outfit today.
Dave, half an hour.
Mitch, Sr. wants to sit down with Dave Lockwood.
Yeah. Why?
I need to talk to you about Mitch.
hello.
Dave. How are you?
good, thank you.
what are we doing here? When was the last time the two of us saw each other?
I don't care. Listen.
I'm getting married to a very beautiful woman named Pamela.
her name's Pamela? Yes.
wow, you can say "I do" in English this time.
what? Is Pamela from America?
Yes.
anyway...
I'm not going to have anybody there.
the only family I have is Mitch.
I went to his apartment a couple of days ago and told him that Pamela would like him to say a few words at the wedding and that wasn't true.
truth of the matter is, I would like him to say a few words, if he could find it in his heart to do so.
I don't know why you don't tell him yourself.
that is a very nice thing for a son to hear.
so, you want me to go tell Mitch that you would like him at the wedding.
he's going to say, "Why the hell does he want me there?" He thinks I'm an idiot.
well, that's not totally true.
I think he's got some nice qualities.
I think he's got some problem areas, too.
what are those?
you're his friend, you know him as well as I do.
you probably know him better than I do. He's a quitter!
he has never finished anything in his life.
he picks up something, he puts it down.
he's good at it for five minutes, and it's gone.
he's flaccid. No gumption. No get-up-and-go.
his accomplishments could rest comfortably on an eyelash.
Oh, he'd probably say, "Fuck you," if he heard you say that.
well, maybe he would and maybe he wouldn't.
but I want him to be part of my life.
with all due respect, Mr. Planko, you don't know Mitch.
what you don't realize about him is that he's a fucking Jedi!
a what? He's a Jedi Knight, sir.
and next time you see him, he's going to be slitting throats.
fuck!
I'm not a fucking quitter!
all right, let's do this.
good morning, Patty-cakes.
daddy needs a box set of Law & Order, three meatball subs and a hand-folded, 24-inch samurai sword, chop-chop.
what are you doing?
I got this one. I got it.
back to bed.
you are in dire financial need!
Objection!
sustained.
excuse me.
Hi.
fuck me, she's cute.
here comes the battement.
fucking nice, Cara!
sweet!
that bitch bounced. Beautiful!
man alive! That's my daughter, bitches!
dad's very proud. Keep going.
Oh, I mean, what did we learn from this?
always solve my problems with violence.
that's bingo, baby! Five, up high.
No! Yes!
no, that is not the lesson that we learned, Cara.
it is!
violence is cool.
Dave. Kidding.
I'm not kidding.
she did make a pretty funny sound, though, when she hit the ground like that. Yes, she did!
but don't make a habit out of that, okay?
I know. All right.
I love you, Daddy.
I love you, little girl.
Hey.
that ass looks real hot, you know.
you like my ass?
Yeah. Tight as a drum.
wouldn't mind putting my drumstick in it.
Ooh! Really? Ha. Keep going.
I like how big and fat those tits have gotten.
this little calf wants to get her mouth on the udders.
and I think that I want you to fuck me like you just got out of jail.
Roger that.
and you don't even have to go down on me because I know it's late.
appreciate it. All right, turn around.
Oh! What are you doing? Here we go.
what do you mean? I thought you said you wanted to have some sex.
Yeah, but not like two dudes at a rest stop, okay?
okay, I got it. Want to go grab me three Q-tips?
how about we just do what we always do?
what, do you mean with a lot of eye-contact and real personal?
Uh-huh. Come here. I love you.
Yeah. Oh, don't say that.
let's not... How about no talking, okay?
we can do some silent sex. Seriously.
kiss me. No, no, no. No talking.
all right, let me kiss a shoulder first. Okay? Okay.
there you go. Where's that hand going?
Hello! Did you shave your balls?
who doesn't love a couple of smooth criminals?
is that why there was all that pubic hair in the drain?
I would bet, yeah. Why are you still soft?
I don't know. Can we try the no-talking for just, like, three minutes?
that's all it's gonna take, okay?
let's do it like we did it on our wedding night.
no, no, no. Jamie, what are you talking about, our fucking wedding night?
God! I can't do this! Why not?
I cannot believe I can't do this!
what the hell is happening? God damn it!
what?
you don't want to have sex with me?
Yeah, I want to have sex with you.
I've wanted to have sex with you since the sixth grade!
I mean, you should be a mess by now, but things are not... Well, let's do it!
this is new.
sorry, Jamie.
I think I'm in over my head.
I think I'm way in over my head. I got this fucking house, and a job, and a family.
I've got you, I've got the Kids, and I've got a fucking carpool. And rules!
I've got these fucking rules, half of which I don't even understand.
this is impossible. I don't know how to be this man.
I'm sorry.
sorry. That's okay.
that's okay.
come here.
Yeah, it's fantastic in here.
it's very warm. I think I remember this.
Mmm-hmm.
Dave Lockwood.
Mitch! Where the hell are you?
it's been two days. I gotta know what's going on with Jamie.
call me back.
what the hell is he doing?
Mitch. Hi.
Jamie. What are you doing here?
I come here every Saturday after yoga. What are you doing here?
I am plowing the crap out of this chick around the corner, and now we're gonna have dinner. We're gonna make some scallops, and then it's going to get ugly. This chick is a mess.
why do you have to talk like that? You have such a sweet side.
you should let people into your sweet side.
Yeah. Listen, I wanted to ask you something.
the other night, you were in a pretty dark place.
Oh, yeah. I know.
how's that going with Dave?
is he treating you a little bit better?
Yeah. He's been very sweet.
really open and communicative... Good.
he held my hand all night while we slept last night.
Attaboy!
did you tell Dave to shave his balls?
uh...
don't act like you didn't tell him. I know it came from you.
don't be a bad influence on him.
I thought you two might like that.
no, I don't like that. It needs some coverage.
Yeah, I'll tell him to grow it out.
it was really great seeing you. You okay?
I'm good. In fact, I'm much... Much better now.
good. Yeah.
okay. All right.
okay, I'm awake.
fuck it.
Hello, I'm trying to find... - Oh, come on!
look, bring it to me in the office. I don't care.
relax, I'll be there. Yes, sir.
just look at... This is important. Taxi!
thank you.
thank you, America.
Whoa!
I've got my eye on you!
go for Lockwood.
Mitch, I'm panicking over here.
I haven't been on a date in 18 years.
I'm drowning in my own fear.
relax and calm down.
don't tell me to relax! You did this to me. I can't do it, okay?
don't move, I'll be right there.
Mitch?
Hey.
how do I look?
just grow a mustache and lure a child into your van.
where did you find that shit?
the back of your closet.
put it back!
these are called jeans.
they've been popular with America's youth for over 60 years.
jeans to a restaurant? Yeah, jeans to a restaurant.
look who else can hit.
in order to feel confident, you got to look good, okay?
this is a vest, put that on.
okay, this is called gel or product.
too little, you look like a pedophile, too much and you look Persian.
Mitch, I have done everything that you have asked of me.
I got the jeans on, I got the vest, the gel in my hair...
you look great. ... But I am not going to do this.
Yes, you are going to do this. Why do I have to do this?
because it shows that you're considerate, that you're clean, that you're American.
why do you even care? It's my body!
it's my body right now!
I'm scared!
there, we have it.
nobody ever needs to know that this happened, Mitch.
boy, real tempting to kiss my own dick.
Ah, that tickles.
shh, you're jiggling the sac.
Oh, you're going to go all the way back there, huh?
we're going to dinner, not Rio.
ah right. You got any extra batteries?
Hi.
Mitch. How are you?
okay.
so...
what the weather?
listen, the only reason I'm here is because my boss told me to be.
this is not a date. This is not a "get to know you."
this is just me trying to save my job.
I'm going to go.
just sit the fuck back down.
I showered, I showed up, I'm starving and I could use a drink.
how long have you known Dave?
my whole life, actually.
and have you ever seen him act like he did yesterday?
like a super-douche?
Yeah.
uh, I have, at times.
but I'm really hoping that he didn't say anything to offend you.
he totally did.
but I like being offended, just usually after work.
Wow.
here's the bottle you ordered, sir. Excellent.
mmm-mmm, send that shit back.
bring us two Macallan 25s, neat.
right away, ma'am. Right away.
so, let me ask you something.
it's a question.
how do you like working with Dave?
how is he?
I love it.
I mean, he's a brilliant lawyer.
he's the best.
actually, if you must know,
I used to kind of have a crush on Dave.
Oh, no, you didn't!
you're funny.
I mean, obviously, he's married, so...
right, obviously, obviously, obviously.
Super-married. What do you do, Mitch?
me? For a living? Yeah.
you know, I am...
I...
when I'm not eating hummus and ferociously masturbating,
I dabble in light porn.
I hear that's a growth industry. Yeah!
I'm just going to get everything on the dessert menu.
I'm going to order, like, six desserts.
Oh, my God.
no, no, no!
do I have anything in my teeth?
that's a lot of sugar.
Yeah. A lot of scotch!
Yeah. That was a lot of fun, is what it really was.
was? What, are we done?
it's only 2: 00!
No! I'm just messing with you.
no, let's...
we'll go to a rave or something. You want to get raving?
people raving right now?
let's rave! Yeah.
I forgot about raves!
man, I'm messing with you.
go and do that? No.
I do have an idea. Uh-huh.
what do you think about doing something that we will really, really regret in the morning?
you into it?
Yeah, we can definitely do that.
okay!
okay. Let's go. - All right, let's go.
fuck, fuck, fuck!
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, God!
Oh. Wow. Really?
are you sure that's what you want?
Absolutely. I like that.
you're okay with that being on your body for, like, forever?
I feel pretty good about it.
how is yours down there?
it's good.
it tickles a little.
Rico. Yo.
what do you think of this turn, man?
I don't know, man.
ask Tommy. Tommy!
Yeah, man.
check this out, man.
you never did tell me about your childhood.
Really? Now?
with the Sons of Anarchy between your...
um, let's see here...
Tommy, Rico. Hey, guys.
we are sightseeing now.
let's move it along, please. Come on.
you are such a gentleman.
now you only have one ponytailed ex-convict between your legs, so everything is fine.
I'm kidding. I was absolutely joking.
I love your ponytail. And that little pirate beard.
sun kidding.
that's me, there.
this is you. Mmm-hmm.
Yeah, that is nice. Thanks.
Yeah.
well, good night.
good night.
Hey, Mitch?
Yeah.
are you going to call me?
I thought you said this wasn't a date.
things change.
that's a cute tie. Thank you.
you should wear that to the party.
what party?
our anniversary party.
our anniversary party? Why the fuck wasn't I...
what about Mitch?
you said you didn't want him to come.
I did? Yeah.
you said you were really embarrassed of him.
that's why I didn't invite him.
I can't believe I don't remember that.
you also said that you thought that he would get hammered and hit on all of our married friends, be mean to my grandma and turn the whole thing into a key party.
once, that happened.
and you said he would force everyone to do Kamikaze shots, spike the punch with ecstasy, and give all the girls breast exams and...
that was the same party.
hmm. Weird.
maybe we should talk about your bad memory at Dialogue Night.
stilton Coffee House tonight. Don't forget.
okay. Okay?
Bye.
hello.
this is District Manager Carla Nelson from the Atlanta Department of Parks.
Oh, yeah.
well, we have found that fountain.
it's been moved to 1100 Peachtree Boulevard.
you found it. Okay, well...
okay, we'll be there soon.
all righty, then. Have a good day.
thank you.
Hi. Hi.
how are you?
good. Just on my way to see Dave.
actually, all the senior staff is going to be at the mediation tomorrow.
so, I snagged Flemming's seats to the Marlins-Braves game.
you, me, beer, baseball.
what more could a guy want?
don't take this the wrong way.
I would really love to go to that game with you, but I don't...
are you breaking up with me?
what? I'm messing with you.
Oh!
look, it is just a baseball game.
they're dugout seats.
whatever you have to do, cancel it.
Hey.
they found the fountain.
Yeah, they did. She called me, too.
Yeah.
so...
good news.
Yeah, it's good news.
awesome.
we should probably go, you know, take a piss.
Yeah, yeah, let's do it.
Yeah.
except... Except?
except, the mediation is tomorrow, and I've been working my ass off on that.
Yeah, you've been working real hard on that.
and I want to prove to myself and to people that I can see that through.
and you should. Yeah.
you deserve that.
what are you saying?
we could wait.
you want to wait? We could wait a day.
push it a day? Or a week?
we should wait to switch. We can do it...
a month? Yeah.
it's time.
really, what is time?
come here, Dave.
come on, buddy.
this went so well. Yeah, it did.
it's kind of surprising.
very surprising.
if they offer you one red cent over $700 million, you accept that. Got it?
Yes, of course. Why wouldn't I?
why wouldn't you?
great! Good!
what's the worst that can happen? Nothing can happen!
I think it's fine.
Dave Lockwood.
did you forget something?
who is this? Your wife.
Oh.
ummm. Did I forget something? I don't know. What?
never mind.
it's the mediation tomorrow, so I'm under it.
I can't play.
so, how did it go? How much money is it?
just two hours, so, 14 bucks.
great.
sorry you got stood up.
he just forgot.
Yeah, that's what I meant.
he forgot me at the coffee shop when all I wanted to do was go and talk to him.
which isn't a lot to ask, do you think?
what do you want me to say?
well, have you ever been stood up by a man?
not really. Uh-huh.
our parents drive us places, though, so...
bottom line, Katie, is work always comes first, and we always come second.
and I don't think that's ever going to change.
I've got to go home now because I have this Spanish test, so...
I can write you a note.
I guess deep down,
I'm afraid that I'll keep compromising until getting the shit end feels normal.
and then I'll be so beaten down by life that, just for a second, I will consider asking the homeless guy at the car wash who looks like Kris Kristofferson to rub my shoulders.
and I will, and he will.
and you know what? It'll be wonderful.
and I'll love it.
because why not?
I mean, I'm not getting anything here.
nobody's fucking me here.
you know, Katie, this is exactly why people get divorced.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry. That was way out of line.
do you want some ice cream?
I'm not getting any closer to leaving, am I?
no.
Wow!
it's looking good out there.
Hudson loves the sinker. He's been crushing them all year.
listen to you, you are a big baseball fan!
Yeah, huge.
I didn't know that about you.
I was Phil Niekro for Halloween three years in a row as a kid.
no way! Phil Niekro is my number one favorite of all time!
why is my voice so high?
thank you for coming in today.
my name is Erin Walsh, and I'll be mediating your claim.
any and all agreements made during this mediation are binding and carry with them the full rights and responsibilities of the law as stated in Federal Code 325 A, Section 4.
Kinkabe agrees in principle to the terms of the sale and valuates your company at $625 million.
this is their best and final offer.
there is no way we can make this deal.
Six-twenty-five is not the end of the world.
you've just got to know when it's time to quit.
fuck that noise. We are not quitting.
I think you can do better, Ted.
I beg your pardon.
I don't see anybody headed for the door.
this is just like trying to fuck a Catholic girl who keeps saying, "No, I don't want to. I'm really drunk and you're circumcised.
but she keeps on making out with you, she's not leaving your Fiero...
it means she really wants to.
she just needs a little bit of a nudge.
a little bit of a coax, little bit of a tickle.
just to rationalize it to herself, to her God.
do you know what I mean?
no, Dave. We most definitely do not know what you mean.
okay. What I mean is, they want to spend more, and they just don't know it, all right?
if this really was their final offer, they'd be leaving, but they're not.
they're sticking around. They've got more money to spend.
she wants to unroll that rubber at the bottom of her purse that she put in there three semesters ago.
how much more do you think we can get out of them?
ten million? Fifteen?
pull those panties to the side, Ted, and take a hundred more.
what?
do not listen to him, Ted. He is beyond reckless.
if we make too large a counter offer, we risk driving them away.
Ted, it doesn't hurt to ask.
you would not believe the nasty shit.
I get these girls to do, just by asking.
honestly, it's revolting.
it does seem odd that they're not leaving.
punch her in the seat.
you can tell Kinkabe we want an extra 100 million.
and that is our final offer, because we're leaving.
fuel the jet, let's go.
for the record, I did not support that decision.
sir!
sir, Mr. Kinkabe has agreed to $725 million.
the deal is closed!
Oh, my God!
what did I tell you?
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Wow.
are you glad you came now?
am I glad I came? It's like the greatest day of my life!
where did that come from?
hang on, hang on, I got it.
Oh, no, they are going to call it.
man, this is amazing. - I can't believe they're making me partner.
I'm the greatest lawyer, ever.
what a day.
so, now you can be happy.
do you think they are going to give me a medal?
could you imagine an engraved sword?
honestly, I'd be happy with anything engraved.
a sword or a spear.
even a shield would be good.
slap it, Cara. Cara.
we are gathered here tonight to celebrate the newest partner in our esteemed firm.
david Andrew Lockwood was born on March 25th, 1974.
by all accounts, Dave was a sweet, diligent, hardworking little boy.
Wow.
Yeah, I know.
I love it.
Why?
it reminds me of high school.
I feel like I'm about to lose my virginity.
bathroom?
Yeah, right there.
do you want a drink or something?
or warm clothes or I can get you a drink?
no, it's okay. We'll have one after.
okay. After what?
relax, Mitch, you're going to get laid tonight.
in high school, Dave graduated first in his class.
after winning a full scholarship to Princeton,
Dave, amazingly, graduated in just three years.
and after graduating from Yale Law School with honors,
Dave clerked for Justice Souter on the United States Supreme Court.
work is hard.
I like going to baseball games and drinking too much, and getting tattoos at 3: 00 in the morning.
Yeah.
boot. Take it off.
we were not put on this earth to work, breed and die.
no, we were not... Don't interrupt me, handsome.
we are here to have fun.
right? Yeah.
boot.
I just think there's too many rules.
think about all the amazing experiences that we miss out on because we're so worried about what other people will think.
why can't I be a professional, successful woman who sleeps with someone she just met?
you know?
I haven't heard a word you said since you took your pants off.
shirt.
shirt.
you smell like lemons.
I do smell like lemons.
Oh, God, you're nervous. I like that.
your leg is shaking.
that's not my leg.
take off my bra.
all of it?
just the parts covering the breasts.
that's a good start.
Oh, that's great.
at the end of the day...
holy shit!
I am just tired of over-thinking things.
I'm tired of over-thinking things, too.
we should just do what we want to do.
let's do it. Let's just do it.
the only thing Dave loves more than the law is his beautiful wife, Jamie.
their life is like a fairy tale made even more perfect by their three adorable children.
so, as we celebrate one partnership tonight...
look, Daddy, it's you and me.
would bring most men to their knees, but not Dave.
he excelled on all fronts, putting the rest of us to shame.
I didn't earn this.
the work may be the first thing on Dave's mind, but his family has always been the first thing in his heart.
what should we do with each other, Mitch?
Oh, God, everything.
we could...
is that a...
is that a many-spotted skipper ling?
Yeah.
Mmm.
you can have whatever you want.
what do you want to do?
I want to go home.
what?
I want to go home.
what? I don't...
I got a meeting. I got to go.
Lockwood residence.
where is Dave?
Dave is at the country club. They made him partner.
a brilliant attorney, loving husband, devoted father.
it is my distinct honor to introduce to you, our newest partner, David Lockwood.
way to go, Dave.
congratulations, Dave.
you deserve it.
this is not my life.
is she kissing the wrong guy?
I know it's weird. Just go with it.
we tried to tell you.
you ready to take a piss?
you bet your ass I am.
I love you, pumpkin.
are you sure this is the address?
Yeah, this is the place.
you got to be kidding me. Oh, wow.
Jesus Christ, it's like the whole city is in here tonight.
okay, let's just do this. Come on.
how are we supposed to get this done?
you just be super cool...
and don't draw attention to yourself.
why aren't you peeing?
I got a lot of people around me.
don't yell at me. I'm all locked up.
no one is even looking at us. We're fine.
mommy, that man is peeing in the fountain!
Oh, my God.
the cat is out of the bag, buddy. You got to go now.
why don't you take a picture? Mitch!
come on!
it's snipped. Mitch! Mitch!
by the way, why didn't you invite me to your anniversary party?
okay, look...
I feel really bad about that but can we talk about that at another time?
there is a girl scout staring at my penis.
I want to talk about it right now.
Really?
are you embarrassed of me?
I'm sorry. Yeah. Yeah, I was.
but I'm not any more.
I'm actually proud of you, Mitch.
Really?
really.
Attaboy!
I think that's what had me all locked up.
Hey!
shit, we got security on us.
we got to do this right now.
I wish I had my old life back!
what did they say?
do you feel any different? No, go again.
I wish I had my old life back!
Oh, shit! Come on, guy!
we are running out of time here. Three, two, one...
I wish I had my old life back!
Bingo! Nice! Let's go, this way!
I'm peeing all over people, slow down!
watch it!
excuse me, I'm sorry. Pardon me.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, thank God. Oh, thank God.
pumpkin! Pumpkin, I'm back.
pumpkin, wake up.
can you wake up, baby? I'm back, I'm back.
Oh, my God, I missed you so much. Oh, honey.
okay, I owe you an explanation for last night.
I owe you an apology for this week.
and most importantly, I owe you a fix for the last five years.
honey, things are changing, I promise.
you and the kids mean everything to me. Nothing is more important.
in fact, I'm going to quit my job.
I'm going to work today, I'm going to quit my job.
I'm going to apply to Kinko's, all right?
or maybe Chick-fil-A or Waffle House? Whoa, whoa, whoa!
hold on, just a second. Foot Locker?
it is the middle of the night. Shh.
all right, I don't know what's going on with you two dorks.
that's enough.
I don't want you to quit your job.
what are you talking about?
you love your job and you love the law.
I love that about you.
I just want you to come home for dinner.
I know. And Dialogue Night.
and to see the kids.
and I want you to want to be here.
I do. You have no idea.
you don't have to get all, like, "I'm going to quit my job."
it's my turn. No, no, no.
back to bed. They're mine.
I love you.
Hi!
look who's up.
good morning.
Hi, my little man.
and how are you this morning, little princess?
good morning.
how was your sleep?
Yeah, I know.
okay, she's first.
she's a little bit more vocal.
right?
are you trying to tell me you've got a little surprise?
did you make me something special?
daddy.
Hi, sugarbug, come here.
give me a hug, sweetie.
good morning.
you smell like a pillow.
stay here, talk to me. Sit on that chair.
tell me about school.
I want to know what you learned yesterday, okay?
and I want to hear everything.
did you know that atoms are smaller than a grain of sand?
how amazing is that?
so amazing!
and everything on this planet is made out of atoms.
which is kind of strange because I think that means that I'm the same as a piece of fruit or a fish or this chair!
I'm me. God, I'm me. Thank you. Thank you.
God, look at that. Gorgeous!
God, it's so good to be back!
Oh, yeah.
welcome home. I missed you.
look at that, two perfectly shorn balls.
Hi.
I left my purse. I would have called, but...
but you left your phone in your purse.
Yeah. Right.
I just wanted to apologize, because I know that I probably came off a little aggressive last night, and I just wanted to say sorry.
no.
don't apologize. I apologize.
I probably came off a little gay last night.
I hope you will allow me the opportunity to straighten things out for you.
Hey, guess what? It's breakfast time.
do you want to get some breakfast?
Yeah.
dearly beloved, we are gathered here in the sight of God to unite this man and this woman in the...
Mitch, you came.
I'm very, very touched. Thank you.
you're welcome, Dad.
Ooh!
fuck me! This must be my new mom.
Hi, Mitch Planko.
good. Thank you.
she's holding onto me.
okay, good, let go.
keep away from him. The man's a pervert.
happy anniversary, Jamie and Dave!
for those of you who don't know me, my name is Mitch Planko.
I was that nut sack's best man 10 years ago.
here we go.
when we were kids, Dave and I, we had a lot of big plans.
Dave, he was going to be an astronaut, and I was going to sell dolphins on the black market.
astronaut!
there's a reason I'm not selling dolphins.
we live in Atlanta, they're tough to find.
and those things, they don't sleep, which also makes it real hard to catch them.
but I think that we all know that life doesn't always turn out exactly how you plan it.
sometimes, just sometimes, it turns out better.
Dave, I think there's a reason that you're not walking on the moon right now.
it's because you belong here, in your life, with that incredible woman sitting beside you.
can we please raise our Kamikaze shots to my two best friends, please?
to Dave and Jamie.
Dave and Jamie!
happy anniversary.
happy anniversary!
how did I do? You're such a poet.
you're Robert Frost. Who?
it doesn't matter. God, you're good looking.
Yeah.
I'm going to meet you in five minutes. All right.
okay.
I took care of you guys, huh?
we love you.
Oh...
come on. Really?
Hey, buddy. I love you.
I love you, man.
how are things going at home? Good?
Yeah. I mean, come on.
Yeah. Yeah, it's great. It's fantastic.
good. Yeah.
what about you? What about Sabrina?
good. It's good. We're taking things slow, but it's good.
is it weird that I miss your penis?
come on. It would be weird if you didn't.
what are we doing here?
we're doing this.
huh?
a little treat from Uncle Mitch.
do you remember how to do this?
okay.
Oh.
I know. Mmm.
it's fun, though, right?
Yay! Let's go look at some fish.
okay.
Oh, God!
Oh, my God!
Ow! What the hell was that? Oh.
explain yourself!
you've never heard of the Bryant Gumbel?
let's do that again.
Why?
Mitch sent us a video. Yeah? That's weird.
no entry!
steve Driver, you perfect bastard, you!
Oh, no.
Oh, Steve, it's like Christmas in my ass!
what are you doing with my wife, man?
Dimitri? - Hey, join the fuck party.
let's make lady sandwich. Okay.
Oh, my God. Not very well made, huh?
when was that shot? Who Knows? Probably years ago.
thank you for covering me last week. Love what you did with my hair.
Hey!
you got with a man?
Dimitri was surprisingly gentle, and we were very safe.
Uh-huh.
he smelt a little like lamb, though.
that pooper shot looked real. No. God, please, don't!
it did. Oh, God.
Dave? What?
can you change my oil?
no, I can't!
I'm gonna cut my thumbs off tomorrow, I swear to God.
and we're gonna destroy that thing first thing in the morning. Okay?
I don't want you to. I like it.
Hey, hey! Oh! It's growing in so nicely.
Yeah. Real in-between phase.
it's like Sonny Crockett down there.
towels.
lord Miraz?
you have a son.
the heavens have blessed us.
you know your orders.
general Glozelle?
Yes, my lord.
five more minutes.
won't be watching the stars tonight, my prince.
come. We must hurry.
professor, what's going on? - Your aunt has given birth...
to a son.
come.
you must make for the woods.
the woods? - They won't follow you there.
it has taken me many years to find this.
do not use it except at your greatest need.
will I ever see you again?
I dearly hope so, my prince.
there is so much more I meant to tell you.
everything you know is about to change.
close the drawbridge!
now, go.
Halt! - Halt!
a son! A son!
lady Prunaprismia has this night given Lord Miraz a son!
which of you superstitious old women wants to spend the night in a cell?
he's seen us.
take care of him.
No!
mind yourself, love. - I'm sorry.
watch where you're going!
wait for me!
you go to Saint Finbar's?
that's right.
I go to Hendon House. Across the road.
I've seen you...
sitting by yourself.
Yes, well, I prefer to be left alone.
me, too.
what's your name?
Phyllis. - Susan!
you'd better come quickly.
paper here!
get your daily paper!
Edmund!
go on! Kick him in the face!
stop it. Break it up. That's enough. Come on.
that's it. Get up.
act your age!
you're welcome. - I had it sorted.
what was it this time?
he bumped me. - So you hit him?
no. After he bumped me, they tried to make me apologize.
that's when I hit him. - Really?
is it that hard just to walk away? - I shouldn't have to.
I mean, don't you ever get tired of being treated like a kid?
we are kids.
well, I wasn't always.
it's been a year.
how long does he expect us to wait?
I think it's time to accept that we live here.
it's no use pretending any different.
Oh, no.
pretend you're talking to me. - We are talking to you.
quiet, Lu. - Something pinched me!
stop pulling! - Not touching you.
look, would all of you just... What is that?
it feels like magic. - Everyone hold hands.
I'm not holding your hand! - Just...
shame you're not as quick as me, Ed!
last one in's a rotten egg.
watch out!
here it comes!
wait a minute!
come on, Susan. Hurry up!
come on, it's lovely.
Edmund.
Ed? Ed!
what is it? - Where do you suppose we are?
well, where do you think?
well, I don't remember any ruins in Narnia.
wonder who lived here.
I think we did.
Hey, that's mine.
from my chess set. - Which chess set?
I didn't exactly have a solid gold chess set in Finchley, did I?
can't be.
don't you see? - What?
imagine walls.
and columns, there.
and a glass roof.
Cair Paravel.
wait. Wait, my lord. It is not what you think.
then what is it?
we're not exactly sure.
impossible.
I warned this council when it put its trust in Lord Miraz...
there would be consequences. - No.
we can't accuse the Lord Protector without proof.
how long are we going to hide behind that excuse?
until every chair in this chamber is empty?
lords of the council, my apologies for being late.
I wasn't aware we were in session.
no doubt you were otherwise occupied.
my lord?
ever since the death of Caspian the ninth, you've behaved as if you were king.
now it seems that from behind his walls even Prince Caspian has gone missing.
my deepest condolences, Lord Miraz.
imagine, losing your nephew, the rightful heir to the throne, on the very night your wife has blessed you with a son.
thank you, Lord Sopespian.
your compassion is a boon in this troubled time.
I trust you can tell us how such a tragedy could have occurred.
that is the most disturbing news of all.
our beloved Caspian was abducted by Narnians.
you go too far, Miraz.
expect us to stand by while you blame such a blatant crime on fairy tales?
what?
we forget, my lords, Narnia was once a savage land.
fierce creatures roamed free.
much of our forefathers' blood was shed to exterminate this vermin.
or so we thought.
but while we've been bickering amongst ourselves...
they've been breeding like cockroaches under a rock!
growing stronger. Watching us.
waiting to strike!
and you wonder why we don't like you.
well, I intend to strike back.
even if I have to cut down the entire forest,
I assure you, I will find Prince Caspian and finish what our ancestors began.
catapults. - What?
this didn't just happen. Cair Paravel was attacked.
don't suppose you have any matches, do you?
no, but...
would this help?
you might have mentioned that a bit sooner.
I can't believe it. It's all still here.
I was so tall.
well, you were older then.
as opposed to hundreds of years later... when you're younger.
what is it? - My horn.
I must've left it on my saddle the day we went back.
when Aslan bares his teeth, winter meets its death.
when he shakes his mane...
we shall have spring again.
everyone we knew... Mr. Tumnus and the Beavers...
they're all gone.
I think it's time we found out what's going on.
he won't stop staring.
so don't look.
here's far enough.
drop him!
crows and crockery!
"drop him"!
that's the best you can come up with?
a simple "thank you" would suffice.
they were doing fine drowning me without your help.
maybe we should have let them.
why were they trying to kill you, anyway?
they're Telmarines. That's what they do.
Telmarines? In Narnia?
where have you been for the last few hundred years?
it's a bit of a long story.
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.
you're it?
you're the kings and queens of old?
high King Peter, the Magnificent.
you probably could've left off the last bit.
probably.
you might be surprised.
you don't want to do that, boy.
not me. Him.
Edmund!
you all right?
beards and bedsteads!
maybe that horn worked after all.
what horn?
this bread is so stale.
I'll just get him some soup. He should be coming around soon.
I don't think I hit him hard enough.
Nikabrik, he's just a boy.
he's a Telmarine, not some lost puppy. You said you were gonna get rid of him.
no. I said I'd take care of him.
we can't kill him now. I just bandaged his head.
it would be like murdering a guest.
how do you think his friends are treating their guest?
Trumpkin knew what he was doing. It's not the boy's fault.
stop! Stop!
hold it. No, no!
I told you we should have killed him when we had the chance.
you know why we can't. - If we're taking a vote, I'm with him.
we can't let him go. He's seen us.
that's enough, Nikabrik!
or do I have to sit on your head again?
and you. Look what you made me do.
I spent half the morning on that soup.
what are you?
you know, it's funny that you would ask that.
you think people would know a badger when they saw one.
no. No, I mean...
you're Narnians. You're supposed to be extinct.
sorry to disappoint you.
here you go. Still hot.
since when did we open a boarding house for Telmarine soldiers?
I'm not a soldier.
I am Prince Caspian. The tenth.
what are you doing here?
running away.
my uncle has always wanted my throne.
I suppose I have only lived this long because he did not have an heir of his own.
well, that changes things. - Yeah.
means we don't have to kill you ourselves.
you're right.
where are you going? - My uncle won't stop until I am dead.
but you can't leave. You're meant to save us.
don't you know what this is?
you have quite a library, doctor.
is there anything particular you seek, my lord?
I think I've already found what I'm looking for...
in one of my soldiers!
what do you know of Queen Susan's horn?
it was said to be magic.
magic?
the Narnians believed it could summon their kings and queens of old.
at least, such was the superstition.
and what does Caspian know of this superstition?
my lord, you forbade me from mentioning the old tales.
so I did.
I will say this. If Caspian does know of the Deep Magic, my lord would have good reason to be nervous.
first our prince...
now his tutor.
if the members of Miraz's own house are not safe, - are any of us? - Lord Sopespian!
those are dangerous words, Lord Sopespian.
but these are dangerous times, general.
one should choose his words as carefully as he chooses his friends.
how long until the bridge is finished?
construction continues on schedule. - That's not good enough.
I need my army across that river now.
may I suggest you contribute some of your own men?
I've only so many at my disposal.
a fact you'd be wise to remember.
go to Beruna.
take as many troops as you need. We must get to Caspian before they do.
"they," my lord?
it's time you learned your history.
they're so still.
they're trees. What'd you expect?
they used to dance.
wasn't long after you left that the Telmarines invaded.
those who survived retreated to the woods.
and the trees, they retreated so deep into themselves that they haven't been heard from since.
I don't understand. How could Aslan have let this happen?
Aslan?
thought he abandoned us when you lot did.
we didn't mean to leave, you know.
makes no difference now, does it?
get us to the Narnians...
and it will.
Hello, there.
it's all right. We're friends.
don't move, Your Majesty.
stay away from her!
shoot, Susan! Shoot!
why wouldn't he stop? - I suspect he was hungry.
Thanks.
he was wild.
I don't think he could talk at all.
get treated like a dumb animal long enough, that's what you become.
you may find Narnia a more savage place than you remember.
I can hear you.
I just think we should wait for the kings and queens.
fine! Go then! See if the others will be as understanding!
or maybe I'll come with you.
I want to see you explain things to the Minotaurs.
Minotaurs?
they're real?
and very bad-tempered.
Yeah, not to mention big. - Huge.
what about centaurs? Do they still exist?
well, the centaurs will probably fight on your side.
but there's no telling what the others will do.
what about Aslan?
how do you know so much about us?
stories. - Wait a minute.
your father told you stories about Narnia?
no, my professor, he...
listen, I'm sorry.
these are not the kind of questions you should be asking.
what is it? - Human.
him? - No. Them.
there they are! - Run!
now!
Oh, no. - Wait. I'll go.
take it. Go! It's more important than I am.
get him out of here.
where are you?
choose your last words carefully, Telmarine.
you are a mouse.
I was hoping for something a little more original.
pick up your sword.
no, thanks.
pick it up! I will not fight an unarmed man.
which is why I might live longer if I choose not to cross blades with you, noble mouse.
I said I would not fight you. I didn't say I'd let you live!
Reepicheep!
stay your blade! - Trufflehunter?
I trust you have a very good reason for this untimely interruption.
he doesn't. Go ahead. - He's the one who blew the horn.
what? - Then let him bring it forward.
this is the reason we have gathered.
I don't remember this way.
that's the problem with girls. You can't carry a map in your heads.
that's because our heads have something in them.
I wish he'd just listen to the D. L.F. in the first place.
D. L. F? - Dear Little Friend.
Oh, that's not at all patronizing, is it?
I'm not lost.
no.
you're just going the wrong way.
you last saw Caspian at the Shuddering Woods, and the quickest way there is to cross at the river Rush.
but unless I'm mistaken, there's no crossing in these parts.
that explains it, then. You're mistaken.
you see, over time, water erodes the earth's soil, carving deeper...
Oh, shut up.
is there a way down? - Yeah, falling.
well, we weren't lost.
there's a ford near Beruna. How do you feel about swimming?
I'd rather that than walking.
Aslan?
it's Aslan! It's Aslan over there!
don't you see? He's right there.
do you see him now?
I'm not crazy.
he was there. He wanted us to follow him.
I'm sure there are any number of lions in this wood.
just like that bear. - I think I know Aslan when I see him.
look, I'm not about to jump off a cliff after someone who doesn't exist.
the last time I didn't believe Lucy.
I ended up looking pretty stupid.
why wouldn't I have seen him?
maybe you weren't looking.
I'm sorry, Lu.
kill him!
Telmarine! - Liar!
murderer!
all this horn proves is they've stolen yet another thing from us!
I didn't steal anything. - Didn't steal anything?
shall we list the things the Telmarines have taken?
our homes! - Our land!
our freedom! - Our lives!
you stole Narnia!
you would hold me accountable for all the crimes of my people?
accountable...
and punishable.
that is rich coming from you, dwarf.
have you forgotten it was your people who fought alongside the White Witch?
and I'd gladly do it again, if it would rid us of these barbarians.
then it's lucky that it is not in your power to bring her back.
or are you suggesting that we ask this boy to go against Aslan now?
some of you may have forgotten, but we badgers remember well, that Narnia was never right except when a Son of Adam was king.
he's a Telmarine! Why would we want him as our king?
because I can help you.
it's a trick! - At least hear him out!
beyond these woods, I'm a prince.
the Telmarine throne is rightfully mine!
help me claim it, and I can bring peace between us.
it is true. The time is ripe.
I watch the skies, for it is mine to watch as it is yours to remember, badger.
Tarva, the lord of victory, and Alambil, the lady of peace, have come together in the high heavens.
and now here, a Son of Adam has come forth...
to offer us back our freedom.
is this possible? Do you really think there could be peace?
do you? I mean, really?
two days ago, I didn't believe in the existence of talking animals...
or dwarves... or centaurs.
yet here you are in strength and numbers that we Telmarines could never have imagined.
whether this horn is magic or not, it brought us together.
and together, we have a chance to take back what is ours.
if you will lead us, then my sons and I...
offer you our swords.
and we offer you our lives, unreservedly.
Miraz's army will not be far behind us, sire.
if we are to be ready for them, we need to hurry to find soldiers and weapons.
I'm sure they will be here soon.
these ones! And these ones!
timber!
get back! - Watch your back!
look out!
steady, steady! - Timber!
perhaps this wasn't the best way to come after all.
so where exactly do you think you saw Aslan?
I wish you'd all stop trying to sound like grown-ups.
I don't think I saw him, I did see him.
I am a grown-up.
it was right over...
Lucy!
here.
Lucy, are you awake?
why do you think I didn't see Aslan?
you believe me?
well, we got across the gorge.
I don't know.
maybe you didn't really want to.
you always knew we'd be coming back here, didn't you?
I hoped so.
I finally just got used to the idea of being in England.
but you're happy to be here, aren't you?
while it lasts.
Lucy.
Lucy.
Aslan!
I've missed you so much!
you've grown. - Every year you grow...
so shall I.
where have you been? Why haven't you come to help us?
things never happen the same way twice, dear one.
Susan! Wake up!
certainly, Lu. Whatever you like.
wake up.
Aslan?
no, stop!
prince Caspian?
yes? And who are you?
Peter!
high King Peter. - I believe you called.
well, yes, but... I thought you'd be older.
if you like, we could come back in a few years...
no. No, that's all right. You're just...
you're not exactly what I expected.
neither are you.
a common enemy unites even the oldest of foes.
we have anxiously awaited your return, my liege.
our hearts and swords are at your service.
Oh, my gosh, he is so cute.
who said that? - Sorry.
your Majesty, with the greatest respect,
I do believe "courageous," "courteous," or "chivalrous"
might more befit a knight of Narnia.
well, at least we know some of you can handle a blade.
Yes, indeed. And I have recently put it to good use, securing weapons for your army, sire.
good. Because we're going to need every sword we can get.
well, then, you will probably be wanting yours back.
how much did they take?
enough weapons and armor for two regiments.
but... there's more.
you were right to fear the woods.
X? - Caspian. The tenth.
I apologize, my lord. The blame is mine.
I know.
tell me, general...
how many men did you lose?
none, my lord. - None?
they came like ghosts, in the dead of night. We never saw them.
then how do you explain your injuries?
I asked...
how many men were killed during this bloody Narnian attack?
of which you were a fortunate survivor.
general...
how many?
three.
I apologize, Lord Sopespian.
caspian is not a victim of this savage uprising.
he is the instigator.
it seems Narnia is in need of a new king.
well, it's good you have troops, but we need some fortifications. Somewhere to train.
so? What are they like?
malcontents, complainers, stubborn as mules in the morning.
so you like them, then.
well enough.
it may not be what you are used to, but it is defensible.
Peter. You may want to see this.
it's us.
what is this place?
you don't know?
he must know what he's doing.
I think it's up to us now.
it's only a matter of time.
Miraz's men and war machines are on their way.
that means those same men aren't protecting his castle.
what do you propose we do, Your Majesty?
we need to get ready for it. - To start planning for...
our only hope is to strike them before they strike us.
crazy. No one has taken that castle.
there's always a first time. - We'll have the element of surprise.
but we have the advantage here! - If we dig in, we could probably hold them off indefinitely.
I, for one, feel safer underground.
look. I appreciate what you've done here, but this isn't a fortress. It's a tomb.
Yes. And if they're smart, the Telmarines will just wait and starve us out.
we could collect nuts! - Yes! And throw them at the Telmarines.
shut up!
I think you know where I stand, sire.
if I get your troops in, can you handle the guards?
or die trying, my liege.
that's what I'm worried about. - Sorry?
you're all acting like there's only two options.
dying here, or dying there.
I'm not sure you've been listening. - No, you're not listening.
or have you forgotten who really defeated the White Witch, Peter?
I think we've waited for Aslan long enough.
professor?
I have to find him. - You don't have time.
you need to get the gate open. - You wouldn't be here without him.
and neither would I.
you and I can deal with Miraz.
and I can still get to the gate in time.
Yes, I'm a mouse.
we were expecting someone, you know, taller.
you're one to talk. - Is that supposed to be irony?
five more minutes?
what are you doing here?
I didn't help you escape just so you could break back in.
you have to get out before Miraz learns you're here.
he's going to learn soon enough.
we are giving him your cell.
don't underestimate Miraz as your father did.
what are you talking about?
I'm sorry.
thank goodness you're safe.
get up.
Caspian? - Stay where you are.
what are you doing? - I should think it's obvious, dear.
you know, some families might consider this inappropriate behavior.
that doesn't seem to have stopped you!
but you are not like me, are you?
it's sad. The first time you've shown any backbone...
and it's such a waste.
put the sword down, Caspian.
I don't want to do this. - We don't want you to either.
this used to be a private room.
what are you doing? You're supposed to be in the gatehouse!
No!
tonight for once, I want the truth.
did you kill my father?
now we get to it.
you said your brother died in his sleep.
that was more or less true.
Caspian, this won't make things any better.
we Telmarines would have nothing had we not taken it.
your father knew that as well as anyone.
how could you?
for the same reason you will pull that trigger.
for our son. - Stop!
stay right there. - You need to make a choice, dear.
do you want our child to be king?
or do you want him to be like Caspian here?
Fatherless! - No!
Caspian!
what's that supposed to mean?
we're under attack! - Sound the alarm!
men! Grab your bows!
Peter! - Our troops are just outside! Come on!
now, Ed! Now!
signal the troops! - I'm a bit busy, Pete!
Peter! It's too late. We have to call it off while we can.
no, I can still do this!
help me!
exactly who are you doing this for, Peter?
come on!
charge!
we're under attack!
attack! Attack!
for Narnia!
Archers!
pick a target!
take aim!
Ed!
get that gate closed.
fall back!
we need to retreat! Now!
go! Get her out of here!
back to the gate! Go!
Caspian! - I'll find him!
go! Get out! Go! Get out! Retreat!
follow me!
give the order.
my men are still down there.
draw back! Get out! Retreat!
now!
fire!
run for your life! Save yourself!
Peter! The bridge!
leave us! Go, brothers!
in the name of Aslan!
what happened?
ask him.
Peter. - Me?
you could've called it off. There was still time.
no, there wasn't, thanks to you.
if you kept to the plan, those soldiers might be alive.
if you'd stayed here like I suggested, they definitely would be!
you called us, remember? - My first mistake.
no. Your first mistake was thinking you could lead these people.
I am not the one who abandoned Narnia.
you invaded Narnia. You have no more right to lead it than Miraz does.
you, him, your father...
Narnia's better off without the lot of you.
stop it!
what are you all standing around for?
Telmarines will be here soon enough.
thank you... my dear little friend.
well done, lads. - Move it faster, mate. Too slow!
Beruna pledges its troops.
Galma pledges its troops.
tashbaan pledges its troops.
Ettinsmoor pledges its troops.
long live the king! Long live the king!
are you so glad of that magic horn now, boy?
your kings and queens have failed us.
your army's half dead. And those that aren't will be soon enough.
what do you want? Congratulations?
you want your uncle's blood. So do we.
you want his throne? We can get it for you.
you tried one ancient power. It failed.
but there is a power greater still.
one that kept even Aslan at bay for near a hundred years.
who's there?
I am hunger.
I am thirst.
I can fast a hundred years...
and not die.
I can lie a hundred nights on the ice...
and not freeze.
I can drink a river of blood and not burst.
show me... your enemies!
what you hate, so will we.
no one hates better than us.
and you can... guarantee Miraz's death?
and more.
let the circle be drawn.
wait.
this isn't what I wanted.
one drop of Adam's blood and you free me.
then I am yours, my king.
No!
stop!
come on! Come.
get away from him!
Peter, dear.
I've missed you.
come.
just one drop.
you know you can't do this alone.
I know. You had it sorted.
why did you never tell me about my father?
my mother was a Black Dwarf from the Northern Mountains.
I risked my life all these years so that one day...
you might be a better king than those before you.
then I have failed you.
everything I told you, everything I didn't, it was only because I believe in you.
you have a chance to become the most noble contradiction in history.
the Telmarine who saved Narnia.
you're lucky, you know.
what do you mean?
to have seen him.
I wish he'd just given me some sort of proof.
maybe we're the ones who need to prove ourselves to him.
Pete. You'd better come quickly.
cakes and kettledrums. That's your next big plan?
sending a little girl into the darkest parts of the forest? Alone!
it's our only chance. - And she won't be alone.
haven't enough of us died already?
Nikabrik was my friend too. But he lost hope.
queen Lucy hasn't. And neither have I.
for Aslan.
for Aslan!
then I'm going with you. - No. We need you here.
we have to hold them off until Lucy and Susan get back.
if I may...
Miraz may be a tyrant and a murderer...
but as king, he is subject to the traditions...
and expectations of his people.
there is one in particular that may buy us some time.
perhaps they intend to surrender.
no.
they are much too noble for that.
"I, Peter, by the gift of Aslan, by election and by conquest,
high King of Narnia, Lord of Cair Paravel and emperor of the Lone Islands, in order to prevent the abominable effusion of blood, do hereby challenge the usurper Miraz to single combat upon the field of battle.
the fight shall be to the death. The reward shall be total surrender."
tell me, Prince Edmund... - King.
pardon me? - It's King Edmund, actually.
just "King," though. Peter's the high king.
I know, it's confusing.
why would we risk such a proposal when our armies could wipe you out by nightfall?
haven't you already underestimated our numbers?
I mean, only a week ago, Narnians were extinct.
and so you will be again.
well, then you should have little to fear.
this is not a question of bravery.
so you're bravely refusing to fight a swordsman half your age?
I didn't say I refused.
you shall have our support, Your Majesty.
whatever your decision.
sire, our military advantage alone provides the perfect excuse to avoid - what might otherwise be... - I'm not avoiding anything!
I was merely pointing out that my lord is well within his rights to refuse.
his Majesty would never refuse.
he relishes the chance to show the people the courage of their new king.
you.
you should hope your brother's sword is sharper than his pen.
destrier has always served me well. You are in good hands.
or hooves.
good luck. - Thanks.
look.
maybe it is time you had this back.
why don't you hold on to it. You might need to call me again.
you might need to call me again? - Oh, shut up.
if it should appear to be going poorly...
understood, Your Majesty.
I hope you won't be too disappointed when I survive.
there is still time to surrender.
well, feel free.
how many more must die for the throne?
just one.
ride! - They've seen us!
take the reins. - What are you doing?
I'm sorry, Lucy. But it looks as if you'll be going alone after all.
are you sure you don't need that horn?
does His Highness need a respite?
five minutes?
three!
Lucy?
she got through... with a little help.
Thanks. - Well, you were busy.
I assume you won't let things get that close again!
you better get up there. Just in case.
I don't expect the Telmarines will keep their word.
sorry. - It's all right.
be careful.
keep smiling.
how does he look to you?
young.
but His Majesty's doing extremely well... for his age.
I think it's dislocated.
what do you think happens back home if you die here?
you know you've always been there, and I never really...
save it for later.
Respite!
respite.
now's not the time for chivalry, Peter!
show no mercy!
look out!
what's the matter, boy?
too cowardly to take a life?
it's not mine to take.
perhaps I was wrong.
maybe you do have the makings of a Telmarine king after all.
not one like you.
keep your life.
but I am giving the Narnians back their kingdom.
my king.
I'll deal with you when this is over.
it is over.
treachery! They shot him!
they murdered our king!
be ready!
Peter!
go!
to arms, Telmar!
to arms!
loose!
cavalry!
attack!
archers to the ready!
Narnians!
charge!
one, two...
three, four...
five, six...
take your aim!
stay with them!
eight, nine...
get ready!
now!
stop! Back! Back!
hold it now! Hold it!
now!
charge!
charge!
you're a mouse.
you people have no imagination.
loose! Loose!
Lucy?
back to the How!
cut off their escape!
loose!
loose!
brace yourselves!
back to the How!
crush them all.
Aslan!
I knew it was you. The whole time, I knew it.
but the others didn't believe me.
and why would that stop you from coming to me?
I'm sorry. I was too scared to come alone.
why wouldn't you show yourself?
why couldn't you come roaring in and save us like last time?
things never happen the same way twice, dear one.
if I'd have come earlier, would everyone who died... could I have stopped that?
we can never know what would have happened, Lucy.
but what will happen is another matter entirely.
you mean you'll help? - Of course.
as will you. - Oh, I wish I was braver.
if you were any braver, you'd be a lioness.
now, I think your friends have slept long enough, don't you?
come on!
Lucy.
for Aslan!
we can defeat them if we draw them to the river.
we must regroup. To Beruna!
to the bridge!
charge!
what is happening?
the river! - Retreat!
back! Back!
come on.
assemble on that bank!
you will not be harmed!
surrender your weapons!
take off the armor!
rise, kings and queens of Narnia.
all of you.
I do not think I am ready.
it's for that very reason I know you are.
thank you, Your Majesty.
thank you.
hail, Aslan! It is a great honor to be in...
I'm completely out of countenance.
I must crave your indulgence for appearing in this unseemly fashion.
perhaps a drop more?
I don't think it does that. - You could have a go.
it becomes you well, small one.
all the same, great king,
I regret that I must withdraw, for a tail is the honor and glory of a mouse.
perhaps you think too much of your honor, friend.
well, it's not just the honor. It's also great for balance.
and climbing. And grabbing things.
may it please Your High Majesty, we will not bear the shame of wearing an honor denied to our chief.
not for the sake of your dignity, but for the love of your people.
look! Thank you, my liege. I will treasure it always.
from this day forward it will serve as a great reminder of my huge humility.
now, where is this dear little friend you've told me so much about?
do you see him now?
because you have snuck in...
I'm sorry, but their future in that world shall be good.
your Majesty?
we are ready. Everyone has assembled.
narnia belongs to the Narnians, just as it does to man.
any Telmarines who want to stay and live in peace are welcome to.
but for any of you who wish,
Aslan will return you to the home of our forefathers.
it's been generations since we left Telmar.
we're not referring to Telmar.
your ancestors were seafaring brigands and pirates run aground on an island.
there they found a cave, a rare chasm that brought them here from their world.
the same world as our kings and queens.
it is to that island I can return you.
it is a good place for any who wish to make a new start.
I will go.
I will accept the offer.
so will we.
because you have spoken first, your future in that world shall be good.
where did they go? - They killed them.
how do we know he is not leading us to our death?
sire. If my example can be of any service,
I will take 11 mice through with no delay.
we'll go. - We will?
come on. Our time's up.
after all...
we're not really needed here anymore.
I will look after it until you return.
I'm afraid that's just it.
we're not coming back.
we're not?
you two are.
at least, I think he means you two.
but why?
did they do something wrong? - Quite the opposite, dear one.
but all things have their time.
your brother and sister have learned what they can from this world.
now it's time for them to live in their own.
it's all right, Lu.
it's not how I thought it would be...
but it's all right.
one day you'll see, too. Come on.
I'm glad I came back.
I wish we had more time together.
it would never have worked, anyway.
why not?
I am 1, 300 years older than you.
I'm sure when I'm older I'll understand.
I'm older and don't think I want to understand.
aren't you coming, Phyllis?
you don't think there's any way we can get back?
I've left my new torch in Narnia.
towels.
lord Miraz?
you have a son.
the heavens have blessed us.
you know your orders.
general Glozelle?
Yes, my lord.
five more minutes.
won't be watching the stars tonight, my prince.
come. We must hurry.
professor, what's going on? - Your aunt has given birth...
...to a son.
come.
you must make for the woods.
the woods? - They won't follow you there.
it has taken me many years to find this.
do not use it except at your greatest need.
will I ever see you again?
I dearly hope so, my prince.
there is so much more I meant to tell you.
everything you know is about to change.
close the drawbridge!
now, go.
Halt! - Halt!
a son! A son!
lady Prunaprismia has this night given Lord Miraz a son!
which of you superstitious old women wants to spend the night in a cell?
he's seen us.
take care of him.
No!
mind yourself, love. - I'm sorry.
watch where you're going!
wait for me!
you go to Saint Finbar's?
that's right.
I go to Hendon House. Across the road.
I've seen you...
...sitting by yourself.
Yes, well, I prefer to be left alone.
me, too.
what's your name?
Phyllis. - Susan!
you'd better come quickly.
paper here!
get your daily paper!
Edmund!
go on! Kick him in the face!
stop it. Break it up. That's enough. Come on.
that's it. Get up.
act your age!
you're welcome. - I had it sorted.
what was it this time?
he bumped me. - So you hit him?
no. After he bumped me, they tried to make me apologize.
that's when I hit him. - Really?
is it that hard just to walk away? - I shouldn't have to.
I mean, don't you ever get tired of being treated like a kid?
we are kids.
well, I wasn't always.
it's been a year.
how long does he expect us to wait?
I think it's time to accept that we live here.
it's no use pretending any different.
Oh, no.
pretend you're talking to me. - We are talking to you.
quiet, Lu. - Something pinched me!
stop pulling! - Not touching you.
look, would all of you just... What is that?
it feels like magic. - Everyone hold hands.
I'm not holding your hand! - Just...
shame you're not as quick as me, Ed!
last one in's a rotten egg.
watch out!
here it comes!
wait a minute!
come on, Susan. Hurry up!
come on, it's lovely.
Edmund.
Ed? Ed!
what is it? - Where do you suppose we are?
well, where do you think?
well, I don't remember any ruins in Narnia.
wonder who lived here.
I think we did.
Hey, that's mine.
from my chess set. - Which chess set?
I didn't exactly have a solid gold chess set in Finchley, did I?
can't be.
don't you see? - What?
lmagine walls.
and columns, there.
and a glass roof.
Cair Paravel.
wait. Wait, my lord. It is not what you think.
then what is it?
we're not exactly sure.
impossible.
I warned this council when it put its trust in Lord Miraz...
...there would be consequences. - No.
we can't accuse the Lord Protector without proof.
how long are we going to hide behind that excuse?
until every chair in this chamber is empty?
lords of the council, my apologies for being late.
I wasn't aware we were in session.
no doubt you were otherwise occupied.
my lord?
ever since the death of Caspian the ninth, you've behaved as if you were king.
now it seems that from behind his walls even Prince Caspian has gone missing.
my deepest condolences, Lord Miraz.
imagine, losing your nephew, the rightful heir to the throne, on the very night your wife has blessed you with a son.
thank you, Lord Sopespian.
your compassion is a boon in this troubled time.
I trust you can tell us how such a tragedy could have occurred.
that is the most disturbing news of all.
our beloved Caspian was abducted...
...By Narnians.
you go too far, Miraz.
expect us to stand by while you blame such a blatant crime on fairy tales?
what?
we forget, my lords, Narnia was once a savage land.
fierce creatures roamed free.
much of our forefathers' blood was shed to exterminate this vermin.
or so we thought.
but while we've been bickering amongst ourselves...
...they've been breeding like cockroaches under a rock!
growing stronger. Watching us.
waiting to strike!
and you wonder why we don't like you.
well, I intend to strike back.
even if I have to cut down the entire forest,
I assure you, I will find Prince Caspian and finish what our ancestors began.
catapults. - What?
this didn't just happen. Cair Paravel was attacked.
don't suppose you have any matches, do you?
no, but...
...would this help?
you might have mentioned that a bit sooner.
I can't believe it. It's all still here.
I was so tall.
well, you were older then.
as opposed to hundreds of years later... when you're younger.
what is it? - My horn.
I must've left it on my saddle the day we went back.
when Aslan bares his teeth, winter meets its death.
when he shakes his mane...
...we shall have spring again.
everyone we knew... Mr. Tumnus and the Beavers...
...they're all gone.
I think it's time we found out what's going on.
he won't stop staring.
so don't look.
here's far enough.
drop him!
crows and crockery!
"drop him"!
that's the best you can come up with?
a simple "thank you" would suffice.
they were doing fine drowning me without your help.
maybe we should have let them.
why were they trying to kill you, anyway?
they're Telmarines. That's what they do.
Telmarines? In Narnia?
where have you been for the last few hundred years?
it's a bit of a long story.
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.
you're it?
you're the kings and queens of old?
high King Peter, the Magnificent.
you probably could've left off the last bit.
probably.
you might be surprised.
you don't want to do that, boy.
not me. Him.
Edmund!
you all right?
beards and bedsteads!
maybe that horn worked after all.
what horn?
this bread is so stale.
I'll just get him some soup. He should be coming around soon.
I don't think I hit him hard enough.
Nikabrik, he's just a boy.
he's a Telmarine, not some lost puppy. You said you were gonna get rid of him.
no. I said I'd take care of him.
we can't kill him now. I just bandaged his head.
it would be like murdering a guest.
how do you think his friends are treating their guest?
Trumpkin knew what he was doing. It's not the boy's fault.
stop! Stop!
hold it. No, no!
I told you we should have killed him when we had the chance.
you know why we can't. - If we're taking a vote, I'm with him.
we can't let him go. He's seen us.
that's enough, Nikabrik!
or do I have to sit on your head again?
and you. Look what you made me do.
I spent half the morning on that soup.
what are you?
you know, it's funny that you would ask that.
you think people would know a badger when they saw one.
no. No, I mean...
...you're Narnians. You're supposed to be extinct.
sorry to disappoint you.
here you go. Still hot.
since when did we open a boarding house for Telmarine soldiers?
I'm not a soldier.
I am Prince Caspian. The tenth.
what are you doing here?
running away.
my uncle has always wanted my throne.
I suppose I have only lived this long because he did not have an heir of his own.
well, that changes things. - Yeah.
means we don't have to kill you ourselves.
you're right.
where are you going? - My uncle won't stop until I am dead.
but you can't leave. You're meant to save us.
don't you know what this is?
you have quite a library, doctor.
is there anything particular you seek, my lord?
I think I've already found what I'm looking for...
...in one of my soldiers!
what do you know of Queen Susan's horn?
it was said to be magic.
magic?
the Narnians believed it could summon their kings and queens of old.
at least, such was the superstition.
and what does Caspian know of this superstition?
my lord, you forbade me from mentioning the old tales.
so I did.
I will say this. If Caspian does know of the Deep Magic, my lord would have good reason to be nervous.
first our prince...
...now his tutor.
if the members of Miraz's own house are not safe, - are any of us? - Lord Sopespian!
those are dangerous words, Lord Sopespian.
but these are dangerous times, general.
one should choose his words as carefully as he chooses his friends.
how long until the bridge is finished?
construction continues on schedule. - That's not good enough.
I need my army across that river now.
may I suggest you contribute some of your own men?
I've only so many at my disposal.
a fact you'd be wise to remember.
go to Beruna.
take as many troops as you need. We must get to Caspian before they do.
"they," my lord?
it's time you learned your history.
they're so still.
they're trees. What'd you expect?
they used to dance.
wasn't long after you left that the Telmarines invaded.
those who survived retreated to the woods.
and the trees, they retreated so deep into themselves that they haven't been heard from since.
I don't understand. How could Aslan have let this happen?
Aslan?
thought he abandoned us when you lot did.
we didn't mean to leave, you know.
makes no difference now, does it?
get us to the Narnians...
...and it will.
Hello, there.
it's all right. We're friends.
don't move, Your Majesty.
stay away from her!
shoot, Susan! Shoot!
why wouldn't he stop? - I suspect he was hungry.
Thanks.
he was wild.
I don't think he could talk at all.
get treated like a dumb animal long enough, that's what you become.
you may find Narnia a more savage place than you remember.
I can hear you.
I just think we should wait for the kings and queens.
fine! Go then! See if the others will be as understanding!
or maybe I'll come with you.
I want to see you explain things to the minotaurs.
Minotaurs?
they're real?
and very bad-tempered.
Yeah, not to mention big. - Huge.
what about centaurs? Do they still exist?
well, the centaurs will probably fight on your side.
but there's no telling what the others will do.
what about Aslan?
how do you know so much about us?
stories. - Wait a minute.
your father told you stories about Narnia?
no, my professor, he...
listen, I'm sorry.
these are not the kind of questions you should be asking.
what is it? - Human.
him? - No. Them.
there they are! - Run!
now!
Oh, no. - Wait. I'll go.
take it. Go! It's more important than I am.
get him out of here.
where are you?
choose your last words carefully, Telmarine.
you are a mouse.
I was hoping for something a little more original.
pick up your sword.
no, thanks.
pick it up! I will not fight an unarmed man.
which is why I might live longer if I choose not to cross blades with you, noble mouse.
I said I would not fight you. I didn't say I'd let you live!
stay your blade! - Trufflehunter?
I trust you have a very good reason for this untimely interruption.
he doesn't. Go ahead. - He's the one who blew the horn.
what? - Then let him bring it forward.
this is the reason we have gathered.
I don't remember this way.
that's the problem with girls. You can't carry a map in your heads.
that's because our heads have something in them.
I wish he'd just listen to the D.L.F. in the first place.
Oh, that's not at all patronizing, is it?
I'm not lost.
no.
you're just going the wrong way.
you last saw Caspian at the Shuddering Woods, and the quickest way there is to cross at the river Rush.
but unless I'm mistaken, there's no crossing in these parts.
that explains it, then. You're mistaken.
you see, over time, water erodes the earth's soil, carving deeper...
Oh, shut up.
is there a way down? - Yeah, falling.
well, we weren't lost.
there's a ford near Beruna. How do you feel about swimming?
I'd rather that than walking.
Aslan?
it's Aslan! It's Aslan over there!
don't you see? He's right...
...there.
do you see him now?
I'm not crazy.
he was there. He wanted us to follow him.
I'm sure there are any number of lions in this wood.
just like that bear. - I think I know Aslan when I see him.
look, I'm not about to jump off a cliff after someone who doesn't exist.
the last time I didn't believe Lucy
I ended up looking pretty stupid.
why wouldn't I have seen him?
maybe you weren't looking.
I'm sorry, Lu.
kill him!
Telmarine! - Liar!
murderer!
all this horn proves is they've stolen yet another thing from us!
I didn't steal anything. - Didn't steal anything?
shall we list the things the Telmarines have taken?
our homes! - Our land!
our freedom! - Our lives!
you stole Narnia!
you would hold me accountable for all the crimes of my people?
accountable...
...and punishable.
that is rich coming from you, dwarf.
have you forgotten it was your people who fought alongside the White Witch?
and I'd gladly do it again, if it would rid us of these barbarians.
then it's lucky that it is not in your power to bring her back.
or are you suggesting that we ask this boy to go against Aslan now?
some of you may have forgotten, but we badgers remember well, that Narnia was never right except when a Son of Adam was king.
he's a Telmarine! Why would we want him as our king?
because I can help you.
it's a trick! - At least hear him out!
beyond these woods, I'm a prince.
the Telmarine throne is rightfully mine!
help me claim it, and I can bring peace between us.
it is true. The time is ripe.
I watch the skies, for it is mine to watch as it is yours to remember, badger.
Tarva, the lord of victory, and Alambil, the lady of peace, have come together in the high heavens.
and now here, a Son of Adam has come forth...
...to offer us back our freedom.
is this possible? Do you really think there could be peace?
do you? I mean, really?
two days ago, I didn't believe in the existence of talking animals...
...or dwarves... or centaurs.
yet here you are in strength and numbers that we Telmarines could never have imagined.
whether this horn is magic or not, it brought us together.
and together, we have a chance to take back what is ours.
if you will lead us, then my sons and I...
...offer you our swords.
and we offer you our lives, unreservedly.
Miraz's army will not be far behind us, sire.
if we are to be ready for them, we need to hurry to find soldiers and weapons.
I'm sure they will be here soon.
these ones! And these ones!
timber!
get back! - Watch your back!
look out!
steady, steady! - Timber!
perhaps this wasn't the best way to come after all.
so where exactly do you think you saw Aslan?
I wish you'd all stop trying to sound like grown-ups.
I don't think I saw him, I did see him.
I am a grown-up.
it was right over...
Lucy!
...here.
Lucy, are you awake?
why do you think I didn't see Aslan?
you believe me?
well, we got across the gorge.
I don't know.
maybe you didn't really want to.
you always knew we'd be coming back here, didn't you?
I hoped so.
I finally just got used to the idea of being in England.
but you're happy to be here, aren't you?
while it lasts.
Lucy.
Lucy.
Aslan!
I've missed you so much!
you've grown. - Every year you grow...
...so shall I.
where have you been? Why haven't you come to help us?
things never happen the same way twice, dear one.
Susan! Wake up!
certainly, Lu. Whatever you like.
wake up.
Aslan?
no, stop!
prince Caspian?
yes? And who are you?
Peter!
high King Peter. - I believe you called.
well, yes, but... I thought you'd be older.
if you like, we could come back in a few years...
no. No, that's all right. You're just...
you're not exactly what I expected.
neither are you.
a common enemy unites even the oldest of foes.
we have anxiously awaited your return, my liege.
our hearts and swords are at your service.
Oh, my gosh, he is so cute.
who said that? - Sorry.
your Majesty, with the greatest respect,
I do believe "courageous," "courteous," or "chivalrous."
might more be fit a knight of Narnia.
well, at least we know some of you can handle a blade.
Yes, indeed. And I have recently put it to good use, securing weapons for your army, sire.
good. Because we're going to need every sword we can get.
well, then, you will probably be wanting yours back.
how much did they take?
enough weapons and armor for two regiments.
but... there's more.
you were right to fear the woods.
X? - Caspian. The tenth.
I apologize, my lord. The blame is mine.
I know.
tell me, general...
...how many men did you lose?
none, my lord. - None?
they came like ghosts, in the dead of night. We never saw them.
then how do you explain your injuries?
I asked...
...how many men were killed during this bloody Narnian attack?
of which you were a fortunate survivor.
general...
...how many?
three.
I apologize, Lord Sopespian.
caspian is not a victim of this savage uprising.
he is the instigator.
it seems Narnia is in need of a new king.
well, it's good you have troops, but we need some fortifications. Somewhere to train.
so? What are they like?
malcontents, complainers, stubborn as mules in the morning.
so you like them, then.
well enough.
it may not be what you are used to, but it is defensible.
Peter. You may want to see this.
it's us.
what is this place?
you don't know?
he must know what he's doing.
I think it's up to us now.
it's only a matter of time.
Miraz's men and war machines are on their way.
that means those same men aren't protecting his castle.
what do you propose we do, Your Majesty?
we need to get ready for it. - To start planning for...
our only hope is to strike them before they strike us.
crazy. No one has taken that castle.
there's always a first time. - We'll have the element of surprise.
but we have the advantage here! - If we dig in, we could probably hold them off indefinitely.
I, for one, feel safer underground.
look. I appreciate what you've done here, but this isn't a fortress. It's a tomb.
Yes. And if they're smart, the Telmarines will just wait and starve us out.
we could collect nuts! - Yes! And throw them at the Telmarines.
shut up!
I think you know where I stand, sire.
if I get your troops in, can you handle the guards?
or die trying, my liege.
that's what I'm worried about. - Sorry?
you're all acting like there's only two options.
dying here, or dying there.
I'm not sure you've been listening. - No, you're not listening.
or have you forgotten who really defeated the White Witch, Peter?
I think we've waited for Aslan long enough.
professor?
I have to find him. - You don't have time.
you need to get the gate open. - You wouldn't be here without him.
and neither would I.
you and I can deal with Miraz.
and I can still get to the gate in time.
Yes, I'm a mouse.
we were expecting someone, you know, taller.
you're one to talk. - Is that supposed to be irony?
five more minutes?
what are you doing here?
I didn't help you escape just so you could break back in.
you have to get out before Miraz learns you're here.
he's going to learn soon enough.
we are giving him your cell.
don't underestimate Miraz as your father did.
what are you talking about?
I'm sorry.
thank goodness you're safe.
get up.
Caspian? - Stay where you are.
what are you doing? - I should think it's obvious, dear.
you know, some families might consider this inappropriate behavior.
that doesn't seem to have stopped you!
but you are not like me, are you?
it's sad. The first time you've shown any backbone...
...and it's such a waste.
put the sword down, Caspian.
I don't want to do this. - We don't want you to either.
this used to be a private room.
what are you doing? You're supposed to be in the gatehouse!
No!
tonight for once, I want the truth.
did you kill my father?
now we get to it.
you said your brother died in his sleep.
that was more or less true.
Caspian, this won't make things any better.
we Telmarines would have nothing had we not taken it.
your father knew that as well as anyone.
how could you?
for the same reason you will pull that trigger.
for our son. - Stop!
stay right there. - You need to make a choice, dear.
do you want our child to be king?
or do you want him to be like Caspian here?
Fatherless! - No!
Caspian!
what's that supposed to mean?
we're under attack! - Sound the alarm!
men! Grab your bows!
Peter! - Our troops are just outside! Come on!
now, Ed! Now!
signal the troops! - I'm a bit busy, Peter!
Peter! It's too late. We have to call it off while we can.
no, I can still do this!
help me!
exactly who are you doing this for, Peter?
come on!
charge!
we're under attack!
attack! Attack!
for Narnia!
Archers!
pick a target!
take aim!
Ed!
get that gate closed.
fall back!
we need to retreat! Now!
go! Get her out of here!
back to the gate! Go!
Caspian! - I'll find him!
go! Get out! Go! Get out! Retreat!
follow me!
give the order.
my men are still down there.
draw back! Get out! Retreat!
now!
get up.
what?
you fell asleep again.
just 5 more minutes, please.
no... Get up.
Hey.
late night?
I guess. - Again?
again. - Hm, same guy?
no. - Do I know him?
maybe.
does he know me?
good morning everyone.
good morning. - Good morning.
talk to me, Lawrence, what we have for specials?
lobster in white wine sauce. - Mh'hm.
what else? - Spinach and almonds.
Linguini in a tomato sauce.
that looks good.
more than 25 no-sugar for Marshalls wedding?
welcome back, Mr. and Mrs. Dunning.
so nice to see you again. - Nice to see you too.
you remember Sophie?
she'll escort you to your usual table, have a lovely meal.
follow me.
Sylvie, table six needs help with wine.
alright, thank you.
good afternoon. - Hi.
huh... Vivian just told me you need a wine recommendation.
Yeah, we're having the "Petite Filet."
um...
I would... highly recommend the 87 "Castle Chateau."
it's a beautiful Bordeaux. - Hm...
no, I haven't heard of it.
it's not on our list...
we have it on special reserve down in the cellar...
I think you really would enjoy it.
why, thank you, that would be fantastic.
be right back.
um, table 18 wanted their checks. - Okay.
what's the matter? Excuse yourself...
and get Vivian to do it. - You Sure?
going out for a quick cigarette, alright?
okay.
that was great suggestion, that "Chateau Castle."
it's one of my favorite.
Yeah, what other kind would you recommend?
that'd be depending on the meal.
well, if that's okay to figure that out, tonight over dinner?
I don't socialise with customers.
this is where my father and that fucking slut burned.
how the fire start?
the cops said they left the gas on and it exploded.
so, it was an accident?
yeah... That's what the Sheriff said.

Amen.

Amen. - Amen.

I don't know.
and now we bid farewell, of our brother, Nick Martinez.
I hope your father's rotting in hell.
that wetback piece of shit took away the best thing I ever had.
Hey! Leave the boys alone.

Oh, come on, don't you wanna roast some marshmallows?
I'm not a kid, mom.
Mariana, how about you? Just for a little bit?
I have to go to Kate's house, to study for a school project.
Bye, daddy. - Bye, sweetie.
I can't.
I just can't.
I'm sorry.
you may wanna brush up on the worst traffic light lamp...

Hey.

they haven't been here either.
I think we should check the Palms.
if we don't find them here. They're gone.
believe me, a Mexican with a 12 year old girl are pretty hard to hide.
we'll find them.
we just keep looking.
when was the last time you saw her?
I lost her two days after she was born.
Why?
I didn't deserve her.
teachers must really like you.
Hey, hon. - Hey.

Hi.
Hey, you never told us about Mariana.

What're you doing here?
I wanna see my daughter.

she don't want to see you. - Go away!
she don't wanna see you. - Maria!
Maria!
don't worry.
we'll think of something else.
Hey.
Hey!
Maria!

I beg you, just... - What do you want? What?

I'm very sorry, I ran away like that yesterday.

Maria, do you speak English?
you're all grownup.
I think about you all the time.
especially on your birthdays.
try to imagine what you look like.
you're so beautiful.
you know, you look just like your father.

Why?
his plane crashed.

I don't know.
he's a pilot.
he's a crop duster.
you don't know?
is everything okay?
your dad would like her to come to Mexico, we could take with us.
you think she'll come?
dear Lord, take care of us and everyone else. Amen.
okay... now bed.

I don't pray anymore.
that's wrong, Mariana.
lots things are wrong, mom, which can't be fixed by praying.
you've been acting so strange lately.
tomorrow I want you to tell me what's on your mind.
good night, sweetie.
good night, mom.
good night.
that girl who brought home the other day...
is her daughter?
Yes, sir.
are you fucking her?
why you doing this?
it's none of your business.
you can't be doing this shit to your mom.
stay outta this.
it's not enough what already happened?
it got nothing to do with this.
you gotta stop seeing her.
you understand?
do you... understand?
you enjoy betraying your family?
I'm talking to you, you son of bitch!
I'm not betraying anyone. - You're worse than your father.
you get to bring her home?
you're gonna be burned in hell with him.
I'm sorry.
get outta here!
what happened?
tell me it isn't true.
look at this.
tell me this is a lie.
did you actually sleep with him?
santiago, my dad is on his way to get you.
go down, and come get me.
what grade are you in?
the eighth grade.
do you have a boy-friend?
no.
do you?
I don't have a boy-friend.
jose Sanchez Martinez.
I wanna have the plastic surgery and a new breast.
don't do it... I like how you look.
the scar is so ugly.
you beat death.
you fought and won.
that makes your scar beautiful.
don't erase it.
get up, mom...
get up, mom... Get up, mom. Get up!
mom!
how's he doing, Doctor?
can the girl stay and listen? It's her dad.
there are some complications.
his leg is badly infected...
if the medicine won't help to clear it up...
we'll have to operate and amputate his leg.
can we go see him?
you can go and see him, but he's sedated.
Hi, daddy.
no, girl, not so close.
he's gonna be okay, right?
Yeah, he's gonna be fine.
I... I love you, daddy.
don't...
you can't stay here. You have to go.
let's go.
Maria, come on...
we have to leave, okay?
come on.
wait! Can I...
can I just stay a little longer?
I don't know, what she's saying.
it's his wife, she'd like to stay a little longer.
two minutes.
Santiago...
it's me...
Mariana.
you're not ready to die, are you?
because if you die, I wouldn't know what to do with her, and...
I can barely look her in the eyes.
she needs you.
and I need you.
I'm so scared.
I always was able to take care of myself and now I can't...
I can't run away anymore.
I killed them.
I killed your father and my mother.
I didn't mean to, but...
now I can't get... away from that smell...
from them burning, I can't get rid of it.
why did you wanted me to come back here?
Why?
Why?
Mariana, where're you going?
Mariana, stop! - Let me go!
I will tell dad.
tell 'em whatever you want.
Hey, Maria, you can sleep in your room, I'll sleep out here.
no, it's okay.
what happened?
nothing, I just burned myself once.
you know dad has the same scar in the same place.
he said he did it to never forget you.
so did I.
I have a scar too.
how that happened?
I fell when I was three.
are you gonna stay with us?
I do not know, I have to talk to him.
it's been a long time.
you're leaving then, aren't you?
I'm tired.
good night.
good night.
where are we?
that's Mexico.
What're we gonna do over there?
live in peace.
I'll never have peace again.
I'm pregnant.
what?
I'm pregnant and I don't want it.
we can go to Mexico to live. The three of us.
no, I can't. I can't have it.
can I talk to you a minute?
Maria...
you ever think you can forgive me for not...
for not being here all these years?
I left you because I was scared that you'd be like me.
that you'd come out like me.
you think you can forgive me?
please...
I'm going to go see my dad now.
hello. - Hello, Doctor.
how is he?
he's fine, we were able to drain the infection, reset the bones...
and put his leg in a cast. - He's not losing his leg?
no, he's not losing his leg.
we'll keep him under observation, for now everything looks good.
can I see him?
Yes, you can go and see him.
my dad's gonna be okay.
are you coming?
this was the best of all possible worlds.
but even here, a little help was necessary.
and that's where Troy came in.
Troy supplied feel-good pills to all the kids at Hillside.
and, in this way, happiness was spread all around.
life could not possibly be any more wonderful.
Lainie, listen, do you feel like something's missing?
has your energy level been noticeably low lately?
believe me, I know.
Lainie, believe me. Yes.
right. So if you would choose at this time to upgrade to the full platinum package, you would start to see the changes that I'm talking about.
no. No, I don't want you to think of these as vitamins.
son of a bitch. - Charlie!
I am doing VeggiForce.
level three. - Yes!
Oh, absolutely.
Lainie, can I?
can I tell you, it has completely changed my life?
you see?
it has given me an entirely new life system.
good for you, Lainie. Good for you! I'm so happy.
Oh, Dean, hello. It's wonderful to see you.
Troy's out back in his little hideaway.
Dean, do me a favor.
get him to turn his stereo down a bit?
sure. - Great. Thanks so much.
goodbye, Dean.
goodbye, Mrs. Johnson.
Dean, I was hoping to get your opinion on something.
can you come in here for a minute?
it'll just take one second.
publisher sent this over.
it's for promotional events. Book signings, lectures， TV.
you got a good eye. What do you think? Is it too much?
what do you want, Dad?
let's have a seat.
I want to talk to you about Troy.
I told you everything already. - You told us the facts.
we're interested in how you feel about it.
dad, who's we? - Your mother and I, of course.
and...
a lot of people. You threw us all for a loop there, pal.
hold on a second. Is this a therapy session?
is that what you're doing? - No, not at all.
you think I'm crazy? - Of course not, Dean.
we're just talking here. Man to man.
just talking? - Absolutely.
man to man?
OK.
Dean, I know Troy was your best friend.
actually, we weren't really friends. We hung out sometimes, that's all.
did you have a better friend than him?
I don't really have any friends, Dad. You know that.
so, strictly speaking, Troy was your best friend.
and how do you feel about the suicide of your best friend in the world?
real shitty.
come on, son, make an effort for me.
dad, I told you before. I'm not all broken up about it.
I know I'm supposed to be. I'm just not.
you're really not?
no, I'm sorry... - No, no. I...
I understand how someone might respond like that.
what are you writing?
dad, I thought we were just talking man to man here.
just one second.
dad, if you write about me again in another one of your stupid books,
I'm gonna kill you.
stupid?
there are several major book chains around this country - that would disagree with you. - All right.
the Happy Accident will pay your college tuition.
all right! - Fine.
let me ask you this.
Mrs. Johnson suspects that Troy might have been selling drugs to some of the kids at school.
yeah? - How do you feel about that?
I feel then it must have been unfulfilling for him.
that's very interesting.
why do you say that?
because he killed himself.
Dean, a young life was taken, and from the moment it happened, you ignored it like it was nothing.
you didn't even tell any of the adults at the party.
can you explain? - I didn't think you would...
what? ...care!
this is called Viloprex.
now, don't fight me on this, I prescribe this to lots of kids.
you want me to take that?
it's just something to give you a little balance.
OK, let me have it.
OK. Wonderful.
carefree LIVING HILLSIDE COMMUNITIES
Lee, can I get some by the end of the day?
Yeah, I'll see what I can do.
Lee. My dad's coming to visit this weekend.
I understand, but our supply is a little low right now.
prozac, Haldol, it doesn't matter. Anything to get me through till Monday.
I'm almost out of Ritalin. - Ritalin.
I gotta check. I don't know if we have it.
I still got a few left.
he's here all weekend. - I'll see what I can do, man.
got any Vicodin?
Hey! Psycho!
what happened to your boyfriend?
come on, he's all tied up and waiting for you, Dean.
don't ignore me, Dean.
don't ignore me!
don't ignore me.
here it is, Mrs. Bratley, with all the changes, exactly as you ordered.
I lowered the neckline just a touch.
the crystal beading, a special-order item, but we have to talk about that later.
the buttons, which are covered...
well, it's wonderful.
it's absolutely wonderful.
Oh... yes.
I can see the changes this time.
it's just really... It's amazing.
thank you, Mr. Mayor. We had to put a lot of projects on hold, but that's OK, because I think it's really...
Michael, you didn't even look.
anyway, the fit will be exactly the same.
so, if you like, I can ring it up for you now.
can I see the veil and the dress together?
can I do that? Can I see the two of them together?
I don't know that we can do any more alterations before Sunday.
I just want to see the two of them together.
I don't think I'm being unreasonable.
of course.
you all right?
I mean, after what Billy did this morning?
it's fine. I don't care.
I'm Crystal. - I know.
everyone knows who you are.
you don't like to talk much, do you?
or is it just that you don't like talking to me?
what do you want?
I just want to say I'm sorry, that's all.
Oh, you were a part of that? - No, but they're my friends.
the guys who did it. - Nice friends you have.
well, better to have no friends at all?
honestly? Yeah. Yeah, it is. Yeah.
you know that's why you get so much shit, right?
the way you act like you're smarter than everyone.
well, I don't torment people I don't know.
I thought you said you didn't care. - I'm talking about Troy.
since you can't apologize to him for this morning,
I guess apologizing to me is enough to make yourself feel better, right?
you know what? I was really wrong.
you're definitely not smarter than us.
and why is that?
because Troy was my friend.
how'd you know Troy?
are you apologizing to me now?
no.
you really don't care what people think, do you?
no.
that's a nice trick. - Thanks.
I studied in the far East.
maybe you could show me how it's done.
step one: Years of ridicule.
what if I start by sitting next to you?
it's probably not a good idea.
I'll take my chances.
how do you eat that stuff? - This?
pretty much in the standard way.
you know, if I ate that every day, I'd have a big, fat ass.
is that your greatest fear?
no, but...
...It's my mom's greatest wish.
that you be fat? - No. Just fatter than her, anyway.
sounds healthy.
is it true that you found Troy?
Why? - I'm just...
...wondering what really happened. - Just wondering?
you want me to tell you a bunch of gory details, is that it?
it's impossible trying to talk to you.
you know, I read this statistic that the average kid sees something like...
...10, 000 dead bodies on TV before he turns 18.
is that what it was like?
like TV?
no.
it was nothing like that at all, really.
how'd you know Troy?
listen, Dean, I should have asked you this...
Jesus! Crystal, just suck his dick, why don't you?
Billy. - Did you ask him?
ask me what? - Both of you guys get out of here, OK?
Oh. I don't think she asked him.
ask me what? What are they talking about?
here's the deal, psycho. Troy has something we need, and since you guys were such good butt-buddies, you're gonna go get it for us.
get what? Crystal, what's going on?
pills, dipshit.
pills, go get us the pills and maybe I won't have to kick your ass.
crystal, you were right.
I'm really not as smart as I thought I was.
I really believed you, you know?
wait, Dean... - You were right about something else.
it's not that I don't like talking.
no. It's just that I don't like talking to you.
when I am designing a family room, or an outdoor seating area,
I think, "What is the principle"?
the principle? - The guiding principle.
and I know you don't think in these terms...
it's about balance.
it's all about balance.
right.
Michael. - Yes, Terri?
can you pick up Charlie from school?
I think I'm gonna be here a little while longer.
OK, sure.
believe me, if I told you the story of how we met,
I mean, you saw the scar on his head?
he was almost killed. And I rushed over...
Hey, listen, Lou...
Hey, just because you're the mayor, it doesn't mean you're above the law.
you have to let Terri move on with her life.
you have to move on, yourself.
you might want to pay that ticket right away.
I'd hate to have to hit you with a warrant.
hold on, Lou. Let's talk about this.
two "F's" in Stiffle? - Hurry up.
there's two Stiffles.
what?
there's two Stiffles. Dean and Charlie.
who the hell's Charlie?
perfect vision. It's a gift.
which one of you is Charlie?
you're Charlie? - Yeah.
damn. You're teeny-tiny.
Hey, you wanna come with us? - No way.
look what we got.
what?
goddamn it, Lee. - There he is.
come here.
who the hell's that?
that is Dean's brother.
Hi. - Hi.
shit. My parents.
those kids again, Lee? - We're doing a group project.
with them, Lee? You think they care what grades you get?
mom. - Look, son, you let your grades go now, maybe you don't get into a top-tier school.
Yeah. - You don't get into a top-tier school, maybe you got to settle for a second-rate job.
maybe you don't have the life you want.
maybe each and every day you wake up and wanna crawl back into bed and tell the world to go to hell.
we're just saying, you've worked too hard to blow it in your last year.
we've all worked hard together.
so, come on, champ, hop in the car.
it's for school.
just look at our little man.
all right, Lee.
all right.
sorry about that, Mr. Parker.
can someone please answer the goddamn phone?
Hello?
ask for Dean.
is Dean there, please?
Yes, he is. Who may I say is calling?
it's Billy. - One moment, please.
telephone.
telephone, honey. Some boy named Billy.
all right!
what? - Dean?
what do you want? - We got Charlie.
who? - Your brother.
we kidnapped your brother. - What are you talking about, man?
I got him right now. He's scared shitless.
why did you kidnap my brother?
so you know I'm not fucking around. I want the stuff from Troy.
I all ready told you... - I don't think you're listening.
you are going to get me Troy's drugs.
or what? - Don't push me, psycho.
or what? - I'll kill him. I'm gonna kill him.
I'm not fucking around, man. I swear to God!
I'll cut off his fucking head!
fine. Kill him.
what did he say? - Maybe he really is crazy.
what did he say? - He said for us to kill him.
so, who are you guys calling?
your brother.
who? - Your brother, Dean.
I don't have a brother.
Charlie Stiffle? - Charlie Bratley.
Michael. Honey?
Charlie, Mom's home.
Charlie. Do I see your sheet music not put away?
Charlie, do I need to make dinner?
you're supposed to be the smart one, Lee.
we all messed up. Just forget it already, OK?
it's this one right here.
thanks for the ride. And the burger too.
wait.
I gotta get home... - Will you shut up a minute?
Billy, he has nothing to do with Dean.
maybe that doesn't matter.
honey, please open the door.
OK, I know this whole wedding thing is not easy for you, but it's not like I'm asking you to think of Michael as your father.
Lou will always be your father.
we're up here. - Terri, I'm glad you're home.
I had to leave work.
it's this book. I just can't put it down.
I was really hoping... - Wonderful, honey. A little later?
sweetheart, would you open another bottle for us?
OK.
what does he do? Really?
and is he? He is.
Yeah, well, I guess I could meet him, at least.
honey, I have to go. A bunch of handsome young men just came to visit.
OK. Ciao, baby.
Hello, boys. - Hi, Mrs. Falls.
it's Jerri, please.
who's this? - That's Charlie.
well, hello, Charlie. I don't think we've met.
Hi.
so what sort of trouble are you kids up to tonight?
we kidnapped Charlie to blackmail this guy into giving us a stash of drugs.
very funny.
except, we got the wrong one.
we wanted to get Charlie Stiffle, - but we ended up getting Charlie... - Bratley.
wait a minute, Bratley? Is? Is your mother Terri Bratley, the designer, Terri's Interior Visions?
isn't she getting married to the mayor on Sunday?
he's gonna stay here tonight, OK? - Sure. No problem.
can I get you anything? Some blankets, pillows...
mom, we're fine. - OK.
and what is this?
it's a tuba. - Wow.
maybe we could have a concert later? - Mom.
OK.
you kids have fun. I am gonna put on my bikini.
anybody wants to go for a swim...
but if you leave a message, I'll get back to you as soon as I possibly can.
Hi, Terri. Mrs. Bratley, I'm sorry.
your machine just cut me off.
my name is Jerri Falls, and I live in the Ocean Crest development.
anyway, I...
this is Terri Bratley... - Hi, I'm Jerri Falls...
Hello? - Dean?
Jesus. Can't you guys just leave me alone?
I'd love to, but I can't. - Oh, yeah? Why not?
I need your help. - Yeah, I doubt that.
you know it all, huh? - What do you want?
you know how Billy said he kidnapped your brother?
Yeah, that was a pretty lame bullshitjob, huh?
well, it wasn't all bullshit.
he did take a kid. He just took the wrong one.
wrong what?
the wrong kid.
even though it has nothing to do with you now, he won't let him go.
I don't believe you.
hold on.
Billy, get off of him.
Charlie, come here.
Hello? - Who is this?
this is Charlie Bratley.
did those guys kidnap you? - I think so.
that sucks. - I guess.
where do you live? - 25720 Sunnycrest.
what do you mean? I live on Sunnycrest.
Yeah. I know.
put Crystal back on the phone.
are you guys just fucking with me again, or is this real?
no, I think this is pretty real.
yes? - Hi. Is Charlie here?
he's not really in a talking mood.
but he is here. - I'm sorry. Who are you?
I'm Dean. - Isn't it kind of late?
it's for school.
OK. Come right in. See if he'll talk to you, at least.
his room is right there at the top of the stairs.
so, you're a friend of Charlie's? - No, not exactly. No.
Yeah. Charlie doesn't have a lot of friends yet.
he's not really socially gifted.
but he's a good kid, basically.
listen, I just... - Good night. Thanks for coming.
no, no, no. I'm still here.
wait, I've got an idea.
have you eaten yet? Why don't you stay for dinner?
honey, I don't think tonight is the best night.
but I can get that special-ordered, right?
Oh, Michael.
I don't care if you have to fly it in from the moon.
have it here by Sunday. Thank you.
Terri, wait. Wait.
is there anything else?
Yeah. Could you tell Charlie I said goodbye?
OK. - OK.
Hello, Allie.
Carrie, hi. How are you?
am I interrupting? - No, come in.
I'm just in the middle of making dinner.
would you like a glass of wine? - Well, I left the car running.
I just wanted to come back and return your dish and say thank you.
it has been such a relief to not have to cook lately.
everyone has been so nice.
what?
this dish...
Oh! Oh, my God.
this is not the right one?
I got so many, I mean,
I've been driving around all night returning them.
like I say, everyone has been so nice.
I don't believe I brought over a casserole.
can you hang on just one second, Carrie?
Allie, am I making a mistake here?
bill and I were meaning to come over, really.
you just get so busy.
no, but I'm certain.
I mean, you came over, we had coffee.
we talked, right?
or am I...
...just imagining the whole thing?
is that what I'm doing here? Am I just...
...imagining all of it?
I'm sorry, Carrie. You just get so busy sometimes.
I'm so embarrassed.
I don't know what I was thinking.
here you are, preparing a nice family dinner...
would you like to stay and eat with us?
and I come in and interrupt everything with no reason at all.
why don't you stay? - I really can't.
I have so many dishes to return.
everyone has been just so unbelievably nice.
so, we'll see you on Sunday? - Sunday?
don't tell me that I forgot your invitation too?
Troy's memorial. It's this Sunday.
of course, Carrie. Right. We're looking forward...
we'll be there.
and...
...I wanted to let you know, just in case you were wondering...
yes?
in no way, whatsoever, do I blame you for Troy's death.
good night.
crystal, come over here. We're gonna have a concert.
I'm fine here, Mom. - Baby, don't be shy.
she's been filling out a little bit lately.
which is completely natural for your age.
I just hope I look as good as you at 35, Mom.
go ahead, Charlie.
yeah?
I mean, you are 35, right?
actually, I'm 39, sweetheart, you know that.
you're 39? - Anytime, Charlie.
I don't have my sheet music.
the only one I know by heart is Tequila.
well, for someone almost 40, you look great, Mom.
well, thank you so much, sweetheart.
40 years old. Wow. - There's no real... I don't know.
the marching band, the melody doesn't go to the tuba.
we know the tune. We'll recognize it. - More wine, Jerri?
I would love some. You are such a charmer.
did you know I'm going to the Air Force after graduation?
did you know that? - No.
they accepted me for the pilot training program.
just like your dad, right?
no. No, he was just a mechanic.
he couldn't even pass the eye test, but me, perfect vision.
it's a gift. - It's wonderful.
just wonderful.
miss Falls? - Jerri, please.
any time. Let's do it.
I live in the city.
in an apartment above the cloud left by the blast.
I'm one of the lucky ones.
one morning,
I woke to find that my head was no longer attached to my body.
I'm not dead, but who could call this a life?
get ready to die.
so I did what I had to do.
in a world of freaks and subhuman creatures...
...I became the Chumscrubber.
Hello? - Crystal?
Yeah, it's me. - Hi...
listen, I just want to ask you something.
when this whole thing is over and we see each other at school, or wherever...
yeah?
I don't really know how to say this...
no, what is it?
well, it's...
can you just...
...leave me alone?
what? - No, I mean it.
leave me alone. - I didn't mean for this all to happen.
don't try to act like you know me.
don't bother me, don't ever talk to me again.
why the hell would I want to talk to someone like you?
exactly.
I'll get you Troy's pills tomorrow.
let's go, Michael. We have a million things to do today.
Terri, could we slow down for a minute?
I was up all night... - Morning!
I really want to talk to you about this book.
certainly a lot of activity around your house lately.
well, I am getting married tomorrow.
I know. That's just so wonderful.
I did want to ask, I don't mean to be rude...
go ahead. - Well...
your people are parking just wherever they like.
and the cleaning crew?
those Mexican folks, they backed right into my yard.
look, you can see. Just right up over the flowers.
not a word of apology.
you mind if we deal about this a little bit later on?
I didn't mean to cause a problem, especially now, while you're preparing for your wonderful wedding.
I have a million things to do today.
I know what you mean, because I'm having the service for my son tomorrow and I have things to prepare, as well.
and I will definitely need my fair share of parking spaces for my guests.
I understand. - I don't mean to be a nuisance.
not at all. - But I did want to tell you, just in case you're wondering, in no way, whatsoever...
point taken!
I can't believe the nerve of that woman.
she knew it was my wedding this Sunday.
can't she find another date for her memorial?
Dean? Honey? Breakfast!
were you watching me?
no.
I must've been slobbering all over myself like a retard, huh?
you look nice.
I bet.
come smoke with me. - OK.
have a seat, it's all ready.
turn off your game now. - Shit, Mom.
what did I tell you about swearing in this house?
you're against it? - Right. I am against it.
I'm not hungry. - Just have some eggs, then.
OK, I've gotta go. - What?
I've got a meeting with the agents. We're talking foreign distribution.
bill, it's Saturday.
I was hoping we could all do something together as a family.
I'm not going anywhere. - Has anyone seen my case?
that's a great attitude. - Welcome.
I just brought it out. I just had it. - Dean, you have to eat something.
I just said I'm not hungry.
it's just a side effect of the medication.
isn't there a more natural way we could treat his problem?
my problem? - A bunch of vitamins isn't gonna help.
they're not just vitamins.
I could really use an extra set of eyes here.
I could make you some pancakes. - Mom, no, I don't want pancakes.
I'm fine, Mom. I'm fine.
anyway, I have to go. - What? No.
where are you going? - Do I have to explain everything I do?
I'm just meeting some friends. - Really?
don't act too surprised, Mom. - No, why would I be?
cause no one likes him, Mom. - Oh, Charlie.
everyone thinks he's crazy.
I'm asking everyone. Has anyone seen my case?
it's right here on the goddamn, son-of-a-bitch counter!
all right, Mom.
how old are you? - Thirteen.
then why are you so small? - I don't know.
just am.
my dad put me on this Bulk 2000 for awhile, this powder stuff, it ended up costing him $400, but after a couple of weeks,
I got really bad diarrhea.
I ended up losing, like, eight pounds.
you don't smoke, do you?
sure. Well, no.
here's a secret.
don't act like somebody you're not.
you do that long enough, you'll forget you were acting.
and so will everyone else.
I was actually thinking of going out for marching band.
seems that's what the chicks are into, right?
Yeah, that's right, Billy. Charlie nailed me all night long.
it was unreal.
what the hell did you do that for?
cause I'm a stupid bastard.
let's get the fuck out of this place.
my mom gave this to me on my 12th birthday.
I always hated this stupid thing.
Hello, Debbie? It's Carrie. Johnson.
Oh, I guess it is early.
right. Well, I'm calling because I just wanted to tell you, in case you were wondering, that in no way, whatsoever, do I blame you for Troy's death.
Hello, Timmy? Is your mommy there?
well, can you take a message, sweetie?
all right, write this down.
in no way...
don't ignore me, Dean.
I didn't know we were entertaining.
we're just going to my room for a while.
who's the kid?
Charlie. - Damn, you're teeny-tiny.
I'm holding him for ransom.
Yeah, I should probably get home. My mom's getting married tomorrow.
I was married once.
problem was, if my wife never really...
we're just gonna go inside.
I'm sorry.
come on, let's go.
come here, shitballs. I'm gonna teach you something.
come here.
come here.
listen, if someone tries to kick your ass in high school...
to be honest, you're probably gonna get your ass kicked anyway.
but if you weren't such a pussy, you could try this.
all right. Come at me like you're gonna hit me in the chest.
hit me right here in the chest. Come on, hit me right here.
no, man, like really do it like you got a pair.
really do it. Come on, come on.
that was good. That was good.
he's about half your size. - Are you all right?
are you fucking kidding me?
what are we doing here? We're fucking kidnapping this kid.
am I the only one that fucking remembers that?
gordon shaw, age 41, actor.
found dead by the maid at 2.am in the pool house.
cause of death?
cause of death? - Doesn't say.
what do you mean it doesn't say?
look at the size of that driveway, my word.
what did he die of?
doesn't say.
that's supposed to be the most thorough book available. Let me see that.
Fritz, how did Gordon Shaw die?
autoerotic asphyxiation.
what in the world is that?
doesn't say.
here we go with the phone.
Brenda Leigh, I thought you said you were taking the day off.
I did.
Hi, Sergeant Gabriel.
Yes.
I can't believe I left my mother alone with Fritz for the whole day.
she'll be fine. - I'm not worried about my mother.
hold on to your hat, chief.
we got a gang related shooting.
in this neighborhood? - No.
and, uh, your buddy's here again.
I'm used to commander Taylor showing up at our crime scenes.
what are we doing showing up at one of his?
3 victims. Automatically a priority.
2 dead, 1 over at county, and by the way, Taylor knows one of the victims.
OK. Who wants to catch me up?
I ran the plates.
the suv is registered to a Ronald Talmadge.
44 of Ladera Heights.
paramedics say it's from the IDs they got off the occupants.
driver was Wesley Talmadge. Black, 19.
probably the owner's son. Passenger in the front, Myra Singleton.
also black, also 19. Driver's license says she's from San Diego.
and our survivor?
Theresa Hoover. White. 20. She's in surgery right now.
so who reported this?
some old lady. Couple of blocks away. Called in as shots fired.
casings are from a tech-9.
my guess, they started shooting from about here.
then they drove off, or ran.
deputy chief Johnson.
nice of you to cut your vacation short.
it was only a day off, commander.
I understand you knew the victim.
go ahead.
I know his father.
only met Wesley a couple of times. Good kid.
sorry, commander.
I know what this looks like, chief. This kid's no gangster.
so I take it as a personal favor if you give this case all the energy you give to your high profile victims.
I give all my energy to all my cases. That's my job.
no need to consider it a favor.
fine.
I know his parents will appreciate it.
any weapons in the car? - Nothing visible.
we're waiting for S. I.D. To give it the once over, then we'll bring it down to the lab.
OK.
it's all yours. Thank you.
so what is a good kid like Wesley doing in a place like this?
he was in a gang neighborhood driving a car with "shoot me" written all over it.
Figueroa leads right into the university. The kid's from Ladera up the hill.
he's got to go through this neighborhood to get to school. Maybe he just got caught up in a random drive by.
I'm not a big fan of random. Got shot in the head.
probably never saw it coming. Anybody see anything?
everyone saw everything and no one saw nothing.
this is 5-3 territory 48th up to gage.
5-3 and 6-deuce are in a gang war.
and this whole thing looks like a standard issue gang hit.
please get in touch with gang intelligence and have them round up the most active 6-deuces.
and then pull all the reports of gang shootings over the past couple of weeks.
lieutenant tao, please finish processing the scene. Find out what we can about the weapons involved.
lieutenant Flynn, I'd like you to head on over to county.
I want someone there when Theresa Hoover gets out of surgery.
and Lieutenant Provenza, if you could get in touch with San Diego county sheriff's department for the notification of Myra Singleton's parents.
we'll handle the Talmadges. Thank you, everyone. Thank you very much.
man, this notification has got to be one of the hardest parts of your job, huh?
it is. But I'm not doing my job today.
you are.
we need them to talk to us.
so don't say you're from homicide. Just say Lapd.
when people see you at their door, and you say homicide, you lose them.
and any chance of learning something useful.
Hello, Mrs.Talmadge. I'm detective Gabriel. Lapd.
detective johnson.
ask if anyone else is there.
just in case they pass out when they hear the news.
I had a single mother once who fainted.
slammed her head on the coffee table, and I was stuck waiting for an ambulance with a bleeding, unconscious woman.
is, uh, is there anyone else at home, ma'am?
my husband is in the kitchen. Why, is there something wrong?
what's going on?
is there something wrong?
is it Wesley?
answer any question they have with another question.
you need to find out if they saw their son.
might even tell us something about their relationship with him.
maybe even who he hangs out with.
sir, have you seen or talked to your son today?
I haven't seen him. He came by earlier to borrow the car, but we were out, why?
what's going on? - What is this?
is he ok?
please, tell me that Wesley is ok.
how you say it is up to you.
there was a shooting this afternoon off of Figueroa, and your son Wesley was involved, and I'm very sorry to say that he did not make it.
once you tell them, watch closely how they react.
what's the first thing they think of.
you're lying. No, you are lying!
no. - This is all your fault!
I told you this would happen!
honey, take it easy.
get away from me! It's all your fault!
now, get ready.
you're about to become the main character in the story of someone's worst day ever.
it's your fault!
it's your fault!
I ain't heard nothing about no shooting.
you ain't heard about a black escalade taking 40 rounds 10 blocks from your building?
nothing. It wasn't us, man. We didn't do it.
and we ain't about to lose no sleep over it either.
ain't no shame in poppin' no 5-trey.
my ass hurts sittin' down here.
Hey, you my Johnny or what?
Hey, where you going?
do you know how to count?
what's with the outstanding citizen convention in the hall?
I had the gang squad haul in the most active 6-deuces.
we think this might have been some kind of tit for tat in their war with the 5-3s.
is that the official legal term for revenge killing now,tit for tat?
trying to find out the connection between Wesley Talmadge and the 5-3s.
commander taylor told me there is no connection.
well, tell him to leave the evidence proving that on my desk.
take off your shoe.
Oh, I love when he does this.
you ain't got nothing on me. I don't even have to tell you nothin'.
take off your shoe.
you kicked me.
you have the right to
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, man, wait.
OK, ok. Ok.
it's good to see you're having a positive effect on your people.
is this Talmadge boy a 5-3?
I don't know, man.
wait, wait, wait, wait.
is this Talmadge kid a 5-3?
look, man. I don't have nothing 'cause it ain't nothing to give.
people brag aboutthis kind of thing. Especially 187 on a 5-trey.
ain't nobody sayin' nothin'.
I'll make it up to you, Fritz, I swear.
no. No, no. I'll probably be late.
I'm sorry. Bye.
OK, what do we know about the boy?
teachers liked him. Played high school soccer.
he got into USC on grades and his sats.
never been arrested. Never had a traffic ticket.
kid was clean as a safeway chicken. - What about the murder weapon?
slugs and casings all came from the same gun. Tech-9.
what about Wesley, any weapons?
no weapons in the vehicle or on his person.
also, nothing registered to Wesley or his parents.
what about the parents?
well, it's just that when we did the notification, Mrs. Talmadge seemed to put the blame on the father.
she kept saying,"this is your fault. This is your fault."
maybe someone thought they were shooting at the father.
or the girlfriend.
it's not just the boys get caught up in these wars.
I don't know. This is a good kid. Lots of friends. Deans list at USC.
MYRA Singleton's the type of girl a guy takes home to meet his mother.
only one little problem. Myra Singleton wasn't the girlfriend.
Theresa Hoover was.
Theresa's still sedated, but her roommate was there.
Wesley and Theresa have been dating for 5 months.
everyone thinking what I'm thinking?
thank you for coming. Have a seat.
we're tired. We haven't slept.
we've got a funeral to plan. Family in the house.
do you have news about who killed our son?
nothing I can share just yet.
but it would be very helpful if you could just clarify a few things.
um, Lynn, the other day, you said that this was Ronald's fault.
what did you mean by that?
I didn't know what I was saying.
I don't remember anything after...
after he told me that...
my baby... was dead.
Lynn wanted Wesley to go to a small college away from L. A.
she wanted to protect him from all the gangs and drugs.
I encouraged him to go to USC. It's where I went to school.
does Wesley know anyone who was involved with gangs?
absolutely not.
not all young black men turn into gangsters.
we brought Wesley up to stay away from those kind of people, and he always has.
I'm not trying to make him into something he's not.
I'm trying to find who took your son from you.
and that's gonna require me finding out everything I can about your family.
you two had, uh, two vehicles registered in your name.
the Escalade and the Acura Sedan.
which one did you usually drive?
the Acura's Lynn's, I drive the Escal
wait a minute, you-- you think they were trying to kill me?
we have to look at all the possibilities.
your company did a lot of good in some very bad neighborhoods.
a lot of gangs have a vested interest in things staying bad.
how often did Wesley use your car?
well, he has
he had his own.
a camry. But it's, it's getting old.
so he would borrow our Escalade sometimes on the weekend or to take his girlfriend out.
how well did you know Wesley's girlfriend?
you know boys. Always embarrassed by their parents.
so you never met Theresa.
Wesley's girlfriend.
Theresa and Wesley were just friends from English class.
who told you they were dating? - Her roommate.
would wesley have any reason to think that you two wouldn't approve?
to be honest?
if I knew Wesley was in an interracial relationship,
I'd be more worried for him than happy.
I mean, there are a lot of people out there who still can't see past black and white.
is that what you think might have happened here?
I don't know yet.
but I have to wonder if he kept this a secret, what else was he keeping from you?
all right. We'll be there in about 20 minutes. Great.
Theresa Hoover is awake, and the doctor said she's getting her strength back.
good. Listen, I'd really appreciate it if you didn't mention anything about Fritz.
you didn't tell your mom about Fritz?
of course I told my mom about fritz. Just not some of the details.
and I don't have time to tell you which one, so let's just leave them all out, ok?
OK, is there anything else I should avoid?
politics, religion.
the atlanta braves. Vegetarianism.
just smile and wave, ok? - Ok.
Hey, mama.
Hey.
Oh, mama. What have you been doing in here?
cleaning. I haven't had the courage to tackle the bedroom yet.
you didn't need to do all this.
well, somebody did. And you've been working all day.
besides, a person can't walk anywhere in this city.
that's why I rented you a car.
well, I don't trust l. A. Drivers. Everybody's always talking on their portable telephones.
any mail?
Oh.
we didn't meet individually at the police station.
I'm Willie Ray Johnson.
Brenda's mother, and you are?
sergeant, uh... David Gabriel.
nice to meet you.
mama, have you seen my glasses?
no, dear. Sorry. Try your room.
OK.
so...
david gabriel. - Yes, ma'am.
I spent a lovely day yesterday with Brenda's friend Fritz.
do you know him?
Hey.
so I checked into your murder with some of my guys, they know the 5-3, 6-deuces pretty well.
consensus is this was a clear case of retribution in their war.
well, so far, I can't find any evidence that Wesley Talmadge was even in a gang.
Brenda, I know Taylor wants to believe that Talmadge was an altar boy, but everything about this shooting points to a not very original conclusion.
the kid was a weekend gangster, he got shot for it.
you're right.
that's not very original.
by the way, have you seen my glasses?
maybe you left them at my house. Oh, no, wait.
I don't have a house. I live out of a U-haul.
honestly, Mrs.Johnson, your daughter and I don't discuss too much personal stuff.
but surely you've met him. - I don't think so. No.
you've never met him? - No.
that's funny because Fritz said that he's worked a couple of cases with your squad.
Oh, Agent Howard.
Oh, his name is Fritz? That's a great name, Fritz.
mama, I can't find my glasses anywhere.
Oh... here. Borrow mine.
Oh, thank you.
there's nothing to read in this house anyway.
we, um, we met in an English seminar.
modern poetry.
he came up to me after the first class.
he was really funny, and, uh...
he asked me to go to dinner and to see a movie.
he was really into movies.
dinner and a movie. Is that where the two of you were headed?
no.
I read about this new club downtown.
Wesley liked to take his dad's car to that kind of thing.
so we went over to his parents house in the afternoon to pick it up.
what was Myra Singleton doing with you?
Yeah.
well, we were just kind of in the habit of bringing along a third.
especially in certain neighborhoods.
because?
because people aren't exactly supportive of interracial relationships.
you two ever had trouble because of that before?
sometimes.
the way people looked at us. The things they would say.
is that why you didn't tell Wesley's parents about the two of you?
I wanted to.
I mean, I met them, and I liked them, but he was worried. You know, he thought they might not react that well.
um, did wesley or any of his friends ever mention anything about gangs?
Wesley mostly stayed away from people that were into that.
can you remember any details about the shooting?
we were just driving along and I heard this guy yelling from the next car.
he was swearing, and, uh, Wesley slowed down to try to let him pass, and then,
I heard him scream, this is from everyone.
and then, I don't know, I guess he just started shooting.
it was so loud, and...
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Oh, sweetie.
the guy yelled, this is from everyone.
I mean, you think this whole thing is some sort of racist political statement?
the official legal term is "hate crime."
what if she heard him wrong? - What do you mean?
maybe he didn't yell, "from everyone."
there's over 200 gangs in L. A. There's 35 in this area alone.
what if he yelled, from 4-1, or from 8-1.
you see, a gangster will yell out his territory before he pulls the trigger, so that you know who's sending bullets your way. If we're looking at a feud between the 6-deuces and the 5-treys, well, what if the shooter was from a different gang?
any recent incidents in these other gang territories?
two weeks ago, we got a shots fired report on two kids, 14 years old, a couple of 8-1s.
someone shot at them from a moving black suv.
lieutenant tao, would you please get me a full incident report of that shooting and anything else about the 8-1s and then,
I'd like to take a look around that neighborhood and see if anyone will talk to me.
6-deuces, 8-1s, eleventy-4s.
how can they keep straight who's shooting at who?
well, lieutenant provenza, maybe they can't.
30pm on the 10th, two 14-year-old boys were leaving this apartment here when a black suv screeches around this corner and opens fire.
one kid got lucky, the other one, not so much.
he's paralyzed from the waist down.
witnesses reported between 10 and 15 rounds were fired.
what else did the witnesses report?
one guy swore the SUV was dark blue, but everybody else said black.
there was a girl who was pretty sure it was a navigator.
one of the kid's cousins gave chase for a few blocks, but gave up when he realized his little cousin was on the ground.
Hey. Don't touch that.
the guy that gave chase, did the report list his given name or a nickname?
given.
I got a feeling Wesley's shooters are a couple of gangsters named Pookie and Little Devil.
why do you say that?
cause they signed their confession right here on the wall.
187. That's murder.
B, crossed out.
that means dead bloods.
5-3 with a slash through it.
that indicates a specific territory.
USC, slash through it.
that's our victim.
names above it, Pookie and Little Devil, those are our shooters.
they're telling the world how they got revenge on the 5-3 for shooting at their 8-1 brothers.
Pookie has a pretty long record.
selling drugs. Assault.
a bunch of misdemeanors.
but he's pretty high up in the 8-1 organization.
is this in focus?
Oh, buzz, bless you.
Pookie tell us anything?
we got a better shot at Little Devil.
he'd be afraid to let his brothers down.
but he hasn't done any time yet.
anyone have a quarter?
Yeah, why?
can I borrow it for a minute, please?
thank you.
which one of you is Lawrence?
then, you must be Michael.
OK, boys.
here's the situation.
we know that the two of you murdered two people and wounded a third two days ago.
we know this because you basically signed your confession on the wall of your cousin's apartment building in spray paint.
not smart, but probably not enough to get a conviction, so I need one of you to talk.
one driver, one shooter, one deal.
all you have to do is tell me you were driving.
OK. I understand.
it could be a bit awkward.
selling out your friend to his face, so...
call it in the air.
heads.
it's tails.
detective Sanchez, will you please escort Lawrence here to interview room two.
thank you.
let's go.
well, Michael.
looks like Pookie's gonna get the first chance.
you better hope he's stubborn.
and stupid.
we've been in here half an hour.
ain't you gonna ask me anything?
well, you're not gonna tell me anything, are you, Pookie?
no.
Okey dokey.
well, Michael, should've called tails.
what did he say?
Oh, I can't tell you that.
but it looks like I'll be getting off work a little early today.
come on, man.
don't I get a chance?
no, Michael.
I'm sorry. Because I know what you're going to say.
you're gonna tell me the same story Pookie told me.
only this time, you're gonna be the one who's behind the wheel.
but that's what happened.
what? What happened?
I was driving.
see, Michael.
this is exactly what I'm saying.
but I was.
you never fired a gun into that suv?
no.
then who did?
I'll call the Talmadges.
and why did Pookie fire 40 rounds into Wesley Talmadge's escalade?
payback.
that's the same escalade that opened up on Pookie's cousin 2 weeks ago.
the shooting on 81st street?
an eye witness reported a black navigator.
Pookie shot the wrong car.
no. It wasn't no wrong car.
after them dudes shot his cousin, Pookie chased after them.
he knew what that escalade looked like.
do you know how many black escalades there are in L. A?
I know cars.
I'm saying it was that escalade.
I know rims.
and the sticker on the back.
what sticker?
the usc sticker on the back window.
I realize the odds are a little bit longer, but this is L. A.
I mean, there could've been another escalade with an 'sc sticker on it.
lieutenant tao, how thorough was the lab?
they were a little backed up down here.
they haven't gotten to it yet.
and I don't imagine it's gonna be a top priority now that we found the shooter.
well, we may know that Pookie shot Wesley, but I'm still not convinced we know why.
what are you looking for?
a casing.
the tech-9 casing ejects sideways.
a couple inches forward at most.
casings not gonna fly all the way from the shooter's gun into here.
I don't care about bullets fired at this car.
I want to know about bullets fired... from this car.
and what reason do we have to believe you didn't plant this casing?
excuse me?
Ron, that's not fair.
you people do it all the time.
you need to close your case.
blame it on the black kid.
come on. We're leaving.
Hey, hey. Settle down, Mr. Talmadge, ok?
I know this is hard news to hear but it's hard news to deliver, too so maybe we could all just
our son was murdered, and you're saying this is hard for you?
Lynn, come on.
Ron, listen.
I'll make sure none of these details get out.
none of this matters anyway.
what matters is we got the punks who
wait, wait, wait.
what night did you say the other shooting took place?
the 10th.
Wesley couldn't have done this.
we had the Escalade that night.
we did.
I think we went out to dinner that night.
Yeah. A restaurant called "shay."
on the 10th at 8 o'clock.
how could Wesley have shot those kids if we had the Escalade on the other side of town?
don't bother.
they don't believe us.
they think we're lying to protect our son.
I think that you've been through a terrible experience.
and it's our word against yours.
it's your word against physical evidence.
come on. We're leaving.
wait.
come on!
I will not have my son turned into some gangster punk.
I can't believe my daughter's done with work in time for dinner.
so is this place any good?
supposed to be.
Talmadges came here a couple weeks ago.
who are the Talmadges?
friends of a friend.
Oh, it really is nice of you to pull away from work for an evening.
I'm just gonna check their story.
I'll do it when I go to the bathroom.
it won't get in the way of dinner.
I promise.
thank you.
thank you so much.
thank you.
thank you so much.
now don't put that in there, you'll never find it again.
Oh, for heaven's sake.
liability is not assumed by management "for loss or damage due to fire, theft, or any other cause."
mama, can't we just have a nice dinner?
Oh, I just don't understand why people in LOS angeles don't want to park their own car.
excuse me.
excuse me, sir.
I need to ask you a few questions.
were you working here 2 weeks ago?
no. I just started last tuesday.
Oh.
cuffs!
get off me, man.
get off me, man.
you gave us a run for our money, marcus at the restaurant.
you ever been in a gang?
no, ma'am.
that's pretty amazing.
growing up where you did.
it's hard to steer clear of that life.
Yeah.
my dad, he couldn't.
got shot. Died.
my ma didn't want that for me.
she wanted me to finish school get a job. So that's what I did.
good for her.
good for you.
she must be so proud of you.
Yes, ma'am.
you ever been arrested?
Yeah.
a few years ago. Stupid stuff though.
I mean, like breaking the windows.
shoplifting. I paid for everything.
you ever stolen a car?
no, ma'am. Never.
because there was a shooting.
a double homicide involving a stolen car and we have reason to believe you had something to do with it.
what are you talking about?
what shooting?
a couple of days ago. A few kids.
Wesley Talmadge and Myra Singleton.
shot dead.
I never seen these people.
I swear, I don't know who they are.
who they were, Marcus.
why did you run from me at the restaurant?
well, where I'm from, you see a badge, you don't stick around.
you recognize these people?
no, Ma'am.
they didn't eat at your restaurant?
a couple weeks ago?
they were driving a black Escalade.
I don't know.
a lot of people
a lot of people come down to the restaurant. Maybe they did.
you know they did.
you parked their car for them.
or rather, you didn't.
not right away anyway.
now do you want to tell me what happened, or do you want me to tell you?
you took the keys from Ronald Talmadge but instead of parking that car, you drove down to 81st street looking to settle a score.
you saw two 8-1s, and you shot at them.
paralyzing one of the boys from the waist down, and then, you drove back to the restaurant, and you parked that Escalade.
no, Ma'am.
you figured they'd never know their car was missing.
and the 8-1s couldn't identify you since you were driving a stolen car.
but something else happened, when you shot at those 8-1s. Marcus those bullets kept on going.
they kept on going until they killed Wesley and Myra.
what do these kids have to do with the others you showed me?
after you shot at those children, the 8-1s retaliated.
someone saw that Escalade you were driving.
an 8-1 named Pookie.
Pookie hunted for that Escalade.
and when he found it, he shot at it. 40 times.
Wesley Talmadge was 19.
he was driving his parents' car.
he wasn't in a gang.
and neither was Myra.
and now they're both dead.
I was there when Wesley's mother found out that her son, who she loved more than anything, was dead.
all because of what you did on the 10th, Marcus.
those bullets kept on going.
no, Ma'am.
no. I didn't do this thing.
I did not.
but you were there.
you were driving the Talmadge's car.
people saw that Escalade.
ma'am it was those kids.
it was those 8-1 babies.
they pushed me at the movies a couple weeks ago.
they pushed you?
I didn't want to make nothing of it but my friend was there, and he said they was dissin' me.
what friend, Marcus?
first you lie to me about stealing a car and now you're covering up for one of your gangster friends.
how am I supposed to belive you're not in a gang?
how's your mother supposed to believe that?
ma'am, you can say you ain't gonna be in no gang but that don't make the gangs go away.
you still got to walk to school.
you still got to the store.
what was I supposed to do?
so you stayed friendly with those gang members?
you got to!
I don't want anything bad to happen to you.
I think you're a good person.
but if you don't tell me who did this...
all the evidence points to you.
I didn't...kill anybody.
I didn't even know he was gonna do it.
he stopped by where I work, and we was just hangin'out talkin'.
and when I go to park that Escalade he hops in and tells me to drive.
I should've said no, I know but he was ridin' me.
sayin' that me being weak makes him look weak, you know what I'm sayin'?
and he had a gun, and he was yellin'.
turn here, turn there.
next thing I know, we're on 81st street.
he was only supposed to scare'em.
but then he pulls out his piece and starts shooting.
and I just drove us out of there fast as I could.
I swear.
that's the truth.
I was only driving.
I didn't kill nobody, and I ain't in no gang.
Marcus, you drove a stolen car to take a gang member and his semi-automatic weapon into rival territory to scare some kids?
now if that ain't gang activity I don't know what is.
if you're in this gang, ok.
maybe going to jail will get you some respect, but if you're not, don't ruin it by covering up for this guy.
that's what gang members do for each other.
tell me his name!
I'm gonna die for this.
I'm gonna die now.
I won't let them kill you.
you can't stop it, Ma'am.
but I'll give you the name.
cause of that other little boy and that other girl.
his name is...big junior.
what's big junior's real name, Marcus?
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I tried so hard to make it through.
we have a name.
I tried so hard.
tell my mom that.
you can tell her yourself.
write it all down.
if I understand,
I know she will.
he's all yours.
commander.
we need to find this big junior guy.
we might not be able to get him for murder, but we can probably get him for attempted murder.
assault with a deadly weapon.
shooting in an inhabited building.
a guy like this probably has a record.
maybe we can give him his third strike.
we're already on it.
and talk to the D. A.
I want to make sure that Marcus gets protection in exchange for his testimony.
that protection should begin tonight commander.
Yes, Ma'am.
you know, a non-fatal gang-related shooting on 81st street isn't usually considered the jurisdiction of priority homicide.
seems less like you're doing your job and more like you're doing a favor.
I'm not doing anyone any favors.
just...
can I just say thank you?
for what?
Wesley's still dead.
you saved his reputation.
a lot good that does him now.
Yeah. Maybe so.
but that's all his parents have left.
mama, I'm so sorry about dinner and all.
Oh, honey, it's fine.
besides, I'm getting up early.
I'm flying out in the morning.
what?
you moved your flight up. Why?
I thought you were staying longer.
I promised to show you stars that aren't dead.
guests are like fish.
after 3 days, you better throw them out.
you've been here a week.
Mrs. Johnson.
really. Stay.
that's sweet.
but I best get on home.
your daddy's probably run out of fresh underwear.
besides, this gives Fritz a chance to move his stuff in from that tacky u-haul.
in fact, why don't you go out now and get yourself a clean pair of pants.
thank you, Willie Ray.
I think I will.
how--how
half the medicine cabinet was empty.
half your closet.
his mail was arriving here.
I never could get a straight answer as to where he lived.
and that baseball pyramid on your table.
why did you think you had to keep this a secret from me?
I didn't want to disappoint you.
it's much too late for that.
are you gonna tell daddy about this?
Oh, lord, no.
testing. 1,2, 3.Testing.
sergeant Gabriel.
if you could just state your name and describe what you witnessed.
I'm officer solis, lapd, hollywood division.
we responded here to a possible 187, did a visual check of the house, saw what we thought was a body on the downstairs floor.
finding all doors and windows locked from the inside, we waited for backup.
then we did a hot-crisis entry. - Great.
and now she wants the number of the 911 caller.
I'm detective Sergeant David Gabriel, priority homicide, lapd.
we arrived on the scene, called out for the coroner, and obtained a search warrant.
so far we've found almost $800 in cash and lots of jewelry, so although we cannot rule out a robbery, we are yet to determine what might have been stolen.
over here, we have victim number one.
not yet. Not yet.
hold on. Hold on.
ready? - Detective Julio Sanchez, priority homicide.
according to the victim's driver's license, her name is Marsha Anderson Wallace, 42.
deputy chief brenda Leigh Johnson, priority homicide division.
for the record, Mrs. Wallace has multiple stab wounds on her body and defensive wounds to her hands.
could you document that, please?
here and here.
over here, what could be a blood trail, where Mrs. Wallace possibly struggled with her attacker or attackers.
okay. Next body.
I am detective Daniels, priority homicide division.
according to his driver's license, the victim's name is Kevin Alan Wallace, 49.
Mr. Wallace appears to have been attacked while standing by his desk.
and, um, I've counted over 30 stab wounds in the body.
the room, please.
and I want y'all to go through the house collecting laptops, computers, and cellphones, please.
and, Buzz, when you're finished in here, why don't you meet me by the stairs next to the last body, please? Thank you.
Yes, Ma'am.
lieutenant Andrew Flynn, phd.
we're assuming this victim, Jennifer Anne Wallace, who, um...signs her homework "Jenny" -- and just, uh...
just, uh -- you know what? Wait. Just wait.
lieutenant Flynn, you okay?
are you? I mean, look at this. Look.
all this came from this little girl's heart, and I can't say that it's blood?
just one second, okay?
sergeant Gabriel, I know I asked you this before, but could you please find the patrol officer and get the phone number of whoever reported these deaths to 911
and start calling it, please, to see if anyone answers? Thank you.
uh, one in Mrs. Wallace's purse and one off and charging behind the wet bar in the den.
you want me to look in the little girl's room? - Yes, please. Thank you.
thank you.
look, Lieutenant, I know that this is hard,
but we are filming this crime scene for the court
if you call one little spot "blood" that isn't blood
and I can't edit this, so...
okay.
the victim is 12 and in her pajamas.
so maybe she came downstairs to see what all the screaming was about.
there are three visible wounds -- one in the back, one in the chest, and one in the throat.
would you document please - Yes, Ma'am.
there's a letter opener here in the sink.
now, this might be from the blotter set on the desk downstairs.
now, over here - - you have to identify yourself for the court.
Oh, for crying out -- Lieutenant Provenza, priority homicide.
now, record all this here, too.
you can see what might be blood all over the floor.
we think that whoever killed the Wallaces came up here and took a shower after.
Hello, there.
I'm Lieutenant Michael Tao, priority homicide division of the los angeles police.
now, if you'll come with me.
I found these clothes in the washer.
they have a red substance on them, perhaps blood.
um, this way.
it's also worth noting that the victims' 17-year-old son, Eric Dean Wallace, is not home at 4: 33 A. M.
and his room has not been touched, despite having a lot of high-end merchandise lying around.
Oh, and the shoes from the washer are the same size as the shoes on this floor, right here.
buzz, downstairs. - Out.
backup. Now.
get down on your stomach!
please. Please. Please. Please.
get up.
what's your name?
I'm Eric Dean Wallace.
I want to see my mom and dad.
I want to see them, please. - I understand that, honey.
that's just not a good idea right now, okay?
can you tell me when all this happened?
I woke up, and I was going downstairs to get a drink of water.
and...I got to the stairs.
Jenny -- she was just lying there.
was there anyone visiting your house this evening?
no.
did you hear a doorbell or a knock or - - no.
do you know anyone who might want to hurt your family?
my dad works with some convicts.
he works for the federal prison up terminal island and the one up at lompoc, too.
he's -- he's a sociologist.
okay.
okay, sweetheart.
okay, now.
all right, then.
they're gonna treat you for shock, okay?
they're gonna take good care of you, okay?
all right. Bless your heart.
okay.
sergeant Gabriel here is gonna ride with you to the hospital.
I'll go with him, chief. - No, you won't, lieutenant.
all right, Detective Sanchez, that boy had pupils the size of saucers.
I'd like you to get a warrant so we can check his blood for drugs when he gets to the hospital, please.
and, Lieutenant Flynn, since you seem to be in the mood,
I'd like you to get the patrol officers who said this house was cleared.
give them a piece of my mind, okay?
you got it. - Thank you.
lieutenant Provenza...
please supervise the search warrant.
the killer was looking for something. Maybe he didn't find it.
thank you.
Hey, don't forget you have a meeting with chief Pope at 10: 00 A. M.
Oh, for heaven sakes.
do you have any idea what that's all about?
shoot!
and no more overtime.
how can there be no overtime?
what if my victims don't die between 8: 00 and 4: 00 in the afternoon?
look, it's just a little approval process we're implementing during this time of financial crisis, which was created by the state of California, not by me.
is that why my request for expedited blood work was denied?
what blood work?
I have a boy in the hospital, Eric Wallace, and early this morning, his entire family was found stabbed to death in their house, and the boy, up in the attic, high as a kite.
so you obtain a search warrant and draw the boy's blood.
we did that, Will.
and now Detective Sanchez tells me
because it would cost an extra dollar or something
that my request to test the boy's blood for intoxicants was denied.
it's not denied. It's delayed.
you'll have the results tomorrow morning.
tomorrow, that boy can have an attorney appointed for him by children's services.
I need that blood work, and I need it right now.
consider just for a moment a universe in which you work for me and what I need is important, too.
I'll do that after you consider getting out of bed at 3: 00 in the morning and examining a 12-year-old girl who's been stabbed through the heart.
what about her needs, Will? What about that?
look, I know this is hard, but so is losing 6% of our budget and simultaneously beefing up our counterterrorism bureau.
it's not just, uh, halting expedited blood work.
every section has to lose at least one detective.
you don't mean mine.
Yes, I do mean yours, Brenda. Every section.
who would I let go?
come on. You know as well as I do.
no.
six months ago, Provenza left his gun in his desk drawer.
lieutenant Provenza was cleared of all - - no, he was not cleared.
Hey, we have all left our guns.
yours is in your drawer right now.
okay?
listen, I can't find the savings I need, except by losing and/or transferring personnel.
you must -- must -- send someone from your team to counterterrorism or talk Provenza into retiring.
which is the better solution? It's obvious.
what do I have to do to make you agree with me?
stop being wrong.
look, I'll pay for the expedited blood work myself, but my team stays put.
no, Brenda, no deal.
I'll find the savings some other way.
Yeah, good luck with that. - Thank you.
the only other thing I found at the house, other than eric's drug stash here, was that the garage door was open and the Wallaces' vehicle had been broken into.
okay.
so, the killer was looking for something specific.
it may have belonged to Mr.Wallace, but we don't know what it was.
um, Lieutenant Tao, how are we doing with our murder weapon?
Oh, um...
wiped clean. No prints.
preliminary time of death for all victims between 11: 00 and 12: 45.
and I sent the bloody clothes from the washing machine to the lab for testing.
detective Daniels, cellphones, laptops?
all accounted for. - Okay.
lieutenant Flynn?
you really want background on this family? Why?
the weapon came from inside.
every door was bolted. Every window was locked.
okay, so maybe the murders weren't premeditated.
but the son did it. We all know that the son did it.
and Eric lied about his father, too.
Wallace didn't work at either the Federal prison on terminal island, nor up in Lompoc.
why would Eric lie about where his father worked?
the kid was on "X.
Oh, and you owe me $150 for this expedited blood work.
Eric is sedated.
but this, uh, bitch-y
E. R.Nurse got all whacked out over Eric maybe being a killer and how the hospital is not a detention center.
so now they won't hold him after he comes to.
I mean, you got maybe five hours.
this is your receipt.
okay, five hours.
um, okay, um...
lieutenant Tao, if you could please get phone dumps for the Wallaces' cellphones and landlines.
thank you.
and, Lieutenant Flynn, if you could take our murder weapon over to the morgue and have Dr. Crippen match it against the wounds.
detective Daniels, follow up on that terminal island and Lompoc connection, please.
if Mr. Wallace didn't work there, he might be on the prisons' visitors lists.
okay, Lieutenant Provenza, if you could please gather everyone's reports and bring them over to me at the hospital. Thank you.
Oh, and, uh, since it's saturday, um, if y'all could sign out when you leave, um, starting with Detective Sanchez, 'cause we have to pinch those pennies where we can.
thank you. Thanks.
what in the hell is wrong with you?
do you not understand budget cuts?
what budget cuts? - The memo's on your desk.
every department's losing a detective.
and Flynn's acting like he wants to be the short straw.
I'm not the one eligible for retirement here.
well, let's -- let's get on with it.
time is money, folks.
time is money.
Hey.
are you coming to look at these open houses...
or not?
I know that the prisons are federal property but they should at least let us look at their visitors lists.
uh, well, all right, detective, maybe I can get the FBI to hurry those lists along for us.
all right, then. Thank you. Bye.
so, I have this murder suspect...
telling me that his father works at the Federal prisons at terminal island and up at Lompoc.
but both prisons say they never heard of the father at all.
looks bad for the son.
and in order to examine the prisons' visitors lists, we have to put together individual warrants.
however, if a very special agent of the FBI were to call and ask
no problem.
all you have to do is fill out these forms requesting our assistance, and I can hand it in to our office on monday.
couldn't you just call and that was on my desk all day friday.
Yeah, people kept stopping by, bursting out laughing.
isn't that hilarious?
this thing is just -- it's awful.
but what happened at my work today?
Pope announced cutbacks, including, like, in personnel.
and he took away our overtime.
well, that's nuts. What if people get murdered at night?
exactly.
and all this paperwork, honey, it will take hours to fill out.
Yeah, you're right.
so, are you coming with me today or not?
Oh, I-I have to put that off at least until tomorrow, because
Hey! Hey! What a minute.
you are being completely unfair about this.
I have a murder to investigate.
you always have a murder.
and, you know, I like this house. It's comfortable.
it's done. You are always rushing me.
how many times do I have to win this argument?
there is no place for my stuff here or to set up an office or to have overnight guests, like our parents.
well, we can't have my father come here anyway.
we haven't figured out a way to explain that you've moved in.
Yeah, well, I haven't moved in, now, have I?
almost everything I own is still in the garage!
now, do you want the visitors lists to the prisons at Lompoc and terminal island or not?
are you telling me that you're refusing to help me with my murder investigation because I can't go house hunting with you today?
Yeah, good. I don't have to explain it to you.
well, I refuse to stand here and haggle with you, as if we're trading trinkets in some bazaar.
good. If I see something I like, I'll take pictures.
because Mr.Wallace was an orphan.
how can people be orphans?
she's mad because Eric's father had no parents.
his mother was an only child, parents deceased, so we have no relative to release the kid to.
considering how the kid treats his next of kin, it's probably best.
I have some -- chief, chief, please.
please. Here. Let me.
anyway, unless Eric turns out to be suicidal, which is highly unlikely based upon the way he just ate, the hospital says we either have to arrest him, or they're gonna release him to child protective services, which takes him out of our custody.
I don't have enough evidence yet to book him for murder.
well, we have him on drug possession.
no. Arrest, lawyer, the end.
so I need a suicide watch or a confession.
I know Mr.Wallace didn't work in prisons.
I can't find anything here about how he made his income.
no, it's all small amounts from articles he published in academic journals.
here you go, chief.
Mrs. Wallace was the one with the money.
here, listen to this.
she, uh, pulled in $900, 000 a year on her mutual funds, tax-free.
Plus, she had dividends off $30 million worth of oil stock.
now, this is a tough one.
guess who the Wallaces' beneficiaries are.
their children.
recently reduced to one.
thank you, lieutenant.
you can take the rest of the night off.
well, I-I signed out when I left the office.
you know, I've never been a clock watcher.
that's enough for now.
Thanks.
so, wish me luck.
budget cuts.
Thanks, guys.
in fact, Pope says if I can't find some way to save money, I'll
if you can't find some way to save money, what?
lieutenant Provenza may have to retire.
testing. 1, 2,3. Testing.
testing. 1, 2,3. Testing.
I woke up.
my throat was really dry, so I started to go downstairs to get some water.
and you saw your sister's body?
Yes, I found my little sister, Jenny.
okay.
so you walked out of your room.
and I yelled for my parents.
and no one answered, so I ran up to my room and called 911, then I climbed into the attic.
did you hear the police arrive?
there were no sirens or anything.
I heard noises later.
I didn't know who it was.
I couldn't move.
and you have no idea how the killer or killers entered? - No.
what they might have been looking for? - No.
or what time this all happened?
I guess I must have just slept through it.
see, Eric, I just -- I find that so hard to believe.
Why?
I'll show you.
outside!
outside now!
No!
stop. Stop.
that is the mixture of sounds that the human body makes when someone shoves a knife in it.
that's the sound that your parents made when they were being stabbed to death.
that's the sound that Jenny heard that made her race downstairs, just like everyone rushed in here right now.
that's the sound that Jenny made until the killer stabbed her in the throat 10 feet from the door of your room, which is why I find it so hard to believe that you slept through it all, especially since
especially since you were high on mdma, also known as ecstasy, which is the drug hospital tests confirmed were in your bloodstream last night.
x" is kind of speedy.
it keeps you awake.
so, Eric, when I find a high teenage boy in the attic of his house and his entire family's been stabbed to death downstairs and that boy lies to be about, well, everything, I think,"maybe I should just arrest him for murder and call it a day.
no, but I didn't do it.
okay, I wouldn't have. I couldn't do it.
all right, then, let's start over again, and you can tell me the truth this time.
were you on drugs last night?
Yes, I was high, okay, but I wasn't home.
where were you, then?
I snuck out.
there's a ladder in the attic that I use to get downstairs without my parents knowing.
wait a minute -- are you telling me you left a window to your bedroom unlocked and a ladder leaning against the house?
no.
no, okay?
I lay the ladder down where it can't be seen, and I pull it back up in the attic when I get home.
it's what I always do.
it's what you always do?
how long have you been sneaking out?
just the last two months.
and who are you sneaking out to see, high on ecstasy?
I need a name now.
Eric Dean Wallace, you are under arrest
no, just wait! Just wait!
who picks you up?
okay. Justin Darcy.
Justin picks me up.
who is Justin Darcy?
he's my math tutor.
why does justin pick you up?
cause we went to a club...
dancing, and then we went back to his apartment.
to study math on "x"?
did your father find out you were sneaking out and who you were with?
is that what happened, Eric?
was your dad waiting up for you?
did you two fight? - No.
okay? No, they never knew. Just please
did Justin know that the window to your bedroom was unlocked?
did he go back?
no, I was with him the whole time.
where did your father work?
I told you. He works for the prison.
we have contacted both those prisons, and neither of them have ever heard of your father.
no.
no, no, but he works there.
ask Dr. Reichter.
who's Dr. Reichter?
he's a psychologist. He works with prisoners, okay?
him and my dad, they write articles together.
ask Dr. Reichter.
okay, let's call him right now.
what's his number?
I don't know. I don't have it.
I just heard his name said a lot.
I'm telling the truth, okay?
I swear it.
you swear it?!
well, you're such an honest young man.
why would anyone doubt you?
I'm sorry, okay?
I'm sorry.
you're sorry?
you've already admitted to leaving your house unsecured.
that makes you partially responsible for the murder of your family, even if you didn't kill them yourself.
you lied to me about where you were during the time of the murder, and the best you can manage is,"I'm sorry"?
well, what do you want me to say?!
do you think "I'm sorry" will bring your mother back? - What can I say to change
you can't change things now! - No! No! No!
I wish I was dead! Okay?!
does that help?! I wish I was dead.
I wish whoever killed my family killed me!
okay, I wish I was dead!
those are the magic words.
suicide watch.
72 hours surveillance.
first thing tomorrow, I want to interview this Justin Darcy.
I want that ladder checked for prints.
and I want to talk to Dr. Reichter.
Yeah, well, tomorrow is sunday. There's no overtime.
it can't be helped.
I'll lead the doctor in to see him.
I'm sorry, mom.
I'm sorry, mom.
I'm sorry, Jenny.
so in several of his articles about prison life, Mr. Wallace quotes a Dr. Robert reichter.
and so I called the prisons at terminal island and Lompoc, and Reichter's a psychologist at both facilities.
lives in Lompoc, but he's off this weekend.
well, can't we call him?
wouldn't they give you his home number?
not over the phone.
he's a federal prison employee.
I couldn't even get his driver's license on a search.
all right, Um, what about the letter at the Wallaces' house?
Oh, I got three sets of prints.
one's eric's.
one's his father's.
one we couldn't identify.
ran it through afis -- no hit.
it could have been a gardener or something.
or it could be our friend Justin Darcy.
he's in the interview room right now with Flynn and Sanchez.
so Wallace didn't work at the prisons themselves, but maybe he did work with the prison employees?
thank you, doctor.
okay, so, the suicide watch from last night is official, and the doctor says he can keep Eric sedated unless you want to talk to him.
suicide watch?
Hi, everybody.
Eric Wallace said he wished he was dead.
do you want me to hold a suicidal teenager here, Will?
I want you to arrest the kid, put him in the custody of the sheriff's department and let them pay for the suicide watch.
if I arrest him, Will, he'll get an attorney.
or don't you want me to get a confession?
you have a strong circumstantial case.
but I still have a lot of questions, like why does Eric insist that his father works at prisons?
why were the rooms in the house tossed, but nothing seems to be stolen?
and what about the clothes in the washer?
and there's a prison psychologist, and the Feds won't give me his number, and I need to talk to him in the worst way.
do you have a motive?
Mr. Wallace may have discovered his son was slipping out to meet a boyfriend.
arguments about stuff like that have a way of escalating.
and Eric was to inherit millions of dollars.
so, motive, means, opportunity, suspect.
is it really necessary to call in everyone on earth on sunday to tie up the loose ends?
I don't have everyone on earth here.
I have no civilian assistants at all.
Hey, chief -- sorry.
um, Lieutenant Flynn wanted me to tell you that he just mirandized the Justin Darcy guy on tape.
okay. Thank you, Buzz.
I'll be there in a minute.
you're welcome.
Really? No civilians at all?
you know, look, if you are this worried about money, you know what is really cheap?
not solving the crime.
what are you doing here, anyway?
don't you spend sunday with your kids?
they're with their mother.
estelle takes them to theme parks.
I get to turn off the television, make them eat their vegetables, and put them to bed.
guess who they prefer spending time with.
what all that means is that I already understand how hard it is to split up a family.
and since you don't seem to be taking me seriously, let me remind you that tomorrow I need the name of the detective you're releasing from this squad.
no. No, no.
I'm actively looking for the money we need to save.
Yeah, but you're actively searching for it at time and a half.
look, here's the solution.
Provenza retires, or you send someone to counterterrorism tomorrow.
good morning, Mr. Darcy.
I'm deputy chief Brenda Leigh Johnson, lapd, and I have brought you in this morning to talk about rape.
I haven't raped anyone ever.
I have a statement alleging sexual assault from your victim.
do you know how stupid that is?
I think I should get my one phone call and talk to my dad.
he's a criminal attorney, okay?
so I think I know a bit more about the justice system than the average person you drag in here.
lieutenant Flynn, would you please hand Mr. Darcy your phone?
as I'm sure you're aware, Mr. Darcy, given your vast knowledge of the law, that the age of consent for male-male sex in the state of california is 18.
I'm 19 in 2 months.
many happy returns.
Eric Wallace, the boy whom you are currently tutoring, is 17.
make sure to tell your father that the charges against you will include but will not necessarily be limited to statutory rape and sex with a minor.
I look forward to meeting your family.
I can only imagine how proud they'll be.
Hey, I'll dial your dad.
what's the number?
wait.
okay. Wait.
no, I never had sex with Eric.
if that's true, we'll be arresting your underage boyfriend for the murder of his family.
what?
the night before last, Eric's parents and his sister were found stabbed to death in their home.
what?
Eric gave a statement saying that he was with you during the time of the murder, dancing and carrying on, and I don't know what all.
so who's the liar -- you or Eric?
so what you're saying is either I'm a sex offender...
I think I found what the murderer was looking for...
or Eric's a killer?
maybe you picked Eric up, dropped him off at your place, went back, and murdered his parents yourself.
you knew there was a window open.
no. Wait. Wait.
no. Okay.
Yes, I picked him up friday night.
Yes, okay?
but -- but if his parents died before 3: 00 in the morning, he didn't do it, and neither did I.
do you have someone that can back up that story?
Yeah.
Yeah, we met up with some friends when we went out dancing.
write it all down -- everywhere you went, everyone you saw --name, numbers, times.
excuse me.
explain, please.
the Wallaces' carrier said they had four cellphones.
Daniels found this one charging behind the wet bar in the den of their house.
we thought it was one of the four in the plan.
it turns out it isn't.
whose is it, then?
well, it belongs to, uh, Dr. Robert reichter.
are you telling me that the Wallaces had reichter's phone in their den and we're just finding out about this now?
I ordered the phone dumps last night.
they couldn't get it back to us till today, so I signed out, liked you asked, and I just started downloading cells a minute ago.
you don't believe this little prick's story, do you?
please sit with Mr. Darcy until I'm ready to speak with him again.
impossible!
so, were there any calls from Dr. Reichter's cell I should know about?
Yes, Ma'am, Dr. Reichter was calling Eric wallace on a fairly regular basis.
not the father?
no, Ma'am, he was calling the son.
Eric Wallace told me he'd never spoken to Dr. Reichter, that...
he had only heard the name.
okay, just...
just give me a second here.
these bad lies are confusing me.
we found four cellphones at the Wallaces' house.
Dr. Reichter's was one of the four phones we found.
so whose phone's missing?
Mr. Wallace's, but we have the dump off of his number.
were there any calls made on Dr. Wallace's phone since his death?
at around 1: 00 A. M. Saturday morning, someone made 15 calls in a row from Mr. Wallace's cellphone to the phone you're holding in your hand.
okay, so the killer grabbed Mr. Wallace's cellphone and started walking around with it, and calling Dr. Reichter's cell.
hoping Reichter's cell would ring, but Reichter's phone was off.
charging behind the wet bar in the den, maybe like it was hidden.
so the phone I'm holding in my hand -- Dr. Reichter's phone
this is what the killer was looking for.
okay.
there are -- there are no pictures in here, only...
six...
programmed numbers.
now, why would this phone be worth hiding, and why was Dr. Reichter's phone at the Wallaces' house in the first place?
that's the really important question, and we would have known to ask it yesterday if it weren't for all this malarkey about budget cuts.
now I really need to see those visitors lists from terminal island and lompoc.
chief, I know you're not gonna want to hear this, but the guy who could help cut through some of this red tape
I know. I know. I just -- I know.
let's look for this guy Wallace through about, uh, six months back.
Oh. Oh, you're Dr. Reichter's parents.
both prisons would be great.
goodness, I don't know how I could have mixed that up. - thank you
unless he's visiting you.
I owe you a dinner.
Oh. Oh, he's in L. A.
for the week.
right.
okay.
well, I-I'm sorry about that.
thank you so much for your help.
all right. Thank you. Bye.
okay, so that's Dr. Reichter's wife, sister, son, and parents all telling me that he's in L. A.
at the same quality inn by the harbor.
the black-and-whites I sent there say Reichter never checked out, at least not under his own name.
Daniels Dragged his credit cards, and Dr. Reichter stopped using them.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
it's okay.
well, if there's anyone who knows how to manage their money so as not to get caught by the police, it would be a prison shrink.
the first thing they hear from convicts after "I'm innocent" is how everyone got caught.
Reichter's probably been told how to stay off the grid, how to establish an alias, how to get overseas with lots of cash.
have you decided how you're reconfiguring your squad?
because I think I have an idea that might be of help.
Hello, Mr. Taylor? - I'm here. I'm here.
Wallace never visited either facility?
well, uh...thanks for looking.
back at you.
so Eric just fabricated his father's work life?
why don't you give me Gabriel?
excuse me?
and I'll handle all further transfers and retirements that we need to make our budget work from the departments that report to me.
I'll even share Gabriel with you on the big cases when you need him.
so you're suggesting that Gabriel spend part of his time with you and...
part of his time with me?
it's in the kid's best interest, chief.
you already have three lieutenants.
what chance does Gabriel have for a promotion working for you?
I'll, uh -- I'll discuss it with him on my way up to Lompoc.
you're going to Lompoc now?
I am, and, uh...
I appreciate the suggestion, commander.
thank you.
thank you very much.
happy to help, chief.
no, thank you.
thank you, sir.
okay, Lompoc police found a friendly judge, and your warrant will be ready when we arrive.
okay, thank you.
uh...so, sergeant, there's this other thing.
commander Taylor suggested that you might want to go back to work for him.
he thinks it might improve your chances of promotion.
in return, he would absorb all future budget cuts.
and I promised I'd mention it to you.
Is...that...what you want me to do?
you want me to go back and work for taylor?
hardly.
but, um, if you think it's in your own long-term best interest
well, I mean, I don't know that lapd is gonna be my whole career.
in fact, I was thinking maybe about going into politics.
you're kidding.
well, I have a law-enforcement background, a master's in public administration.
Hey, this, uh -- this isn't the way to Lompoc.
no, we're going to the airport.
we're taking the lapd plane?
I thought you were supposed to be saving money.
no, sergeant, we are supposed to be finding a murderer, and we are not doing it in the car-pool lane.
city of Lompoc Police
thanks for the escort from the airport, captain.
our pleasure.
we train for this kind of thing a lot, but we don't get to do it as much as you guys.
you wouldn't know it. Everyone here looks very sharp.
Thanks, son.
we'll just fax that bill down to...
chief will Pope. I'll give you the number when we're done here.
think Dr. Reichter's here?
no, sergeant, Dr. Reichter's dead.
yes -- oh, my god.
are you Miss Kathy Reichter?
Yes. What's going on here?
is there something wrong with robert?
we're here to serve a search warrant.
if you could step aside and move away from the door.
door on the left. Close right.
mom, what's going on? - Two steps back.
two steps back.
deputy chief Johnson, lapd.
and you are? - Kim Reichter.
do you know where your father is?
Los Angeles until Wednesday.
when was the last time you spoke to him?
friday night. Mom, what is he doing over there?
leave those pictures alone!
you can't invade our privacy! - Mom...
but what are they looking for?! - Mom!
I have a right to know! Why are you here?
answer me!
Hey! - Answer me!
Mrs. Reichter, meet Kevin Alan Wallace.
did you know your husband was a bigamist?
it's just...
hard to take in everything.
and, uh...
all of the other family were stabbed to death?
except the son, yes.
Dr. Reichter left Lompoc on Friday.
weren't you worried when you didn't hear from him?
we're used to Robert's schedule.
he used to come to terminal island here in L. A.
every other week, and I'm on nights at the prison in Lompoc.
did you work on Friday?
Yes.
uh, half of our little medical staff was there.
we had a lifer who has colon cancer.
he was very sick.
excuse me. Are you looking for my alibi?
what about your son -- Kim?
where was he on Friday?
wait. Wait, please.
I knew about the Wallaces from the beginning.
I admit.
i-it sounds complicated, but...
I was the one that robert loved, not her.
she was just a -- a convenience.
Really?
well, if she was just a convenience and you knew about her from the beginning,
I wonder why you're using pronouns instead of her real name, unless you don't know it.
hello. - Hi.
so, I come back to see how things are going here and I find that, first, you've had a boy on suicide watch transported to your office under medical supervision.
that's another billion dollars. - I'm sorry about that, but
I need Eric Wallace to identify some things for me.
then I hear you've commandeered the department jet to go to Lompoc.
because I knew I had to bring back passengers and freight.
freight?
Yes. Clothes, financial records, pictures.
so you flew round-trip to lompoc for scrapbooks?
here is a picture of Mr. Wallace, one of our victims.
okay. So?
and here is a picture of Dr. Reichter, the prison psychologist from Lompoc.
Wow.
so your murder victim was a bigamist?
Yes, and now I need to speak to his wife and son.
so if you'll excuse me.
have you talked to Provenza about retirement yet?
no, she hasn't.
should she? - No, lieutenant, no.
aren't you supposed to be in the electronics room?
have you figured out what you're gonna do about us?
sergeant, I've figured out the crime.
I'm kind of putting everything else off.
wait.
if you really don't want to lose Lieutenant Provenza, I think you should...
let me go and work things out with chief Pope.
do you mean that, sergeant?
I've, um -- I've been thinking about it.
and, yes, Ma'am, I'll go talk to him about it when we're through here.
all right, then, let's go.
be sure.
this is important.
I am. These are my clothes.
okay.
Thanks. I'm sorry.
I know it was a long way to come to have your rights read to you and to look through your own closet, especially after what happened to your father, but this was absolutely necessary to figure out who killed your father.
Thanks.
watch it.
look, I did not kill my family!
okay, fine.
then help me for once.
why should I? You don't believe me!
and who's gonna help me?!
who's gonna help me?! What am I gonna do?!
I have no one left!
I don't know how you're gonna feel about it, but that's not exactly true.
now, I've got two more questions for you, and if you tell me the truth, then you and I are done.
fine.
okay, first, did your father call you a lot when he was up at Lompoc?
almost every day.
okay, and do you think that any of the clothes on this rack might be yours?
these are my shoes.
I changed the laces in them.
this is my shirt. It's got a tag from our dry cleaners on the collar.
these jeans.
Yeah.
I put this hole in there myself.
thank you, Eric. - Yeah.
would you get my bag, please? Thank you.
and now, uh, detective Daniels here has some information we'd like to share with you.
information like what?
information about your dad.
why don't you have a seat?
thank you. Detective.
and that will be all, gentlemen. Thanks.
I don't want to bother you again, Kim, but you identified these clothes that I brought in earlier as yours
this shirt and these pants and these shoes.
and they're so much nicer than your other clothes, so I checked with your half brother, Eric, and he says they're his.
and I kind of believe him.
now, I don't know if you know this, kim, but I can actually tell from these clothes and from the wounds in the body the order in which you murdered your father and his wife and your half sister, Jenny.
because the weapon that you used the letter opener -- actually degraded as you went along.
so, first, you attacked your father.
and then his wife heard him screaming or was there.
you fought with her.
and you stabbed her to death and then went back and finished with your dad.
Jenny ran down to see what was the matter.
you chased her back upstairs stabbed her to death, too.
these are your clothes, which you put in the washer while you showered, but you looked for your father's cellphone first.
so the stains set in, and it's no good driving around in bloody clothes, is it?
someone might notice.
so you stole these clothes from Eric's closet.
and it's not surprising that they fit.
you are brothers, after all.
these are the fingerprints that we found on the ladder that you used to enter the house.
now, we haven't identified them yet, Kim, but when we do, I'll bet they match your hand.
and somewhere, you stopped to fill up your car.
and I'm gonna check the surveillance cameras of every gas station along the way, and I'm gonna find you, kim, somewhere along the road between here and Lompoc.
I can promise you that.
now, all we have left to decide, really and this is only if you want to help me
is if you planned on killing your father and his family, or if it was more of a spur-of-the-moment type thing, - stabbing your father and his wife. - Let's get one thing straight.
that other woman wasn't my father's wife, okay?
okay.
my mother was his wife, not her.
okay.
and I never meant to kill anyone.
okay.
how did that happen, then?
my father loaned me his car while mine was in the shop.
and I bought some pot, okay?
and I was hiding it to take home in case I got stopped by the police.
and there's a zipper in the upholstery of the driver's seat of my dad's car.
and I pulled it open, and it all just fell in my hands.
his other driver's license, his other cellphone, his other credit cards, his other life.
and I couldn't stop thinking about it.
I couldn't.
so you went to the other address on your father's fake license.
and there they all were in their big house with their swimming pool and their fancy cars.
and I tried to stop going.
but I couldn't.
I just kept going back there every day, and I would just watch them come and go with all their friends and stuff.
and I saw Eric sneaking out of his bedroom window.
my father would have killed me if I had done that.
so that night, when he went out, you just wanted to see his room.
is that right?
I don't know what happened.
I couldn't stop myself.
I didn't know that going in there would make me so so mad.
two laptops, cable in his room, tivo, video ipods
we didn't have any of that stuff!
and I was standing there, and I saw that picture of my father and him, some place
I think Hawaii, maybe. The next thing I know, I was downstairs, and I was yelling at my dad.
and that woman came in, and I told her who I was, and he said, "don't listen to this kid."
he's a convict I work with in Lompoc.
he's a convict I work with.
that's what my father called me.
so I picked up that little sword on his desk, that fancy letter opener or whatever it was, and I stabbed him with it.
and the rest happened like you said.
you broke into your father's car?
Yeah.
I couldn't find where he kept the keys to it.
I got his real driver's license out of the seat, his real credit cards, and I thought...
well, I never knew he was two people.
maybe no one else would find out.
except I couldn't find his stupid cellphone.
so I left with the one I had, and I threw it in the ocean on my way home.
why did you keep Eric's clothes?
they're nice.
his stuff is nice.
I'm sorry about the girl.
she came downstairs and saw me.
I am so sorry about her.
so, on paper, you transfer everyone from priority homicide to the counterterrorism bureau.
whoa, you guys don't have the mandated training for that.
well, see, sir, that's the best part.
the federal government will actually pay you to bring us up to code, thousands of dollars per person which you could add to your budget shortfalls.
well... that's...
that's fantastic.
so, officially, you would all be transferred to the counterterrorism bureau, which would satisfy the state, but in actuality, I could just loan you right back to priority homicide.
exactly, 'cause you only need more people in counterterrorism when the threat level goes up.
if you were to transfer them there permanently
I'm paying people to stand around most of the time.
Yeah, I hate that. - Yeah.
you know, sergeant, for bureaucrats, this plan of yours is the equivalent of turning water into wine.
my only question is, why are you here suggesting it, instead of chief Johnson?
uh, well, sir, I thought she might like this idea better if she thought it was my idea.
Uh-huh, well, I see you've worked out every detail, including who she's going to blame.
that's real genius.
all right, say I do this.
your chief is still spending like a madwoman.
now, it's not good for one division to have everything while everyone else is cutting back.
I completely agree, sir, and I will do everything I can to remind her of that along the way.
it's very impressive, sergeant.
it's, uh...
really, it's very impressive.
thank you, sir. Thank you so much.
thank you.
I'll just
Yeah, I'll hang on to this. - Okay.
thank you, sir.
Hey.
what?
Oh.
Hey. - Hey.
you brought in all your stuff from the garage.
I did.
come see.
come see.
there's a barbecue in the bathroom.
uh, honey, do you think that my books will look better if I put the shelving up around the ceiling in here, or should I try the kitchen?
actually, don't go in there yet.
that room's still a little crowded.
okay. Okay. Okay.
okay, you win.
I think we should put this little house on the market and find someplace else to live.
you sure?
I only want to do this if you're ready to move on.
well, I honestly, I do hate change a lot.
change is -- it's just -- it's bad.
But?
but, um...
but I think it's important, in a relationship like ours, to keep all of our stuff in one place.
thank you.
thank you.
thank you.
do I have to help you put all this stuff back?
Oh, yeah.
Oh, absolutely.
Ah, maybe not tonight.
officer-involved shootings often bring up feelings of remorse and/or guilt, even if the officer's life was threatened.
how have you been feeling since the attack?
any nightmares? - No. I'm fine.
well, I haven't been sleepingmuch lately, but that's perfectly normal for someone going throughearly onset menopause, which I might beaccording to my doctor.
any flashbacks?
no, just the occasional hot flash.
so, you're fine?
nothing major going on in your life?
Yes. No.
well, uh, not --not really.
um, my parentsare coming to town today, and my daddy'snever met Fritz, so...
who's Fritz?
my boyfriend -- uh, fianc?
we just got engaged.
Oh, my --my ring's in my purse. I'm getting it sized.
and, I'm a --w-w-we're buying a house.
so, then, other than possible early on set menopause, getting engaged, having your parents come into town, buying a new house, and being attacked with a cattle prod then shooting and killing your assailant, there's nothing significanthappening in your life?
why do you have to say it like that?
so, I'm done? I can go?
that's up to you.
Brenda, if you're ever feeling unfine, come back and see me.
I will. Thank you.
so, I...
thank you. Bye.
it was very helpful.
good.
you're always saying I need tolisten to outside opinions more, and the opinion of our best psychiatrist is that I'm readyto go back to work.
Really? Ready for work --That's what she said?
Yeah, more or less.
to chief Pope, from dr. Leonard, R.E.
you -- deputy chief Johnson is not fit for full investigative duties.
she is exhausted, disconnected, distracted, and in denial of deep emotional issues.
allowing deputy chief Johnson to resume a full workload could put her and other membersof the lapd at risk.
well, that is just...Nuts.
according to the department shrink, so are you.
but since making you stay at home will only make matters worse
Greg Pierson, a reporter for channel 8, wants to do an investigativepiece on the lapd
I know, but this is a good one.
he wants to draw attention to how overburdened and under staffed we are, and that's a storywe need to get out there.
so, you want meto talk to this reporter?
I was thinking a ride-alongwith the deputy chief and head of priority homicide might be a nicegesture of cooperation.
pick Pierson upat his office.
and, Brenda, I know he looks like a 9th grader, but he's very shp, so please keep your answersas simple and clear as possible.
are you seriously giving me advice on how to handlean interview?
Yes, I am.
just please don't make news.
hey Fritzy.
where are you? You were supposed to be home by now.
I'm at work. What are you doing?
what am I doing?
I'm trying to clean up this place beforeyour parents get here.
no. No. No. No. Don't clean up.
I'll do that when I get home, which will be a little bitlater than I thought.
wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. No. No.
you're not suggesting that I pick up your dad, who I have never met, all by myself?
you've met my mother. She'll introduce you.
look, don't worry.
my daddy has a great senseof humor, and my mother, she's just gonna bereading signs all the way backto the hotel anyway.
just let them droptheir bags, check in, and I'll meet youat home later. Okay?
no. You can't - - I promise.
Oh, and, uh, don't say anythingabout the engagement, okay?
no. Wait. Bren
Hello, Sergeant. - Hiya, chief.
good to see you back.
Yoo-hoo, Lieutenant Provenza.
Pope asked me to drive Youand Greg pierson around to free you up to talk to them, so...
Pope? He's your buddy, now, huh?
you don't have to call himchief Pope?
I suppose he assigned youto babysit me?
where are y'all going?
nowhere.
has there been a homicide? - Yeah.
and, this one's prettyinteresting, too, chief.
dead body found inside a roomthat's locked from the outside.
now, inside, there are no windows and no locks.
Really? - No.
some academy award-winningwriter found deadin the Hollywood hills.
probably O. D.'D he was only a nomination. He didn't actually win.
um, you wantto come along?
what's the address? - No!
if you give her that address, iswear to god I will tell Pope -- chief Pope.
I'm sorry, chief.
well, I'm driving.
a-actually...
should we be talkingor something?
just do what you normally do. Pretend we're not even here.
does he really need to filmthe back of my head?
just act natural.
she is.
maybe we should just stop bythe crime scene for one minute.
no. No.
what I'm really hoping for here, you guys, is a sense about how outnumbered you are.
now, I-I did a little research. I got a couple addresses.
supposed to be gathering placesfor one of the local gangs.
washington and Ridgeley.
take Franklin. It's faster.
Franklin's not evenon the way.
Franklin takes usinto the hills, and we are notgoing there.
that wasa bit of a let down.
maybe the next address will be a little more exciting.
now, if you don't mind my asking, what makes a homicidea priority?
I mean, how do you, um, prioritize murders, anyway?
uh, well, three bodies or more, critical missingswith children, homicides involving high-profile individuals.
actually, you guys sometimes have more to do with that determinationthan we do.
you know, maybe we should just check and see if there's an example of one of these high-profile cases.
maybe not.
so, essentially, rich, white people are considered more important than poor minorities?
no, sir.
just seems that waybecause of the media coverage.
does the Lapdalso have priority divisions for theft or for rape?
well, I'm not really qualified to answersome of your questions, but if you really want to seehow we work, we should just take youto a priority crime scene.
sergeant Gabriel, you know the address, I presume.
chief Pope has suggested we let Mr. Pierson direct our route today.
would you like me to call inand ask him if he wants us
down!
532h. Officer needs help. Shots fired.
we're at the corner of --damn it.
Santa fe, 400 south.
need help now!
sergeant, I need a towel!
all units, officers need help. 400 south, Santa Fe. Shots fired.
Oh, help him.
Oh, my...
Oh, my...
Ah, chief.
I know. I know, Sergeant.
532 Henry, come in.
we need help now!
it's okay.
Santa Fe, 400 south! - It's okay.
it'll be okay. Help is coming.
officer needs help. Hang in there, man.
just calm down, all right. Just calm down. Just breathe.
help him. Oh, my god.
no. Wait. Wait.
okay. I got you. I got you.
Oh, right.
Mr. Johnson, I-I'm sorry.
t-the cat was trying to -- the -- I'm sorry.
man ought to have a dog. Can talk sense to a dog.
Where's Brenda? I thought you said she'd be here by now?
Yeah, I did. She must have hit some traffic.
can I get yousomething to drink?
iced tea.
I don't think they haveiced tea, Clay.
of course they have iced tea. Everybody's got iced tea.
not in los angeles.
don't do that.
I didn't say anything.
you were going to.
I have ice, and I think I have tea.
you know, I think he couldreally use a Bourbon.
I bet they don'teven have Bourbon.
make it a double. He's driving me crazy.
are you all right? W-what happened?
Oh, no. This blood -- it's not mine.
this is, uh, Chad, and, uh, this is Roy.
they'll be staying with usfor a bit.
Oh, honey.
I'm fine. Mama, I'm fine.
I just -- I need to shower. Daddy.
uh, Willie Rae, let her go.
there are two swat guysin the living room, a black-and-white outin front of the house.
tell me what happened.
there was a shooting.
I tried to help the victim, but he didn't make it.
look, I don't want my parentsto worry about me, and you shouldn't be in here when they're out there.
would someone mind telling me what's going on?
I'm sorry, Ma'am. I'm not at liberty to say.
say what? That someonetried to shoot my daughter?
so you already know? - Of course.
just not all the details.
well, Ma'am, your daughter and Sergeant Gabriel weren't hit.
one of the passengerswas killed. The other one'sgonna make it.
kitchen's clear.
so, as you can see, I'm fine.
now, how are you and daddy getting along?
I don't know. Where's your ring?
Oh, it's, uh, in my purse in evidence.
sorry.
look, please don't leavemy parents alone out there, and please don't tell themI got shot at.
you got shot at? - Yes, but they missed.
look, now we gotthe Swat detail, so everything's gonna be fine.
please, just please, look after my parents.
okay.
okay.
so, y'all readyto go to dinner?
Roy said someone was trying to kill you.
sorry, Ma'am.
you had no choice, son.
we're staying here.
no. No. No. That's not necessary.
honey, we've alreadycancelled the hotel, and Roy's sending a squad carto pick up our luggage.
I'll cook something.
no. W-we're going outto dinner.
Hey, maybe we should take it easy?
no. I'm not gonna let this ruin our fun.
just because we have this silly swat detail doesn't mean that we can't do what we were planning, like going to the beachand Chinatown.
honey, the only site we're here to see is you.
Oh, all right, then.
but y'all are gonna stay in my bedroom, okay?
Oh, no. No, you're the onethat got shot at.
we'll sleepon the fold out.
the only question is...
Where's Fritz gonna sleep?
Oh, but --well, I -- I
who WOULD WANT TO KILL CHIEF JONNSON??
we're gonna need a bigger board.
we've moved that writer suicide over to Hollywood division, so you all are on this shooting full time now.
chief Johnson believes thatyou are the best detectives in the building, so prove her right.
lieutenant Provenza, you're in charge. What do you got?
ballistics confirmed our casings are. 223 rounds.
M16, ar15 -- some kind ofserious firepower.
probably gangs.
Santa Fe, Mateo --that's not big gang territory, but they do travel, and she'sticked off plenty of them over the past couple of years.
I've been on the line with special investigators at the county lockupand the state prisons.
now, they're following up to see if any of their snitches have heard anything about a hit on a cop.
we're checking out everybody that chief Johnson has either arrested, investigated, or helped convict, along with their friends and families, starting with the most recent and are working our way back.
I'm expecting a similar list from Atlanta.
what about D. C?
there were a lot of people that hated her there.
already contacted them.
all right, so, is that it? - No, sir.
in about 20 minutes, we are interviewing the witnesses.
Oh, hello, Sergeant.
so, how you doing?
I'm a -- I'm kind of pissed at being shot at, but, um, how are you?
I'm so sorry.
for what? You didn't do anything.
I almost got you killed.
Oh, forget it, chief. That's a
and I have been so mean to you.
chief, really, it's okay. I-I'm fine.
all right, let's get thisover with, huh?
here you go, chief.
uh, who's gonna interview who?
call it.
tails. - Heads.
come on, Gabriel.
so, chief, this is a little awkward.
no, Lieutenant. Go right ahead.
when do I get my purse back?
your purse.
um, your purseis in evidence. Okay.
so, do you have any leads? Anyone seethe shooter's car?
time out.
I'm more interested right now in your recollections, starting with what route you took.
uh, we were headed weston Santa Fe, and chief wanted to come to your crime scene instead.
I wouldn't take her there.
did you see where the shots came from?
I felt it.
it was coming from my rightside, and it sounded close, but, um, I didn't, uh --I didn't see anything.
nothing?
anything might help. - No.
and, I've been trying, but I can't rememberseeing anything
not a face, not a color of a car.
I don't even know if there was a car there.
I should have been paying more attention.
I'm sorry. - It's okay, Sergeant.
just take it easy.
have you received any death threats, had any unusual contact with gang members or subjects of a past investigation?
no. - What about your love life?
dating anybody who might have an angry ex-boyfriend?
no ex-boyfriends that I know of.
but you are dating someone?
Yeah.
does this somebody have a name?
detective Daniels? Who knew about this?
saw them at the movies.
how long have you and she been, um, uh...
about a year now, and in that time,
I haven't met any of her exesor she hasn't mentioned any.
now, can we move on?
we were pulling away from a stop sign, and I heard a loud report, so I dropped down to the floor.
and, how many shots did you hear? - Five.
15, maybe 20.
how many timesdo I have to say it? I heard five shots.
I remember counting five. I told myselfto be sure to count.
seemed like it went on forever.
and, there weresome other noises...
some screaming.
you sure?
lieutenant, I'm positive.
Pierson's cameraman kept rolling the whole time.
ma'am, are you sure you want to see this?
Yes. Yes, I am.
buzz, play it, please.
Pierson direct our route today. Would you like me to call in and ask him if
Oh. I could have sworn it was five.
21 shots were fired, lasting 4. 3 seconds.
buzz, roll the crime-scene video.
now, it looks as though the shots came from one position
either stationary, or a slow-moving vehicle.
deputy chief Johnson and Sergeant Gabriel have blood on them...
none of which appears to be theirs.
the casings we did find were in one area, like the asshole was waiting.
Hey, folks, you want to step back, please?
is she all right? - She's fine. She's fine.
lieutenant Provenza, keep me updated.
and you two go home. Take the rest of the week off.
I'm sure you both have significant others who are worried about you.
right.
people think we don't get shot at.
buzz, get the car.
you two were lucky.
no. I don't believe in luck.
you know what, Lieutenant?
if I were running this investigation,
I'd want the witnesses to see that car in person.
you know, I was just thinkingthe same thing.
lieutenant Tao.
uh, lieutenant Tao, how many casings were recovered at the crime scene?
we're trying to, um, jog the witnesses' memory.
21 casings.
and, how many bullets hit the car?
well, I can't say for sure 'cause a couple could havegone through the windows, which wouldn't leave bulletholes, but I'm counting 17.
17 or more out of 21?
all concentratedin the same area.
that's pretty solid marksmanship.
Yeah, but he missed. - No. He didn't miss.
I wasn't his target.
you can either slap me on the wrist about insufficient neighborhood police presence, or you can tell me you're taking that money out of my budget.
pick one.
when might chief Pope have a moment to speak with me today?
Hey. Are you okay?
better than okay.
great. That's great. Why?
because the guy you thought was trying to shoot at me was actually shooting at Greg Pierson.
so, you can call offthe swat team, and I can get onwith doing my job and investigatingthis murder.
not gonna happen. - But why?
until we have the shooterin custody, the security detail stays in place.
you are too important to this department.
well, I'm flattered, but I cannot operateunder these conditions.
maybe I should remind you that you're not supposed to be operating at all until you are cleared for active dutyby Dr. Leonard.
come on, Will.
nobody has to know.
good. Nobody has to know. Good.
that will make it like Gabriel and Daniels dating for a year.
well, it's not like they're partners.
I don't care. That's important enough that I would have expected you to tell me about it.
look, we can talk about this later.
right now you need to go home.
is that an order? - Yeah, if it has to be.
guess I didn't realize how much I was bothering you.
crap.
once again, Chad, I-I did not mean to hurt your feelings.
it's okay. - Now, what are you gonna tell chief Pope?
that we went straight home.
thank you. Thank you so much.
Mr. Kimble, how are youfeeling today, sir?
I remember putting my cameradown, and that's it.
Mr. Kimble, we're very sorry about your friend.
Thanks.
you know, I've been doing this job long enough to recognize the real deal.
this kid, he had -- he had network written all over him, and I guess I kind of thought he'd bring me with him.
I was wrong.
I'm so sorry about all of this, just so sorry.
thank you.
it's all just so unfair.
Greg was such a good man.
the work he did.
you're pulling a Pierson. - Excuse me?
you know, kiss ass and lie to your subject till they tell you the story you want.
I wasn't trying to - -I worked with Greg.
I've seen the technique enoughto recognize it.
you're saying Greg lied to people?
who did he lie to?
everybody.
he lied to you guys. - He did?
Greg wasn't doing a feature on the over Burdened Lapd.
he was about to expose how incompetent you are.
Really? We're incompetent?
well, there are thousands of fugitives in L. A.
who you guys say you can't catch.
Greg did some basic research, followed up a few simple tips, and found a bunch of them.
one of them crashed at those two addresses he gave you.
so, while we thought Greg was actually helping us out, he was setting us upto look like idiots.
that is not cool.
well, like Greg used to say, sometimes you have to lieto tell the truth.
well, in my experience, most people don't like being lied to.
what was this fugitive's name?
I don't know.
all right, uh, Sergeant Gabriel, would you please have Lieutenant Provenza look into those two addresses?
see what a little basic research turns up.
and, Mr. Kimble, if you could give me some background information on anyone else who might have had a pierson pulled on them, I would greatly appreciate it.
these gas pumps aren't just taking your money.
they're taking your identity.
tonight, I'll expose the southland gas stations that are the biggest culprits, and we'll tell you how to protect yourself against this all-too-common crime.
fast-forward.
stop.
at these four-star restaurants, not all the wild animals end up on your plate...
Fritz, did you know Roy hereraises german shepherds?
no. I didn't know that.
Roy and I haven't really had much of an opportunity to chat.
some of his dogs have been trained to smell drugs.
just one -- klaus.
he's a good boy.
Hey, get that camera out of here.
all of you get out of here before I call the cops.
you -- it's a free country, sir. It's a free country.
get out of here.
fast-forward.
my mom's gonna be bummed when she hears this guy died.
she loved him.
such a nice-looking young man.
he's the first guy I've come across that seems to realize that L. A.'s nuts.
who'd want to kill him?
corporate accountants, lawyers, city councilmen, insurance company
Oh, pause it! Pause it!
please. - Please. Pause it.
what is going on, Brenda?
Greg Pierson gave me two addresses when we were in that car.
excuse me, daddy.
his cameraman said he was following up on some tips.
I think I might know where those tips might have come from.
lieutenant Tao, uh, I need you -- what?
Oh, it's, uh, 11: 30.
Oh, right.
I'm sorryfor calling so late.
I need you to pull somephone records for me, please.
it's an 800 number.
I did you one better than that, chief.
the network records all their tips, and they keep all their recordings.
in case they get sued, I guess.
I know where you can find Alberto Ramirez.
sir, can you please tell us your name and
excuse me.
thank you.
what's going on here?
Hello, commander.
pardon me, but didn't chief Pope forbid you two to be involved in this investigation?
well, we're just doinga little follow-up, commander, with our primary witnesses.
don't you usually do that at the home of the witness?
Oh, my goodness, commander, with the price of gas?
Yeah, so, we thought wewould just save the department a few bucks by bringing them down here.
well, I suggest you get them out of here before chief Pope comes back in.
if he finds you're helpingviolate policy, especially on a case involvinga member of the press...
thank you, commander.
you're welcome, chief.
he's staying at 549 ridgeley.
if he's not there, you can find him at 2107 mateo.
okay, let me just repeat that.
Hello? Sir?
so the caller sets Pierson up.
gives him two addresses, and while you're on your wayto the first one, he has time to set upat the other.
and 2107 Mateo doesn't even exist, but it's right near the intersection where you two got hit.
and what about the fugitive, Alberto Ramirez?
okay, he used to live at 549 ridgeley, but the guy's been in jail for two months. He's a junkie.
where did the call come from?
private residence. Mr. And Mrs. Deke Hawthorn.
Deke Hawthorn -- isn't that the Hawthorn lodge guy?
Oh, man, I love that place. - What place?
well, it's an L. A.Institution, chief, one of the oldest steak houses in the city.
steak house -- you're not doing the place justice.
it's a, uh, wild game restaurant.
you know, elk, venison.
the Hawthorn Lodge.
they closed, like, over a year ago.
they closed? Why?
I think I know.
this report contains some shocking video that may be difficult for more sensitive viewers.
Hey, get that camera out of here.
all of you get out of here before I call the cops.
you -- it's a free country, sir.
okay, freeze that.
okay, that old guy there, that's Deke Hawthorn.
his grandfather opened the restaurant in the '20s.
he's a big-game hunter --whole family is.
the weekly special usually consisted of whatever they brought back from the hunt.
okay. Roll the crime-scene video.
and two months later they have to close down.
a lot of people trusted this guy.
losing a family business -- that's motive.
maybe we should talk to Deke Hawthorn.
what's the matter with you?
I can't believe it. I may have eaten rat droppings...
and forensics are looking for shrapnel.
okay. Go back...
okay, stop there, buzz.
he look familiar to anyone?
that's the same guy that's with Deke Hawthorn in that news video.
okay, Lieutenant Provenza, find Deke Hawthorn, please, and see if he knows who this young man is, and then bring them both in.
let's see if we can find out exactly whose voice is on that tip-line.
So...Are you going to interview them?
I am...
not allowed to participate in any investigation.
mama, why are you reading yesterday's newspaper?
your father has today's.
I'll read that one tomorrow.
you know, I was thinking, you could invite some of your friends from work over tonight.
we can have a cookout.
mama, they're busy working.
do you need pancakes, sweetheart?
no. I'm not hungry.
I'll make some pancakes.
Roy, Chad, would you boys like to help me in the kitchen?
Yes, Ma'am.
she never listens to me.
are we upsetting you? - No.
do you want us to go? - No, daddy.
I am upset, but not at you.
it's that stupid psychiatrist who won't let mego back to work.
which probably thrills you to no end 'cause you've been wanting me to quit being a police officer since the day I arted.
all we've ever wanted was for you to be happy.
I am happy, daddy.
what can't youjust accept that?
look, honey...
when you wanted to go to George town, I said no, and you went anyway.
when you wanted to go to workfor the state department, I said no.
well, you did it anyway.
then when you called and said you're going to workfor the D. C.Police, your mama nearly had to sit on me to keep me from driving the van up there and kidnapping you.
over the years, I've tried to stand in your way several times, and you always ran right over me. Capiche?
if you want to goback to work, you go back to work.
I've always found it's easier to ask for forgiveness than permission.
know what I mean?
aren't you supposed to beat home?
just poking my head in.
mind waiting out here for a minute, please?
Hi, everybody.
fine.
did you talk to the psychiatrist?
no. What'd I miss?
well, two months after Pierson's rat expos? the Hawthorn Lodge closed.
six months after that, Deke Hawthorn dies.
how? - Pills. 20 of them all at once.
so, who's our friend from the news video?
it's Bill Hawthorn. Deke's son.
he used to work for his dad, but now he's a waiter at a diner downtown.
lives at home with mom.
it could have been Bill who called the tip-line.
did you search their house?
the Hawthorns own eight registered rifles.
looks like everyone in the Hawthorn family hunted.
we found seven at the house.
the one that was missing was an AR15.
Mrs. Hawthorn said it was up north at the family lodge.
so, no rifle.
did Lieutenant Flynnread Mr. Hawthorn his rights?
well, of course he did, chief, and the kid waived them, but he doesn't have much to say, and our evidenceis circumstantial.
your evidence isn't circumstantial. It isn't even evidence.
it's supposition and coincidence.
you don't even have the murder weapon.
w-wait a minute, chief. Just wait a minute here.
maybe Flynn can get this kid to - -let him go.
but if we let him go, he could lawyer upor he could leave town.
well, he isn't talking, and you guys don't have any evidence, so I don't see what other choice you have but to let him go.
nice to see y'all.
you know what? You look very familiar.
Really?
where do I know you from? - I-I don't know.
you're going down, right? - Yeah, thanks.
we've met before. I know we have.
I don't think so, Ma'am.
are you sure? I could have sworn...
excuse me.
Oh, we're going up. Shoot, I'm sorry.
you know, it's funnythat you don't remember me because I remember you.
Yeah, I really just don't...
grab the next one.
you're the man who tried to kill me.
what? That's not true.
Oh, it is true, and I can prove it.
you knew I was gonna be with Greg Pierson three days ago, and you called his tip-line with two bogus addresses so you could lure meto that street corner where you were waitingto kill me.
but you missed.
you don't know what you're talking about.
channel 8 recorded your voice on this tip-line.
I know where you can find Alberto Ramirez.
are the elevator security cameras on?
uh, yeah.
can you pull up this one?
do you have audio?
sergeant, I thought I told you to take the rest of the week off.
you have no idea what you're talking about.
the security cameras are recording everything you and I are saying in this elevator right now.
so all I have to do is match what you say in here to that message you left on the tip-line in our voice-recognition lab, and I can positively identify you.
we got a voice-recognition lab?
no.
I can also match the gun shot residue on your hands and face.
Oh, I'm sure that you've washed them thoroughly since then, but unless you wash them with iodine and bleach, that residue stays on your skin for five days.
it doesn't.
and I'm quite sure that it will match your father's AR15 rifle, which you could have easily converted into an automatic weapon using a $20 kit you bought on the internet.
look, lady, I don't know who you think I am, but I don't know anything about any of this, okay? You're crazy.
I...am...not...crazy.
I'm not the one who shot 21 rounds into a police car.
I'm not the one who tried to make it look like a gang drive-by.
I'm not the one who killedone person, wounded another, and then returned to the scene of the crimeto admire his handiwork.
you don't understand
do you have any idea how the Lapd feels about someone who tries to kill one of their own?
two of their own?
my partner, my friend, was in that car with me.
and it doesn't end with the police, Bill.
judges, juries, prison guards
they all share a special contempt for someone who tries to hunt down and murder a police officer.
that's a capital crime, Bill.
you think this elevator's small?
just wait until you step into the gas chamber.
why are you doing to me? - Why am I doing this to you?
you're the one who tried to kill me.
no, I didn't. I swear to
Yes, you did. I was there, Bill.
a bullet went into the back of my car seat, and if I hadn't ducked, I would be dead.
and what did I ever do to you? What did I ever do?
nothing. I swear.
why did I deserve to sit curled up in the footwell of my car while blood and glass rained down on me?
why me, Bill? Why did you try to kill me?
I wasn't aiming at you!
it was him! Pierson. He killed my father.
your father committed suicide. - No, he didn't!
Pierson killed him with that story he did on our restaurant!
hawthorn Lodge was my dad's life.
and Pierson destroyed it. He planted those rats!
I know he did!
m-my dad n-never did any thing to deserve that.
he never did anything to anybody.
so you shot him.
Yeah.
I...I never meantfor anyone else to get hurt.
I didn't. I did not
I didn't even know you were gonna be there until you picked him upin the car.
and, look, I know how to use a gun, okay?
I was so careful not to aim at you.
and I came back -- I came backto make sure that you were okay.
I did!
and y-you are, you know. You...
you're okay.
people need to know what he did to my dad.
people need to know the truth.
they will.
get back! Back against the wall!
turn around! Turn around! Turn around!
what's going on? - Don't move!
I don't understand what's happening! - Face the wall!
but you're okay.
I'm alive, but I am not okay.
don't ever do that again.
look, I'm gonna need my purseback from evidence...please.
it was really nice of you to invite us for dinner.
it's our way of saying thank you.
so, Brenda, Roy was telling us that we really need to see the
Oh, what is the name of that museum?
the Getty.
ever been, Fritz?
no, Roy, I haven't.
it's awesome.
and your father is interesting in visiting that aircraft carrier at the maritime museum in San Diego.
that seemed a bit of - -Fritz and I are engaged.
I knew it!
nice. Good for you.
how did you know?
a mother knows these things.
and besides, your hand kept reaching over to feel your ring finger as if something was missing.
well, it was in evidence.
here it is.
Oh, honey, that is beautiful.
well, Agent Howard of the Federal Bureau of investigation, did it not occur to you to pick up a telephone and call and ask for my blessing?
well, I-I'm sorry, sir, Butbrenda and I are both adults, and I love your daughter.
relax, son. I'm just messing with you.
come on. You do hug, don't you?
I mean, you have a cat.
that's not my cat.
it is now, son.
and you better make that cat very happy.
Hey, you two, smile.
sergeant Gabriel, priority homicide.
I'm just looking for someone. She's right there.
I'll be one second.
excuse me. Just one second.
the winds changed.
fire's coming this way.
and we have company outside.
okay.
pardon me.
excuse me, guys. - Sorry.
chief Pope.
commander Taylor.
deputy chief Johnson, Sergeant Gabriel...
this is Ricardo Ramos from the times.
he's gonna be trailing priority homicide's investigation.
nice to meet you, chief Johnson.
sergeant Gabriel.
uh, pardon me.
Ricardo, would you mind waiting over there by the bodies for just one moment, please?
thank you so much.
uh, yeah. All right.
four people are dead.
the fire isn't contained.
this entire command center has to move.
the last thing I need right now is a reporter following me around.
she already agreed to a media presence on her next case.
if it were a regular homicide, yes, but it's not.
I can't get anywhere near the fire, and the incident commander won't even talk to me.
Yeah, that's because you're not supposed to be here.
what? Why not?
because before a fire is contained,
l. A.P. D. usually just directs traffic, manages civilian evacuations, tows cars away.
they let you badge your way up here, but we don't even know if this is an arson yet.
there are no electrical wires near the fire's anchor point, so the fire is probably of human origin, sir.
which makes this a massive crime scene.
it's just massive.
so, what are you saying
this case is too big for you?
no, I'm saying it's too big for five fire departments, nine fire engines, four helicopters, and I don't know what all.
it's not a murder anymore.
it's a natural disaster.
would you ask me to babysit a reporter during a hurricane?
people don't start hurricanes.
hurricanes are not crimes.
Taylor, tell the incident commander we're leaving.
sergeant Gabriel, tell Lieutenant Provenza
I want the team back down on Los Feliz Boulevard...now.
we have an injured firefighter and another victim!
get that camera guy out of here.
get him out of here. - Get out of here.
Hey, I got a pass. I can be here. - I don't care.
take it easy. Take it easy. He's with us.
please move.
you know, I should have the authority to reject journalists if I think that they're going to get in the way of my investigation.
okay, authority. What about my authority?
I get orders, too, okay?
and mine were absolutely clear in this case
improve relations between L. A.P. D. And the media.
that is what I am doing.
commander Taylor is assisting me, and I expect your enthusiastic cooperation.
fine, Will. Whatever you want.
besides, it's a big story.
we'd rather have him reporting it from inside than guessing from out on the street.
he might even prove to be an asset of some
Oh, yes, journalists --they're so helpful.
we'll want them on every case.
okay, I take it this is your attempt at enthusiasm.
I'm sorry. I meant to say "yippee."
sergeant.
let's go, Lieutenant. Let's go, go, go.
okay, guys, we got to go.
we're ordered out.
come on, kids.
all right, Buzz, let's cover all our bases.
get as many faces in the crowd as you can.
check and see if anyone's admiring their handiwork?
you got it.
chief, our victims
we got two firemen...
one from Burbank, one from County.
got a hiker --Connie Miranda.
she got trapped in a canyon.
and then a guy golfing
he ran the wrong way off the sixth hole.
that's a guy who could use a mulligan.
lieutenant Provenza, this is ricardo ramos of the Times.
lieutenant Provenza is chief Johnson's second-in-command.
nice to meet you, sir. - Uh-huh.
what about the other woman found?
D. O.A. --Burnt, no I. D.
the fire was started in the middle of the park.
anyone caught running out?
not so far, but how an arsonist could escape this place after we surrounded it, I don't know.
lieutenant Flynn, Ricardo Ramos.
Yeah, I met him...
when he was taking pictures of the dead girl.
I thought it was a rescue.
rescue?
considering how bad she looked,
I'm surprised they brought her back at all.
well, unless stuff is falling out of the body, firefighters always bring the victims back.
she was found near a canyon where the homeless hang out.
might explain why she had no I. D.
here. Let me help you with that.
I have it. I'll get it.
I said I have it, Sergeant.
thank you.
right behind the tape.
where did he go?
where did wh
that's Bill Croelick.
gentlemen...
would you please catch up with Bill Croelick and invite him downtown?
who's Bill Croelick?
he's a pyromaniac who uses alcoholic beverages to set his girlfriends on fire.
he likes the smell of burning flesh.
why isn't he in jail?
we arrested Croelick for murder twice, but our chief witness against him at the first trial disappeared, and he was found not guilty.
we got a conviction in another murder and put Croelick on death row.
but, unfortunately, he was framed in that particular killing.
so now Croelick has a huge lawsuit pending against the state for wrongful imprisonment.
almost settled, and we wouldn't want to disrupt that.
but if Croelick is a person of interest in this fire, that's something I'd like to run with.
this may surprise you, Ricardo, but when a newspaper announces we're looking for people, it sometimes makes them harder to find.
just playing devil's advocate for one moment
by running a picture of this guy's face on the front page is gonna make him a little more recogni
you run that picture in your newspaper, and later on, it turns out that someone saw Croelick in griffith park striking a match, his lawyer will say that our witness I. D.'D Croelick from that photograph in your paper.
besides, you can't refer to Croelick as a known arsonist.
he wasn't convicted as an adult, and his juvenile record is sealed.
but if it were opened, you could read about how Croelick branded his name on a girl's arm during sexual intercourse.
now, listen to me, Ricardo, because I've interviewed Mr. Croelick and I suggested that he might be a killer.
and the next night, when I got home,
I found him waiting for me on my front porch.
he has a habit of doing that when he's irritated
just turning up out of the blue...
in the dark, when you're all alone.
so, you run with that picture, and here's what happens.
you lose all access to the L. A.P. D.
and while we're looking for croelick, Croelick is looking for you.
Hello, Lieutenant Provenza.
uh, no.
have Lieutenant Flynn and detective Sanchez put some undercover people together to watch Croelick's apartment in case he shows up.
thank you so much.
what happens if croelick lights up malibu, and we withheld a picture that could have helped stop him?
a better question would be, what if you run the story and it turns out croelick had nothing to do with the griffith park fire and he takes an instant dislike to you?
let's put it this way.
Ricardo, you have two excellent opportunities of visiting the county morgue this week, and one of them is with me.
I see dead people
lots and lots of dead people.
two smoked, two extra-crispy, and then, this lady here
the combo platter.
first time at the morgue?
Mm-hmm. Gracias.
you're welcome.
should I act like he's not here?
that's what I'm trying to do.
just go ahead, doctor, please.
okay, this lady
I was told she might be homeless, but I don't think so.
not only does she have all her teeth, but, also, they've just been bleached.
how are you holding up there, Ricardo?
Yeah, I'm fine.
then there's the victim's clothes.
she was wearing a rayon dress over a cotton T-shirt.
wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.
are you suggesting that she dressed for the occasion?
in two highly flammable materials.
and no smoke damage to her lungs.
she died before the fire started.
from a pretty serious blow to the skull, and then she was torched afterwards.
and I say torched because her hair, her body, her clothes were drenched in alcohol.
I may be able to rehydrate the hand.
I don't know.
well, she's not as far gone as I would have thought, considering the circumstances.
what? What circumstances?
if you're looking for the epicenter of your fire,
I think she might be right here on my gurney.
what a cute cat.
how did you know I have a cat?
Yes, I have a cat, but that is 100% off the record.
Oh, Kitty!
Hey, news says your fire's 90% contained.
sorry. I was trying to spot smoke this morning.
so I must have, um - right.
hello.
this is Ricardo Ramos from the Times.
he's covering the fire.
Ricardo, my fianc Fritz Howard.
fianc?
when's the happy day?
as soon as we buy a house.
Oh, you're moving out?
in.
yesterday?
six weeks ago.
it's temporary.
I had a bungalow. - We had.
we had a bungalow that I sold...
we sold... - We sold, and, um...
then the house prices got weird, and so we decided to rent.
and the landlord said absolutely, positively no pets, so please don't mention Kitty in your article.
thank you.
excuse me one moment, and then we will go to the hospital and see if we can talk to the firefighters.
honey?
you can't leave the curtains open.
someone is going to see Kitty, and then there will be big, big trouble.
we can't meet the upstairs neighbor because the landlord said no pets.
we have to keep the curtains closed 24 hours a day because the landlord said no pets.
it's like living with Anne Frank.
were you able to fix the toilets?
no, I'm sorry.
Oh, how many more mornings are we gonna be rushing to work to pee?
just please call a plumber. Please.
the landlord should be responsible for fixing the bathrooms.
that's one of the upsides of renting.
if you let me talk to the landlord...
no. No. No.
Kitty stuff everywhere.
okay, fine. If you really have to use the bathroom, go upstairs and meet the neighbor.
ask her if you can use her bathroom.
that's not how I want to meet her.
Hey, wait a minute.
is that why you're still here, drinking coffee?
you went upstairs to the neighbor's and asked to use her bathroom?
no, I took a shower.
what does that mean?
you peed in the
gross! Gross! - Oh, for god's sake.
everything went right down the drain. - And completely unfair.
never do that again. Never!
we both have to use that shower, and I'm not getting back in there until you scrub, scrub, scrub every tile.
just, please, call the plumber.
I...I need this place to be more manageable.
Oh, why do you sit in the window?
bad kitty! Bad!
Oh, I need to get to the hospital.
ricardo said he'd find you later.
you know, you might feel less all "over the place" if you unpacked.
and then just have to box it all up again when we move.
I can't even think about that.
this fire.
where is my brown sweater?
just please call the plumber. Please.
I will deal with it.
thank you.
Chief...Chief...
this way.
so, the fire is still burning.
Croelick is still at large.
Jane Doe is still unidentified, although I talked to all of the firefighters involved, except for the guy that found her -- Tom Merrick.
he's recovering from smoke inhalation.
his wife stepped out to call her family, but she said that he is up and that we can talk to him if it's absolutely necessary.
well, of course it's necessary.
thank you, David.
anything else I should know?
not really.
because if there's a problem in your relationship with Detective Daniels...
no. No. No, no. No, no, not at all.
Oh, thank goodness.
cause I really couldn't handle that right now.
Yeah. Yeah.
okay. Gentlemen, pardon me.
Thanks, guys. - Thank you.
I think she was right about here.
how'd you find her?
well, we were looking for her.
I mean, we thought somebody might be up where we found her.
there's a small canyon where the homeless hang out.
when the brush-burn index goes up, we have to clear them out.
Why?
well, they start cooking fires.
we'd just chased them off the day before yesterday.
usually, they don't come back for a month.
there's this one guy.
he got...mad at us, you know?
he was a little weird.
what did he look like?
he had a baseball cap pulled down over his face.
he hadn't shaved for a few days.
he didn't feel homeless, if you know what I mean.
sorry to bother you at, uh...
listen, I walk out of here tomorrow morning.
two of our firefighters are dead, so bother me, Sergeant.
Yes, sir.
uh, anyone resemble your guy?
take your time, Tom. Be sure.
sorry. I...I try not to look at those people.
you know, when I heard where the fire was...
when they mobilized the whole department,
I thought of that creepy guy, and I wondered.
any idea how someone could start a fire in that part of the park and then disappear before we sealed it off?
maybe he didn't get out.
maybe you'll find another body up there.
you know, arsonists usually aren't the brightest people on earth.
so, you think it was one of these guys?
don't worry about them, Tom.
you did your job.
now let us do ours.
homeless, unshaven guy wearing a cap in hollywood
that narrows it down.
it could have been Croelick.
we think he likes to pick people he thinks won't be missed.
except I don't think our victim was homeless.
I think she was put somewhere where homeless people are known to go.
what did we hear from the fire department?
95% containment.
fire was originally spotted very early by a traffic helicop
a traffic helicopter, which was joined in the air by the police, who circled the anchor point until the fire department arrived.
is that kind of rapid response unusual?
in the mtz, no. - Mtz?
it's a mutual threat zone.
it's not just Los Angeles that's endangered by a fire at griffith park.
there's Glendale. There's Burbank...
uh, Detective Daniels, you -- you were saying?
I think he was about to add Burbank, San Marino, and the county, and that would be it.
Hey, Tao.
we have a name for our -- for our, uh, homeless woman with the bleached teeth?
missing women ages 30 to 50.
of course, if she disappeared last night, - we won't know anything for another 60 hours. - Why?
Oh, Geez. Don't ask him why.
adults aren't considered missing until they've been gone for at least three days, not to mention the hours it takes after that to generate the
why don't you just release this Jane Doe's picture, see if -- see if anyone recognizes her?
okay. So, Croelick's unemployed.
big surprise.
no known associates...
uses only prepaid cellphones...
and no car.
Hey, Ricky, put down my mother's crucifix and get out of my chair.
neighbors say Croelick is polite but distant.
haven't noticed him dating anyone.
and he always has a candle burning in his window.
freak.
eh, we'll find him.
not if he finds you first, Lieutenant.
Hello, just plain Brenda.
spread 'em. Come on!
no one's been this excited to see me in a long time.
well, hello, there, Bill.
what brings you here?
heard you were looking for me.
thought I'd stop by.
no attorney.
happy to answer questions.
so...
deputy chief Johnson, up for a chat?
Tching a fire on the news has all the drama of televised golf.
we don't actually have anything on Croelick
well, except his record, his pathology, and his presence near the scene.
why didn't he bring his attorney?
over 70% of criminals never ask for a lawyer.
afraid it'll make them look guilty.
and it does.
don't take this personally, Lieutenant, but if you don't leave,
I will invoke my right to counsel.
Why? You lost your sense of humor?
fine.
we'll catch up later.
he's controlling the interview.
no, that's what we want him to think.
there, now.
is that better?
improves the odor of the room...
a little.
you know, I'm a little annoyed.
why is that?
when it became obvious you were looking for me,
I went by your house, and the gay boys that you sold it to had no idea where you'd gone.
found a mate?
living together?
how about you, Bill?
anyone special in your life?
Oh, no.
I'm still carrying a little torch for you.
why the interest in my personal life?
when you were at the park last night, did someone stumble across the body of a young woman burned to death?
how young?
Oh, that's a cheap trick.
it's not up to your usual standard.
I asked about victims to determine your specific interest in me.
you were standing across the street from a really big fire.
it just naturally occurred to me, given your interests, that you might have a theory about how it all started.
that's all.
that's all.
that's all.
my attorney would probably want to know if you searched the crowd for anyone else with similar alleged interests and if the swiftness with which you settled on me had something to do with my lawsuit against the state.
who else in that crowd would know more about a fire than you?
a moth...
maybe?
but you have a point.
well, I have a helpful side.
if you took me back there, let me watch the fire's end
it's out of the question.
Oh, come on.
just the two of us and a couple of lawn chairs.
you know, the chemicals in the air should make for a fantastic sunset.
well, no dental-record match from the missing women to our jane doe.
could hold him for a day or two.
add another million to his lawsuit?
I don't think so.
lieutenant Provenza says we still can't I. D. our jane doe.
I'm sorry.
you -- you -- you want to think about it?
no? Really? All right.
well, hate to overstay my welcome.
but we're only just getting reacquainted.
are you gonna arrest me? No.
may I leave when I wish? Yes.
goodbye.
at least give me a confirmable alibi for the hour before the fire.
please.
I'll tell you what.
I go back to griffith park...
now...
or I invoke my right to counsel, and we never talk again
wait! Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.
he took the bait.
Hey, where are we going?
taking you where the fire started.
that's what you wanted.
but a firefighter told us the victim was found up there.
it was night. Smoke everywhere.
your firefighter was disoriented.
no. This way.
so, now we have to pretend he's an arson investigator?
Really?
she's just feeding his ego.
we're 10 minutes away from an arrest.
why don't you -- why don't you button your lip for once and just watch?
it's crazy, you know?
having a wildlife park in the center of a city.
I look around at your little nature preserve.
you know what I see?
it's all fuel.
and you and you and you
rich man, poor man, beggar man, thief.
black man...White man...
deputy chief.
fire doesn't care about your name or rank or badge number.
you're all just bite-size lumps of flesh and bone in the flaming food chain.
God, I'm hungry!
how about you?
I had a big lunch.
speaking of which...
I can still smell her -- your victim
cause she burned right here.
see?
that might be her wallet, I. D.credit cards
all melted away...
along with her face.
got a picture of the remains?
that would be inappropriate.
so judgey.
the area around here
it isn't burned at all.
so, how did the fire slip out of control all the way over there?
Yes.
I think we're looking for another body.
that's not good.
the vegetation back here has all been cut down
dried limbs, dead brush...
dragged from the vicinity of little miss crisp and piled like he meant to take the trash with him.
but the park burning?
no. No, that was a mistake.
where is the other body, Bill?
see, whoever dumped your girl in that pit forgot to make sure she was alone.
and when your killer started his, uh, flamb?
poor little rat.
ran out of the frying pan and started a bonfire.
there you go, Sergeant.
y'all be sure and give him a proper funeral, now.
thank you.
thank you so much.
picking an isolated spot...
cutting it back...
waiting till dark...
and then, in seconds...
all his precautions up in smoke...
the fire moving away from his lady.
happened very, very fast, I'm sure.
like drowning.
well, it might take me some time to prove, but it looks to me like you've led us right to the scene of the crime.
wouldn't you say, Sergeant?
and you described everything so well, it's -- it's almost like you were here when it happened.
well, let's take your implication seriously, see how it holds up.
the lady was dead before she was set on fire.
and pardon me for asking, but, uh, where's the fun in that?
how did you know she was dead?
Well...Should I tell her?
or should you?
he what?
he interviewed Croelick before I did.
how'd you find him before us?
you said he had a lawsuit against the state for wrongful imprisonment.
he called his attorney.
you called his attorney?
to arrange a meeting, yes.
for the record, you didn't find Croelick, okay?
I did.
and I convinced him to come in, so I helped you.
look, all I did was ask a few questions.
you can't ask people questions without telling them what you want to know.
I need his notes and tapes from his interview with Croelick.
what? No. No way. - His photographs, his camera -- everything.
and I will not surrender them. - It's against the law to interfere with a murder investigation.
the first amendment allows me to speak to whomever I want. - It's against the law to aid and abet
you want to hear about against the law,
I'd be more than happy to oblige!
morales thinks he can get a fingerprint off our jane doe.
look, your victim was drenched in alcohol, which is Croelick's M. O.Am I wrong? Huh?
now, he led you to where the fire started.
he showed you how it happened.
what more do you people need to make an arrest?
untainted evidence.
which might be in your notes
I can't give you those, okay?
you know what?
shut up.
we can't even hold Croelick because of you.
you cannot talk to me like that. Shut up.
I am this far from reading you your rights -- this far.
you want to be under arrest?
I'm sorry, chief.
I'll call his editor and see what I can work out.
thank you so much.
may I say something now?
I wouldn't.
no. Mnh-mnh.
we usually get only one or two shots at this, which is why I make the detectives do it.
do what?
we debone the hand of a burn victim and rehydrate the skin for 24 hours.
if it works out, sometimes we can get you a print.
it's too slack.
which is why I need a detective close to our jane doe's size.
you want me to slip the skin of her fingers
over your own.
and gently, too, because it tears.
I know it sounds horrible, but it's just the thumb and two fingers left.
the other two fell off.
here, chief. Let me help you.
um, it'll catch on the rubber, so off with the glove.
I'll tell you what -- eyes on Gabriel.
I'll guide your hand.
see, chief?
there's really nothing to it.
it's just -- just science at work.
there. Done.
Linda Harrell -- 36.
fingerprinted two years ago.
arrested for stalking an ex-boyfriend, breaking into his house.
I talked to her ex this morning.
lives in Oxnard and has an alibi.
he said that Linda always wanted to know where he was, demanded all of his attention.
Yeah, well, anyway, she moved here about two months ago.
no problems that we know of until yesterday, when her boss filed a criminal complaint.
Yeah, Linda failed to make the evening bank deposit after her bar shift was over and didn't show up today.
chief.
could you please gather the evidence that we collected from Linda's house and take it to my office?
thank you so much.
you got it, chief.
sorry, sir.
could we talk later?
I've just executed a search warrant of our victim's house, which is where she was murdered.
her car's missing, and I'm sure that the killer used it to move her body to the park, and I really need to concentrate on finding it.
then I'll be brief.
the L. A.P. D. and the Times have reached a good compromise.
chief Johnson, I am extremely sorry.
that's the first part.
now, chief Johnson accepts your apology.
I do?
that's great.
the rest of the agreement goes like this.
you agree to let Ricardo catch up on our investigation.
in return, Ricardo agrees to give you copies of all of his pictures and notes from the past two days.
you first.
thank you. Chief. - Mm-hmm.
so, anything from this Linda Harrell's house connecting her to Croelick?
no.
her computer was gone, and her desk was emptied out.
judging from the dust patterns on the top of her dresser, it looked like some picture frames were removed.
so someone's connected to her.
that's for sure.
there was no sign of forced entry, suggesting that she knew the killer.
that's inference.
she was a bartender.
could be one of her customers followed her home.
right. A customer who just happened to be an expert arsonist.
anyway, Linda reached for the phone, and the murderer yanked it from the wall.
and grabbed her like this.
put him down, Detective Sanchez.
I just wanted to show him the
talk him through it, please.
will you put me down?!
what are you -- nuts?
okay. The killer pushes Linda into some shelving, and then he drops her to the ground really hard!
then the killer reaches for this bookend and smashed her head in.
she bled out.
killer cuts the carpet in half, rolls her up in it, plops Linda down in her own car, and drives away with her.
Yeah, to the park, where he sets her on fire. I mean, what?
you didn't see her computer there?
any residue on this other half of the carpet?
no.
thank you, gentlemen. I'll take it from here.
a fire hot enough to corrupt computer files beyond recovery would have grabbed some attention, and this was supposed to be a controlled burn.
and the carpet's made out of artificial fabric, maybe even treated with flame retardant.
its fumes could have been poisonous.
but those are the concerns of an experienced arsonist.
could be our killer studied up.
for example, you cover police and fire departments.
could be you've researched everything we've discussed so far.
and what motive could I possibly have?
you don't always solve murders by finding out why.
sometimes it's more about how, which is why I keep asking how could the killer get away?
well, Croelick had the victim's car.
maybe he drove it away somewhere.
helicopters buzzing around, firefighters pouring in, police blocking all the exits
no, he didn't dare go back to the car.
like you, he knew far too much about how police and firefighters work to even try.
would you have burned Linda's body to delay identification only to leave a registered vehicle parked nearby, knowing we would find it?
but you haven't found it.
and that's your problem, isn't it?
explaining how the killer got out of the park with the car after the fire started without being noticed.
you've summed it up perfectly.
interrupting an interview?
we'll talk more later.
thank you so much.
you're welcome so much.
can I have my book, please?
Oh, no. I'll be holding on to these for a while.
the landlord's bringing a plumber by to fix the toilets today.
Oh, wonderful.
I vacuumed all the furniture...
put out a room deodorizer...
got rid of all incriminating kitty evidence.
also, I shoved everything we're not using into the guest room
you know, so the landlord will think we're actually living there.
Oh, I feel badly you had to do all
don't. Because while I was scrub, scrub, scrubbing out the shower,
I finally decided how to deal with your cat.
our cat.
your cat is not coming home until the landlord knows she's there.
but where will he live?
she. With you in your office.
okay. Now, wait a minute. I'm really sorry.
which is good -- I appreciate that.
but if I leave him here, maintenance will take him away.
well, you can stop by the pound every morning and pick her back up.
they take her away, and I pick her up later.
and the inside of our apartment can stop looking like Norway in december.
Brenda, are -- are you here? Hello?
Oh, Kitty. I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry, sorry, sorry.
I have to hurry -- really hurry. - Why? Where are you going?
because during a fire, police manage civilian evacuations, tow cars, and direct traffic, and he still has the keys. I'll explain more later.
okay. Poor Kitty.
could you please make sure that there's water left for him... - Her...
and some food and make sure that the office doors are closed tight, tight, tight.
tight, tight, tight.
uh, you're the hero firefighter that I interviewed in the hospital yesterday, right?
you remember me? I'm deputy chief Brenda Leigh Johnson.
sure.
what a coincidence.
what -- what are you doing here?
just working.
this is where the L. A.P. D.towed all the vehicles from the fire.
you know, and speaking of coincidences, the woman whose body that you carried out of the park
this is her car, a-and you're holding the keys to it.
you remember Sergeant Gabriel here, don't you?
say hello, sergeant.
hello.
Tom Merrick, you have the right to remain silent.
anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
you have the right to an attorney.
if you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed for you by the state.
have you heard and understood these rights?
Yes, I understand, but you're making a big mistake.
well, maybe.
now, i've only one question to ask you myself, but Sergeant Gabriel here thinks that we should arrest you for the murder of Linda Harrell
something about the clearing where the body was found.
what is it, Sergeant?
well, he moved out all the homeless, A. K.A.
possible witnesses, a day ago, so he knew he could carry Linda's body in there without being seen, and all the vegetation was cut back.
to control the burn.
but I say that that's what a firefighter does for a living.
and then there was something about a -- a phone.
lieutenant Tao.
the phone that was ripped off the wall at Linda's house
when you hit the redial button, what shows up are the first five digits of his home phone number.
but Linda had a history of nasty breakups.
maybe she wanted to chat with your wife, and you were just trying to stop her.
and in my opinion, it was just luck that you changed out of your regular clothes into your uniform when you burned Linda's body, but, you know, it was really good luck because while we were looking for an arsonist, you were able to run out of the park with your fellow firefighters, carrying the victim, looking like a hero.
okay, so, the uniform was lucky, but everything else points to murder.
we can't prove that, Sergeant.
be patient and let Mr. Merrick here answer the only question that I think is important.
now think hard and be honest.
did you kill Linda Harrell on purpose?
no. No!
I never wanted to hurt her.
I -- I...I just wanted to stop her from calling my wife.
there was a shelf.
it fell on her. It was a complete accident.
she died before I could get help.
it's the truth. I swear.
I believe you.
see, Sergeant?
we can't hold him for Linda's death.
you're just gonna have to be satisfied arresting him on a charge of arson.
Oh, and, um, four counts of felony murder
one for each of the people who died when your little fire slipped out of control.
wait. Wait. Wait!
I want a lawyer.
yeah? Well, you're gonna need one, buddy boy.
Hey, chief Johnson.
Hi. - Hi.
everything's flushing great.
Oh, thank you so much.
and your friend is in the living room.
Oh, wonderful.
it's so nice to meet you.
goodbye.
friend?
he may have meant me.
move! Get back!
I didn't break in.
move! Further! Hurry up!
your friendly plumber opened the door for me. - Fritz?
and this is hardly an appropriate way - Fritzi?
to greet someone who helped you solve a murder. - Fritz?
your FBI-agent boyfriend is not here.
you're still upset with me, Brenda?
the news says your firefighter was having an affair with an angry, possessive young lady who didn't know he was married.
probably why he sent you to the wrong part of park to begin with.
and you find the right place because of me.
So...Why the, uh...
hostility?
can't you prove your case?
Yes. Yes.
you are completely out of the woods, so why come here? Why?
apology accepted.
and I brought you something...
a gesture towards what I hope will be an amicable parting. May I?
now...
I'm about to settle my lawsuit against the state and take my, uh, $4 million and leave your jurisdiction ver.
and though I'm, you know, flattered by your interest in me,
I think we've taken this relationship about as far as it can go.
you know?
and I think it best for both of us if I regard you as something like...
an old flame.
so...
let's say our goodbyes and wish each other well.
if you're not out of my house in the next 10 seconds,
I'm gonna save the state a whole lot of money.
and I'm not kidding. - Okay.
get out of here. Never come back.
I see you agree with me.
good. Well, I'm off.
I will think of you often, just plain Brenda, and hope to see you not at all.
Hey. Brenda?
Brenda, are you here?
Yes. Hi.
Hey.
Hey. Look at that.
and kitty.
Oh. Yes.
I called the landlord and begged and gave him a huge security deposit and promised him monthly inspections.
well, I have something for you, too.
wait here.
you know, uh...
I know you thought you lost this in the move.
look what I found.
it was ju-- hey, you all right? - Yes.
honey, you look a little -- oh, no, I'm fine.
I just haven't slept in two days, that's all.
yeah?
you'll feel better tomorrow.
never in a million years would I have thought you'd have done something so romantic.
actually, I didn't buy these myself.
well, where did they come from?
Just...Someone I worked with.
a housewarming gift.
good morning.
you know...
we haven't spent any quality time in the guest room yet.
Really?
are you okay? - I'm fine. Just a back spasm.
are you okay? - I'm fine. I'm fine.
old football injury.
shoot!
I'll just let voicemail get it. - No, I'm fine. Please.
go answer. You're vibrating.
well... i was. Hello?
Gabriel said it's a hit-and-run, so it should be an easy day.
yes? - Maybe...
we could meet back in the guest room -- say around noon?
noon? Are you sure?
Oh, I'll be ready. I told you -- it's just a muscle spasm.
Really?
do not doubt the fbi.
I won't.
you and daniels?
working out some kinks, you know? - Yeah, it's a little rough.
morning, sergeant. Commander. Nice tie.
Thanks.
good morning. Oh, what a lovely day.
is she all right?
so, why are we here?
uh, chief, at 6: 10 this morning, a shop owner found what he described as a "dead homeless dude" in the alley behind his building.
so, now priority homicide is handling "homeless dudes"?
well, technically, he's not homeless.
responding officers found a parole I. D.In his wallet saying he lives at a halfway house in north hollywood and that his name is roy wilkinson.
they called me, and I thought it best to get priority involved.
what is that smell? - Margaritas.
one is never enough, two is too many, and 12
well, you're looking at 12.
Yeah. It looks like roy got hit by a car
coroner's investigator estimates the body's been here since 2: 00 A. M.
like I was saying, maybe roy passes out, a drunk driver heads down the alley, runs him over, and keeps going.
there's no lights back here and no sign of skid marks.
I've got officers searching the area for damaged cars and a few more knocking on doors to see if anyone's heard something.
well, no one has answered my original question -- why is this a priority?
chief, this speed bump is roy wilkinson. - Who?
in 1999, roy wilkinson was convicted of manslaughter after killing his girlfriend, carly mayhan.
it's amazing, commander -- two pieces of bullshit in one sentence.
first, carly wasn't his girlfriend.
he picked her up in a bar.
and, second, manslaughter, my ass!
it was flynn's case. I think it's safe to say that he took issue with the jury's verdict.
they should have put this guy in jail for life.
instead, he only gets eight years.
Carly mayhan is davis mayhan's daughter -- the movie producer.
it was all over the news.
not in atlanta.
somebody must have used roy's name on an open channel.
well, chief johnson, you might want to tune in tonight, because I assure you every network is going to run with this story.
well, commander, don't let me stand between you and the cameras.
chief, I could do a thorough investigation right now.
a murdering scumbag alcoholic passes out in an alley and gets run over by a car, leaving the world a much better place.
I'll write it up, and we'll all be home by noon.
look, I'd love to be done with this by noon.
you have no idea how much I'd like to be done with this by noon.
but we have a dead body, a bunch of nosy reporters, and somebody fled the scene.
so nobody is gonna be done with anything by noon!
now, who has the number for the halfway house?
the place is run by a private foundation.
they call it a re-entry center.
this one is hooked up with the parole program at victorville.
Yeah, most of these slugs treat parole like a weekend pass.
they don't even get unpacked before they're back into trouble again.
I'm karen silva. I'm the manager here. Can I help you?
Yes, madam. We're with the L. A.P. D.
we wanted to talk to you about roy wilkinson.
what happened?
I'm afraid there's been an accident, madam.
Roy was hit by a car. - Roy's dead.
Oh, no. What happened?
um, they found him in an alley early this morning.
it appears he'd been drinking.
poor roy. It's a shame he fell off the wagon.
Yeah, more like under it.
you don't seem surprised.
I've learned not to be surprised anymore.
I thought roy was getting better.
people just don't understand how hard it is for these men.
hard for them?
lieutenant... why don't you go interview sleeping beauty over there, while ms. Silva shows us roy's room?
that sound good? - Sure. Come with me.
this is roy's bunk.
which one of these dressers is roy's?
the one on the right.
no family photos.
Roy was like most of the guys who wind up here.
if he had any family, they didn't want to have anything to do with him anymore.
how did, uh, how did roy get along with the other residents?
well, I'm not here around the clock, but I would know if there were any problems.
I did hear that someone on the outside was hassling him.
who would that be?
I asked him. He didn't want to talk about it.
that's his one-year A. A.Chip.
he just got it.
he was so proud.
did -- did roy have a job?
he just lost another one.
do you think that might be one of the reasons why roy started drinking again after a year of sobriety?
I've learned through experience that alcohol doesn't need a reason.
I think these should cover everyone who's been in residence here for the last year and a half.
thank you. If you think of anything else at all, please give us a call.
Yes, do.
um, could you get us a copy of roy's death certificate?
for... - well, there won't be a funeral.
they'll just cremate him unless somebody sees to the details. I don't think that's right.
no, that doesn't seem right. I'll make sure we send one over.
thank you.
thank you, Ms. Silva. Yes.
hang on, lieutenant tao, o-one second.
uh, what did he say about roy?
quiet, kept to himself -- you know, the usual homicidal-maniac routine.
you can stay and talk to the rest of them.
Yes, lieutenant?
right now?
bam!
Daniels called from the morgue.
Roy had both his femur bones crushed, plus cracked ribs and massive internal injuries to the chest.
we assumed that when the front wheel went over the upper body that the rear wheel went over the legs.
we've been running over all these dummies trying to figure out how roy managed to get two sets of injuries so close together.
Yeah, but the only way the tire patterns made any sense was that when the car ran over the body, it suddenly turned to the right.
but the alley is too narrow.
it would have hit the wall, and there's no paint marks anywhere.
please. My head is about to explode.
I assume you didn't bring us back down here just to catalog all the things you don't know.
there's a trail of oil right down the middle of the alley.
there's a lot of oil in this alley.
there is, but not all of it's fresh.
walk with me. Please.
this puddle of oil here, a few yards from the body, comes out of nowhere, which got me thinking
when the car ran over roy wilkinson, roy did a little damage to the car.
maybe broke the oil pan.
that's what I'm talking about.
this spot here tells me maybe the driver stopped, got out, said,"oh, my god. What have I done?"
then took off again. Walk with me.
so, now the car is leaking oil, and we can follow the oil trail like breadcrumbs.
walk with me.
shows us exactly where the car went.
walk with me.
walk with me.
walk with me.
the son of a bitch drove around the block
came back to finish the job.
while the vehicle ran over roy wilkinson a second time, we were able to follow the oil trail around the block, but, unfortunately, onto the westbound 10, and then it was impossible to isolate it.
well, at least now we know we have a murder.
and now we know we're looking for a car with a damaged oil pan.
and we've been checking with garages, tow companies, auto dealerships to see if anyone brought in a vehicle with this type of damage, but so far, nothing.
I tracked down most of the residents.
none of them admits to knowing much about roy.
any of them own a car?
well, there are two cars at the halfway house.
one belongs to this guy -- jim francis.
but supposedly he can't drive it, as he got his license suspended.
the other one is a datsun 210 -- couldn't go over a pothole, much less a person.
but I've got S. I.D. Checking out both vehicles for any traces of roy juice.
any word from roy's parole officer?
his voicemail says he's out of town. Comes back tomorrow.
anything useful come out of commander taylor's press release?
four calls saying it is a good day,
a guy called and said that he killed roy wilkinson, though he claimed he shot him, an insurance agency, a couple of ambulance-chasing lawyers, and 13 people reporting reckless drivers.
and a partridge in a pear tree.
okay, well, I think that we should follow up on all of them, please.
and in the meantime, I think we should focus our efforts on trying to find a car with a newly broken oil pan.
and, sergeant gabriel, just give me one minute.
and I think that we should introduce ourselves to the mayhans.
thank you.
hello. You've reached fritz howard.
leave a message, and I'll call you back.
I'm so sorry, fritzi.
my hit-and-run turned out to be a hit-and-run-around-the-block- and-then-hit-'em-again...
and run. Anyway, my entire day is shot.
so I was hoping that we could reschedule our nooner To an eighter...
or a niner.
sergeant gabriel mentioned that you were about to go see the mayhans.
I am.
let's go watch some tv.
Carly mayhan's killer was found dead in what police say was a hit-and-run after spending eight years in prison.
pick a channel -- any channel.
for davis mayhan, this is not the hollywood ending he would have envisioned, but perhaps it will provide closure.
I can't help what they put on the news.
but you can't ignore it.
are you telling me I can't talk to two possible suspects?
please. "Persons of interest" is the correct phrase.
and explain to me why the mayhans are more viable suspects than an entire halfway house full of recently released convicts.
because the mayhans have a motive.
listen, my first interview with a sus
a person of interest is the most important, - seeing how they react before they've had an opportunity -- - yes, thank you for the tutorial.
now allow me to give you one.
I, uh, I think I should go.
no. No, no, sergeant. Stay, please.
I think it's important for you to understand how to strike a balance between what chief johnson does and what i do.
because, you see, for all of her talents, your boss has a tin ear when it comes to politics and handling the media.
while chief pope seems to think of nothing else.
Yeah, because, sergeant, when the media see her face at the mayhans', it will become impossible for chief johnson to run an investigation on her terms.
well, thank you so much for the advice, but I would rather not give the mayhans time to consult an attorney or get their story straight.
did you really get the impression there that I was offering you advice?
sergeant, were you under that impression?
no, sir.
listen to me.
if you speak with the mayhans, you will do so in my office.
so you are ordering me to call the mayhans and invite them down here at their leisure?
Oh, no. No. I do not want you to call the mayhans.
Hey, laura. Andy flynn.
Yeah, I'm fine. Thank you. And you?
Oh, that's good.
so, I guess you heard about today's fortunate events.
well, that's why I called.
I know how much this means to you and davis, and I would love it if the two of you could stop down at parker center today so we can catch you up on all the details of the case.
cause you deserve to know. All right, great.
okay. See you soon.
anyone else you want me to lie to?
thank you, lieutenant. I know that was unpleasant.
but it's all for the best. - For who?
these people trust me, chief -- or they used to.
and I'm hoping to eliminate them as suspects.
let them bring a lawyer into this, it's just gonna drag on and on.
that asshole strangled a 22-year-old girl while having sex with her, and the court only gave him eight years.
now you want to drag these nice people through the mud over his death?
sometimes good people are capable of bad things.
there have to be consequences for that.
when the guy getting run over is roy wilkinson, then the consequences ought to be a ticker-tape parade.
we don't get to determine which victims are worthy of our attention, lieutenant.
and we can't pick and choose which parts of the justice system we want to uphold.
that's beautiful, chief.
so, if you'll excuse me, I think I need to throw up a little.
it's good to see you, andy. - You too, laura.
you're looking good. Lose weight?
Yeah, well, I went vegetarian, but don't tell my friends back in jersey that, okay?
uh, this is my boss, deputy chief brenda johnson.
hello.
and this is her boss, assistant chief will pope.
good to meet you. - How do you do?
thank you so much for coming in to speak with us today.
thank you. We know that you don't have to do this.
so, I assume you've heard a little bit about what happened this morning.
when the reporters started gathering on our lawn, we figured something was up.
we heard it was a hit-and-run.
there are facts that lead us to believe that roy wilkinson was murdered.
facts?
and if we don't get out ahead of this, we're afraid that the press might start jumping to conclusions.
Andy, what's she saying?
um, I-I'd like to know if you and your wife have had any contact whatsoever with the victim prior to his death.
a victim? - Mr. Wilkinson.
now he's the victim.
the last time I saw that monster was in a courtroom, and he got an eight-year sentence for murdering my daughter.
okay. Good.
now, just in order to dot our I's and cross our t's, we'd like to take a peek at your cars, if you don't mind.
you're kidding.
all right. It sounds like we're suspects.
Andy, do you think we're suspects?
look, laura, davis, I don't like this...
listen, the more careful we are with this now, the less damage the press can do to your reputations.
lieutenant flynn can come to your home in an unmarked car with a couple of our lab guys
no, that won't be necessary.
you can't look at our cars -- not without a search warrant.
Mr. Mayhan, our intent here is not to upset you.
too late.
we really just wanted to eliminate you and your wife as suspects.
you want to eliminate me as a suspect? - All right, honey.
was it a long, painful death?
was he brutally tortured before he died?
no. - Then it wasn't me.
well, that went real well.
Fritzi, I've spent the entire day smelling a boozy corpse and getting yelled at.
I'm not feeling very romantic.
neither am I.
how was your day?
well, if you can't fall asleep, you ought to be able to watch tv.
this is ridiculous. I'm taking you to the doctor. - No doctors!
they're just gonna tell me what I already know to stay at home, lie flat on my back, which I am trying to do.
well, I can't just stand here and watch you suffer.
W-what -- what are you doing?
what are those? - They work for me.
vicodin? Where did you get vicodin?
last year -- for my procedure. - I can't take your pills.
well, fine. Then I will call Leland and have him get you your own prescription.
put the phone down, please. - You are getting help
you're not helping me. - Yes, I am.
stop! Brenda. Sweetie.
I appreciate what you're trying to do, but giving vicodin to an alcoholic is not help.
Oh, right. I'm sorry. No pills.
I don't know why I keep forgetting that.
because you constantly dismiss addiction as a problem and we never talk about it ever.
okay, fine. Let's discuss it now.
now? Really? Seriously? In the middle of the night, - while I'm lying on the floor in pain? - Oh, sorry. Sorry.
well, what can I do?
get me your big bag of cookies, the remote to the television, and answer your phone.
answer your
deputy chief johnson's line.
may I ask who's calling? Just a minute.
detective daniels. - At this hour?
Hello, detective daniels. You're working late.
no reason to go home.
uh, I just got off the phone with that insurance investigator
Jim petersen of American omaha life.
life? Roy wilkinson had a life-insurance policy?
watch where you're going!
uh, on the low end -- $80, 000.
petersen is gonna fax over the full policy tomorrow morning, but he did tell me over the phone the beneficiary is A...
ex-wife or ex-girlfriend?
I'm not sure who she is.
but I can tell you where she works.
reporters have been calling here all day.
please. - Thank you.
I don't feel like talking to any of them.
do you know one reporter tried to ride the bus with me?
I mean, really.
were you and roy close, Ms. Simmons?
Oh, I don't know. I'm not here every day.
I-I volunteer a couple times a week, so I don't get a chance to get to know most of the men really well.
I had no idea roy was the one that did all those awful things to that mayhan girl.
he was kind to me.
I was helping him with his G. E.D.
I just... can't believe this.
did roy ever talk to you about money?
well, not really.
other than to complain he didn't have any.
he had enough to pay for a life-insurance policy, and he named you as the beneficiary.
a-a what?
life insurance. See?
your name -- right here.
why would he do that?
you didn't know he was leaving you this money?
no, not at all. Roy didn't say a word.
good lord.
even my husband didn't leave me anything like that.
Oh, I-I don't feel right taking this.
Roy must have cared for you very much.
well, I try to treat all of them like they were my own kids.
did you ever get the sense that roy was drinking again? - No.
anything out of the ordinary happen recently that might have upset him?
an argument? Old girlfriend?
there was something.
a couple of weeks ago, someone sent him flowers.
flowers?
but they didn't make him happy. He just threw them out right away.
do you know who sent them? - No.
or what florist they were from? - No.
but I took the flowers out of the trash and I brought them home.
the arrangement was beautiful.
still haven't found any cars in the neighborhood with damage done to the oil pan, and S. I.D. Says the two cars flynn found at the halfway house are clean.
and as for those flowers, I'm coming up empty on roy's secret admirer.
the flower business is nothing.
I mean, roy probably had one of those wacko pen pals while he was in prison
you know, lonely ladies who love from a safe distance.
Yeah, but if we could tie those flowers to the mayhans, then that might give us enough to get a warrant to search their vehicles.
baloney. I'm telling you -- the flowers are a waste of time.
but they're all we have to go on so far.
so check the visitors logs for the prison and halfway house, please.
and, lieutenant tao, I'd like you to get in touch with all the florists in the area.
I want to know who sent those flowers. - Don't bother.
and why would I not bother, lieutenant?
I sent the flowers.
please tell me why, lieutenant.
because it's the anniversary of carly's death, and I wanted roy never, ever to forget what he had done, because i wasn't going to.
so you sent him flowers?
and a card.
so, what did this card say?
what did the card say?
it said... "happy death day."
that is just enough for a decent defense attorney to make you a suspect in roy's murder.
chief, every year, this date hits me.
I mean, don't you have a case that you took a little more personally?
Carly and her parents deserve justice.
and whether you like it or not, roy wilkinson deserves the same.
you do understand that the right thing for me to do is to take you off this case?
please don't.
the, uh, parole officer's here.
thank you.
I was up north, trying to find another one of my parolees who decided not to call in.
jackass. So, what did I miss?
I was hoping that you could give me some inside information on roy wilkinson.
in your opinion, was he just another jackass?
so-so.
did you know that roy took out a life-insurance policy?
he left the money to a Ms. Simmons at the halfway house.
well, some ex-cons find jesus or mohammed.
Roy found an insurance agent.
or an insurance agent found roy.
did he have any enemies at the halfway house? - No.
any drinking buddies?
no, no, no. Roy always passed his drug tests.
he was a regular at A. A.Meetings.
what would cause someone who's been sober for a year to start drinking again?
you know, guilt, depression -- usual stuff.
I understand it was hard for roy to keep down a job.
Yeah. Yeah. Roy got fired a few times. - Why?
well, as roy tells it, laura mayhan would show up wherever he was working, pass out newspaper clippings, telling his employer and the customers how roy had murdered her daughter.
not a lot of businesses looking for that kind of P. R.
so Mrs. Mayhan was harassing him?
well, you know, you ask a judge -- no.
I mean, Mrs. Mayhan was not breaking any laws.
she could tell his employer any story she wanted.
did you ask her to stop?
you know, I've been doing this a long time, and here's the thing
not everyone stops when you tell them to.
Mrs. Mayhan...
I don't think she wanted to stop.
I understand. - No, no, no, no, no.
look, I'm being ordered to do this. - I don't care whose fault it is.
Hey, guys, over here. They're here.
is davis mayhan a suspect in the murder of roy wilkinson?
do you have any new evidence here?
Congratulations. I've never seen you handle the press better.
I didn't say a word to them. - Exactly.
now that they've seen you here, I'm gonna have to give them something.
I'll try and keep it vague, but I can tell you right now, lead on the story is "davis mayhan -- suspect in wilkinson murder."
well, commander, given your media skills,
I'm sure you'll find some handy way to spin this to our advantage.
so, spin, commander. Spin.
our attorney's already been on the phone with your chief pope, and he did not authorize this search warrant.
a judge authorized the search warrant.
and none of this would have been necessary if you had simply cooperated and if your wife hadn't lied.
what are you talking about?
two days ago, you both assured me that you hadn't seen roy wilkinson since his sentencing, when, in fact, your wife has been following him and harassing him.
that is ridiculous. Laura.
I wanted the world to know the truth about that man.
Roy thought that he could get a job and just go on with his life. - Oh, my god.
I couldn't let that happen.
you understand that whoever ran him over must have been following him.
how else would that person have found him in that alley?
I followed him in his car, but I did not kill him.
Roy didn't have a car, Mrs. Mayhan. - Of course he did.
are you sure you remember clearly?
maybe someone was giving him a ride.
our lawyer said not to talk to anybody.
don't talk to me like I'm 5 years old,Ms. Johnson.
I know what roy wilkinson looks like.
I remember every wrinkle on his face.
and I remember the crappy, blue oldsmobile toronado with the old blue plates that he's been driving.
and I remember the look in his eyes when he walked out of that courtroom.
you think I don't remember?
the truth is, I can't forget!
do you happen to remember where you were the night he was murdered?
that is enough.
do you remember the license - plate number on this blue car?
5-g-b-k-92. - No. No.
5-g-b-k-92! - Go back.
5-g-b-k-92! - Please. Sweetheart.
5-g-b-k-92! - Go upstairs.
5-g-b-k-92! - Please, don't. Sweetheart.
thanks for looking out for us, andy.
s. I.D. Said there's no damage, no sign of recent repair, no blood, no skin, no clothing from roy in any of their cars.
can I go back to being a suspect now?
5-g-b-k-9-2 does come back to a blue 1991 oldsmobile toronado.
it's registered to a guy named jerry nemec.
Yeah, he did seven years for robbery -- died three years ago.
now, the thing is, his registration is up to date, and his last known address --halfway house.
maybe jerry nemec left his car to roy?
no. Roy was in prison when jerry died.
they didn't live at the house at the same time.
besides, this car never showed up in flynn's search.
so where is it?
well, maybe one of roy's buddies at the halfway house took it off his hands after he died.
wait a minute. Wait a minute.
it says right here that jerry nemec was killed in a hit-and-run.
and it looks like he had a life-insurance policy, too.
I wonder if anyone else at the halfway house has a life-insurance policy.
thank you. Jim francis? - Yeah.
I'm brenda. - Okay.
I just have a few questions for you. - Okay.
now, how long ago were you released from prison?
about eight months ago.
and how long have you been in A. A.
about eight months... off and on.
are you drunk right now?
um, define "drunk.
do you own a car, Mr. Francis?
Yeah, but my license is suspended.
do you have any friends or family that chauffeur you around town?
me and my family aren't exactly close.
well, that explains why you haven't designated any of them as beneficiaries to your life-insurance policy.
what life-insurance policy?
that's not your signature?
no. - Thank you.
ladies. Thank you so much for coming in.
I would have come to you, but -- crazy day.
Any-old-how, I have copies for both of you of roy wilkinson's death certificate.
you'll need this to collect the life-insurance policy that roy left you, and karen will need one for the mortuary.
have you decided what kind of service you're gonna have yet? - Not yet.
is it going to be like the one you arranged for jerry nemec?
I'm sorry?
Oh, shoot. I forgot my glasses. I'll be right back.
okay.
we have nothing to worry about.
we didn't have anything to do with this.
so, sergeant, you see how useful it is to observe a person's first reaction to information.
ladies.
they were here all along.
sweetie, it only gets worse.
Oh, that's what I've heard.
you both are so incredible.
all the good you do for these men, it's not surprising that they'd want to do something nice in return.
well, a good deed is its own reward.
sure, but a good deed and a life-insurance policy is even better.
it's such a coincidence that both roy and jerry died the exact same way
drunk and hit by a car.
it's unfortunate that so many of these released criminals fall into the same destructive patterns of behavior.
hold that thought.
Oh, Mr. Francis. Thank you so much for waiting.
excuse me one second.
did you talk to him? - No. Why would I?
chief, you haven't read them their rights.
no. They haven't given me a reason to -- yet.
thank you for your patience.
I had to say goodbye to mr. Francis, who I just interviewed.
do you think that jim francis had something to do with roy's death?
Oh, I'm certain of it.
and it's strange, you know?
I mean, both he and roy have so much in common
ex-cons, no family, struggles with addiction, and they both had life-insurance policies.
the only difference is...
Jim francis doesn't have tire marks across his chest. - What?
well, don't you have to run them over first before you can collect the life-insurance money?
what is she saying, patty?
I'll answer that.
Roy wilkinson's life-insurance policy -- $80, 000.
beneficiary -- patricia simmons.
and roy had a second policy -- $150, 000.
beneficiary -- karen silva.
though no claim has been made -- yet.
Jerry nemec's policy -- $80, 000.
beneficiary -- patricia simmons.
and he had a second policy -- $150, 000.
beneficiary -- karen silva.
bill johnson, luther madison -- four men in the past five years, all living at your facility, all with life-insurance policies naming one or both of you as beneficiaries.
all from different companies, of course.
and it doesn't take an expert to see that all of these policies are written in the same hand.
no, no. You don't understand.
there are no families to pay for it, the state won't pay for it, and it is not cheap to give a man a decent funeral.
and we can't afford it on what we make. I-I'm a volunteer.
all I've got is my social security.
so, you identify the hardest cases...
and we make arrangements -- just in case.
well, you've become awfully good at identifying men who are 366 days away from being run over in an alley, because that is the exact way that all of these men died one year after you take out a policy.
coincidentally, one year is the same amount of time it takes for a life-insurance policy to vest.
now... I know you killed roy wilkinson.
my question is...
why does jim francis only have one policy?
why does only karen get to cash in on him?
it says so right here.
you greedy bitch! - Patty, shut up!
you greedy
not another word!
not another word! - You said we were done!
I said shut your mouth!
you both have the right to remain silent.
sergeant, could you...
anything you say can be used against you in a court of law.
you have the right to an attorney. - I'll get you!
if you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed to you.
I can afford an attorney!
you got to be kidding me. - Do you understand these rights?
Yes!
all right.
easy, easy! Ladies, that's enough!
come on! - Easy!
calm down. Sit down.
these men were criminals! They were drunks!
with free housing and three meals a day!
and we were waiting on them, getting older by the minute!
at the end of the week, I could hardly stand up!
and you're worried about roy wilkinson?
no. I'm worried about your retirement plan.
now, I'm gonna write one of you up for murder in the first degree and one of you as an accessory. Whose name goes where?
we got roy drunk.
he didn't want to go to the bar at first.
but you told him that one drink wouldn't hurt, and you gave him another and another until you could practically pour him into that car
Jerry nemec's car.
Roy passed out in the backseat, just like jerry.
just like all the others.
but a man who can't move is heavy.
so you put him on a blanket and you pulled him out of the car - and dragged him into the middle of that alley? - Yes.
you know, you're -- you're making it sound a lot worse than it was.
after we hit him, I just wanted to go home.
but you stopped to make sure he was dead. - Was he?
no. He was just moaning.
Karen pulled the car away.
I thought we were leaving. I was so relieved.
and then she drove around the block and she did it again!
Karen? Anything?
she's lying.
well...
that'll be up to a jury to decide which one of you is telling the truth.
I got to say, I don't like your odds.
I just told commander taylor to arrange a press conference for first thing in the morning
let the world know the mayhans had nothing to do with this.
uh, if you don't mind, I think lieutenant flynn should handle this one.
Yeah. Okay. - Thanks.
Hey, chief. - Yes?
thank you.
he's just kidding, vernon. Go ahead, try it. It's a fruit smoothie.
what kind would you like? We've got strawberry-banana.
got any berries? - Sure I've got berries.
I've got some raspberries. I've got some blueberries.
I've got some strawberries. Here you go.
watch this -- a little bit of juice. Not finished yet.
pop in some ice. Pop on the blade.
give it a quick spin... and just watch.
it takes about three
we'll check out these two addresses.
you get this one. Let me know what you find out.
go! Go!
I'm gonna chat these people up.
thank you.
Hey, folks...
look, I'm gonna ask for some patience here, all right?
we'll have people come out and speak to you.
missing Ruby Williams.
her name is Ruby Williams.
she's 8 years old.
her teacher said she went home for lunch around noon.
when she didn't show up, her mom called the school,
called all of Ruby's friends.
nobody had seen her, so at 12: 29, she called 911.
that was nearly 90 minutes ago.
responding officers checked the house,
started retracing Ruby's route from school. No sign of her.
at 1: 00, they called for additional units.
have we started a grid search of the neighborhood?
Yes, ma'am. - Stopping every car, knocking on every door.
we got uniforms and detectives that have rolled out from Hollywood, Wilshire, and Northeast Division to lend a hand.
and the FBI is here, too.
afternoon.
all these different divisions, there's no time for a turf war, sergeant.
everybody knows a child goes missing, priority homicide runs the show.
all right, then.
thank you.
gentlemen.
all right, it's just after 2: 00 p.m.
which means that Ruby Williams has been missing for two hours.
we'll start with the family, and we'll work our way out.
the FBI's here to give us whatever support we need.
we've got guys from the behavioral unit working up profiles on possible suspects.
look, if Ruby was snatched, what are the chances she's still alive come sundown?
we could get a call any minute saying someone found this little girl with a friend playing hooky or just plain lost.
under no circumstances do we use the word "homicide" in front of this family. Okay?
let's just keep our heads.
do the Williamses have a computer?
did we get permission to take it?
I did a background check on mom, dad, uncles. - No criminal record.
that's Ruby's older brother, Carlton.
he was supposed to walk her home, but he forgot.
says he was playing video games.
we may be talking to him again later.
thank you.
Mr. and Mrs. Williams, I'm deputy chief Johnson.
I think you've already met sergeant Gabriel.
we need to ask you a few questions about Ruby.
we've already talked to four different people.
and I hope we're the last.
I really do.
Mrs. Williams, I know you're going through an ordeal,
but I need you to help me.
will you please help me?
Mr. Williams, is Ruby allowed on the Internet?
I don't let either of my kids go online unless there's a school project,
and then I supervise.
her teachers love her.
she makes A's and B's.
only reason she's doing summer school is so that she can play the violin.
she's got a solo in the fall concert.
there she is, in the backyard, getting ready for the Easter Pageant.
thank you, grandma. We love the dress.
look at her.
she's a, um...
she's a beautiful little girl.
ode to joy.
has she had any problems with the other children in the neighborhood?
does she have a relationship with any of her grandparents?
watch. You ready?
my parents passed away before Ruby was born.
Randall's mother lives in Texas... - With my sister.
ruby sees her at Christmas time.
has Ruby been having any trouble with her older brother?
no.
how about you and your wife?
you two getting on?
Ruby's got a good home here.
she's a happy little girl.
and we always tell her, "If a stranger talks to you funny... you run."
run, run, run!
run, run, run.
we're gonna bring your little girl home.
I promise you that.
pick it up.
thank you.
does it look like a family thing?
my gut tells me no.
whatever resources you need, you got it.
look, well, I just don't think the mother's in any shape to go in front of the cameras right now.
listen, Brenda, assuming the worst, this can only help.
you know most child abductors don't see their victims as real people.
let's let this guy see what kind of pain he's causing.
all right.
this is my baby girl.
her name is Ruby Williams.
if anyone out there knows anything, if anyone saw her...
my baby!
Oh, my - I want my baby.
please.
I want my baby girl.
find my Ruby.
Oh, my lord, where's my baby?
uh, the, uh, LAPD is seeking information regarding the disappearance of 8-Year-Old Ruby Williams.
she was last seen walking home from school nearly three hours ago.
have we gotten anything useful from the neighborhood canvass?
I'm entering data from every field interview into the system as fast as I can get it.
let's see. - We have three different people saw a green truck by the school around noon.
I also have a blue van, a suspicious brown delivery vehicle, and an ice-cream truck.
green truck.
I've got one of those.
Yeah, we found the green truck and the Mexican gardeners that went with it,
and they didn't see anything.
we interviewed the ice-cream man, and he was gone by 11: 00.
Hey, Mike, you can cross off the brown delivery truck, too.
driver was uploading downtown between 12: 00 and 1: 30. Supervisor backs him up.
what about the blue van?
neighbor saw it parked on the street three days ago.
when she tried to get a better look, the driver took off.
she see his face?
white guy, kind of average-looking.
okay, so, white guy, kind of average-looking, blue van.
that doesn't give us much to go on.
hang on, chief.
I have a blue van.
guy here saw it twice this morning on this street.
Hey, chief. - Does silver count?
I got a white male in a silver/blue van around 11: 30 this morning.
what's the fastest way out of this neighborhood?
this is the route from Ruby's school to her house.
then I got two exits.
I can either go this way, - I'm on the 101 in 10 minutes - Or he heads north right into Griffith Park.
then I can be at the 134 or 5 freeways in 10 minutes.
okay, these streets are businesses.
maybe some of them have security cameras.
I can have my guys pull the footage.
look at every vehicle entering and exiting the neighborhood from 9: 00 a.m. to 2: 00 p.m. today.
lieutenant Provenza, please contact the city about whoever runs the traffic cameras.
maybe our blue van ran a red light.
lieutenant Fynn. - Chief!
detective Sanchez is with the k-9 unit.
dogs found something.
buzz, would you document this, please?
this is bad.
this is very bad.
hang on, hang on.
detective, didn't the search team cover this area already?
no, ma'am.
they checked the road from the girl's school, but this alley's a dead end.
the dogs led us here.
okay.
run, run, run.
ruby was doing exactly what her parents told her to do.
the driver must have come up on her as she was walking home from school.
maybe tried to talk her in the car, maybe a blitz attack.
either way, she ran, and this is where she was grabbed.
see how her sleeves are inside out?
she was pulled right out of her jacket.
I got your blue van.
at 10: 32 a.m. the van heads north on Hillhurst, passing this liquor store.
now, this film is from the same camera,
but 32 minutes later, he's going the other way.
here he comes again at 11: 39, going back the other way.
he was trolling. - Right.
now, we don't pick him up on this camera again.
instead, he shows up on the other side of the neighborhood, here,
six blocks from where you guys found the jacket.
this mini-mall camera picks him up at 12: 21: 23,
21 minutes after ruby left school.
next clean shot we get of him is here - 12: 21: 46.
he is leaving the neighborhood.
can't see the driver.
and here he is approaching this intersection at 12: 22: 02.
chief, I think I got a plate number.
12: 22: 08, our blue van cuts through the gas station at the red light.
Oh, he was in a hurry.
make this bigger.
okay. - 4DL×401.
give me three seconds.
let me print it out.
I got a VIN number and a name.
studio city address.
does Mr. Stimple have a rap sheet?
it's almost 4: 00.
guys, Roger Stimple is on parole for sexual battery.
okay.
have a parole officer meet us at his address.
got one on speed dial.
commander Taylor, please take over the command post.
detective Daniels, every bit of information comes through you. Thank you.
everyone else...
van looks empty, chief.
go ahead.
detective Sanchez, maybe he didn't hear us.
would you mind giving it a try?
get out!
are you Roger Stimple? - Yeah.
are you home alone, sir?
Hey, you guys can't go in there!
I'm afraid we can, sir.
as a condition of your parole,
you signed a consent form allowing searches of your person, property, and residence without a warrant.
go on.
kitchen's clear!
find it.
is that your blue van over there?
Yeah.
lieutenant.
why can't you leave me alone?
okay.
have you been home all day? - I was taking a nap.
can anyone verify that? - No.
did anyone borrow your van while you were sleeping? - This ain't fair.
answer the question! - No! You guys keep picking on me!
Mr. Stimple...
why can't you leave me alone?
I was minding my own business.
find it.
you don't have the right!
find it.
we get anything from the suspect's van?
nothing yet.
Mr. Stimple, your rights were read to you in the car.
what about the car under the tarp? Is that his, too?
1977 Mercury Cougar.
in less than mint condition.
there's no way he's keeping a clunker like that under canvas unless he's hiding something.
chief Johnson is having them tear it apart right now.
this is terrible.
I'm gonna do my best to get you through this as quickly as possible.
but first, is there anyone you'd like us to call?
your wife or your girlfriend?
I don't have a girlfriend.
what about your boss?
I was laid off three weeks ago.
Oh. That's too bad.
what were you doing?
I was landscaping.
mostly mow and blow.
what do you do now?
for work, I mean.
it's not that easy to get a job as a registered sex offender...
is it?
you're referring to your conviction for sexual battery.
some girl says I groped her...
and I get 2 1/2 years.
now I got to move again,
after you guys dragged me out of my house in handcuffs.
all because a dog barked at my van.
that must be very frustrating.
especially after you've already served your time in prison.
no matter what I do nobody trusts me.
Oh, my mother's gonna think this is my fault.
why is that?
when I got fired, she said she didn't want me to come home and not to bother her anymore.
she didn't even want to hear my side of the story.
blame Roger first.
that's her mantro.
or motto or whatever.
that's terrible.
that is so unfair.
when the rest of the world lets you down,
you should always be able to count on your mother.
she's supposed to love you no matter what.
and right now, there's another little girl that I'm sure would like to talk to her mother and can't.
might have heard about her on the news.
little girl went missing today.
I'm sure her mother is just desperate to hear her voice.
and I-I feel strongly that you can help us with this,
because you were driving around in the neighborhood where she went missing.
so if you know anything or you saw anything, I'd really like to know.
you know where I might find this little girl?
what little girl?
her name is Ruby Williams.
she's 8 years old.
she likes to play the violin.
and this afternoon, on her way home from school,
she was abducted.
she was in your van!
if something happened, I want to help you figure this out.
this is your chance to explain yourself.
I want a lawyer.
interview over.
I'll be right back.
Fritz, are we any closer to finding the girl?
hang on, Will.
didn't get anything from the van or the apartment?
no. No. He's lawyered up.
and I need something that ties him to Ruby Williams,
other than the testimony of a German shepherd.
don't look at me like that.
and how would you like me to look at you?
don't judge me.
I know that look.
well, you know, I know a little something about looks, too.
looking at you...
you know something about this little girl.
she's not that little.
Oh, really?
you see, everyone pretends kids.
don't want sex.
but they do.
you remember when you were a kid?
that's all you thought about.
there's nothing wrong with it.
it's biology.
and besides black girls are different.
is that right?
I mean, look at her.
black girls are way more sexually mature than white girls.
that's why they have kids so young.
you probably grew up swimming in black ass.
it's the way they walk.
shake...
shake...
shakin' their thing.
kill the feed, Buzz. - But the chief said no.
I said kill it!
do not leave this room!
why not?
because sergeant Gabriel is about to make a break in the case.
no, detective Danis, don't say anything to the family yet.
could be a hoax.
no, no. He wouldn't tell me.
he told sergeant Gabriel.
Yes, it is amazing.
uh, it doesn't matter who he told - We know.
send four black-and-whites to the Vermont canyon entrance by the pay phones at the rest area.
and, uh, send the k-9s.
thank you.
sergeant Gabriel, just to be clear,
Roger said that he left Ruby at the park.
he didn't say that she was dead.
is that right?
where are the phones? Where are the phones?!
damn it!
no!! No!!
no!! No!! No!!
no!!
in my office.
what did you do?
we found her, didn't we? Doesn't matter what I did.
nothing matters more.
Roger Stimple didn't look like that when I left the interview room.
so, I need to know, sergeant - Did you beat the suspect?
he deserved it.
that is not something that you get to decide on your own in an interview room with your fists.
are you seriously taking his side?
he killed her.
I got a confession.
you got an admission.
Roger told you where to find her.
not that he took her, not that he killed her.
and since you beat that admission out of him,
a jury won't be able to hear it anyway.
I promised that mother I was gonna bring her daughter home.
and that's exactly what I was trying to do.
you committed a criminal act.
when Roger gets a lawyer and tells him what you did,
and I. A. hears his complaint...
what about your future?
well, what do you - what do you want me to do now?
just go home.
you probably grew up swimming in black ass.
it's the way they walk.
shake...
shake...
shakin' their thing.
buzz, why did you stop the taping?
I thought when you, uh, left the room, the interview was over.
I have made myself perfectly clear it stays on as long as the suspect is in the room.
chief...
I killed the feed.
Why?
because...
I thought it was a good idea.
lieutenant, I want you to take charge of the prisoner.
make sure he's fed and gets medical attention if he needs it.
we don't have to book him or let him see his lawyer until he's arraigned,
which means we have less than 43 hours to tie him to Ruby's murder some other way.
I want the squad working,
but no one sees this tape or knows about what sergeant Gabriel has done.
have I made myself very clear?
Yes, ma'am.
Thanks.
Hey.
listen, your instincts about Roger's second car were right on.
we found a report on a '77 Mercury Cougar just like Roger's same blue paint on the bumper tied to two separate abductions five years ago,
before our guy went to jail on that sexual-battery charge.
two girls, African-American, ages 9 and 11.
they were never found.
so ruby wasn't his first victim.
well, last few years on parole must have been a cooling-off period.
but he just lost his job, and you said his family cut him off?
he's got some kind of a mother thing.
Yeah, just the kind of stress or events to set him off.
I should have never left Gabriel alone in that room.
I saw how mad he was.
I knew he was upset.
you told Pope about it yet?
no.
I'm still looking for a way out.
well, you tie Roger Stimple to these other missing girls...
it's okay. It's okay.
detective. You're working late.
uh, yes.
we found out that the landscaping firm where Roger Stimple used to work had a contract at the park where ruby was found.
couldn't you have called with this information, detective?
may I come in?
I'm not sure what David told you.
but he knows what he did was wrong.
well, that's a start.
please do not let this be the last thing he does as a police officer.
that may not be up to me.
as soon as the suspect shows up in court with his lawyer,
David's actions are gonna be front and center,
and the only way out of this is gonna be for me to lie.
is that what you want me to do?
you know, I wonder would you be here pleading David's case if y'all weren't dating? - But we are dating.
I don't want to talk about that.
I don't want to discuss it.
chief...
I know that you and commander Taylor have a complicated relationship.
but he cares a lot about David,
and sometimes...
chief...
we checked Stimple's home computer.
no sign of pornography - child or other.
30-year-old single man lives alone -- no pornography.
now, that's suspicious.
chief, one of the keys on Roger's key chain matches the padlock on the fence at the park.
boots from Roger's apartment match the prints we found in the park's bathroom.
that's probably where he raped her.
Roger's DNA is on file from previous busts.
it'll take a few days to get a match.
okay, what about the two other missing girls?
I'm checking their case files against Roger's Mercury and his whereabouts five years ago.
if our scumbag killed those girls,
he probably buried them in the park.
he knows the place inside and out.
then why didn't he bury Ruby?
he probably panicked when he heard our helicopters, left her in the ditch.
I'm telling you, chief - Those girls are out there.
Griffith Park is over 4, 000 acres.
we'd never find them without Roger's help.
so, we get him to tell us.
it's not that simple.
it worked with Ruby.
why not with these previous two girls?
get Gabriel, have him talk to him.
it's not...that...simple.
well, then, what am I missing?
excuse me, everyone.
I wanted to, uh, thank all of you personally for your hard work and dedication.
I know it's, uh...
it's just awful when an investigation ends the way this one did.
phd handled it quickly, professionally,
and you got a predator off the street.
thank you, chief Pope.
do we have a booking photo of the suspect? I'd like to release it to the press.
there's been a...slight complication.
what's that?
well, there's some question as to whether Roger's confession came after he invoked his right to counsel.
I don't understand that. If he invoked, he invoked.
if he confessed, he revoked, right?
uh, it fell somewhere in between.
and, unfortunately, we didn't get it on tape.
it doesn't hurt us too bad, but the thing is,
chief, we think this guy Roger's responsible for at least two other child abductions.
we don't want to taint other witnesses by releasing Roger's photo.
so we're going to keep his identity under wraps until we're done with the investigation.
okay. All right.
but I want this sorted out by the time he's arraigned.
so I can smear his face all over the news.
commander Taylor and I are pooling our resources.
okay. Good.
thank you, commander.
chief Johnson, you wanted to talk?
Gabriel let his emotions get the better of him. It's happened to all of us.
what Gabriel did was, uh...it was immature.
it wasn't just immature.
he acted in such a way that I now can't see how to close my case without permanently damaging his career.
and make no mistake, commander, I will close my case.
let's not forget - Gabriel's not the bad guy here.
there's a child killer in the mix whose admission I can't use.
too bad you can't get Roger to confess again.
believe me...
I've been trying to figure out how to do that all night.
you haven't booked the suspect yet?
no. He's still in isolation.
you know what, chief?
you have a lot to do still.
what with having to look after these other two missing girls?
why don't I take Roger off your hands?
have robbery homicide book him.
I don't see how that's gonna help me.
it will.
it will.
you wanted to see me, chief?
Yes.
lieutenant, what have we got on Roger's second car?
so far, nada. S.I.D. took some fibers, and they're looking for blood, hair,
anything that'll match one of the girls from five years ago.
it'll take weeks, if it works at all.
thank you.
chief...
I did a bad thing once.
I'm talking about the first time.
it was many years ago.
I was very young, like Gabriel, and my heart back when I had a heart - Was in the right place.
but I was stubborn, I was stupid, and...
I did something that I'm not proud of.
but...
people grow. People change.
and...
well... Look at me now.
excuse me, chief. We just got a call from lockup.
Roger wants to talk to you.
to me? - Yes.
commander Taylor's bringing him up right now.
I'm here to protect and serve.
you're not protecting me.
I wanted you out of there so you'd be safe.
what's the problem?
what happened?!
he did this to me!
he put me in the cell with other prisoners!
sometimes you forget how other prisoners treat people like Roger.
how did they find out who he was?
I don't know. Maybe some guard must have said something.
isn't there a rule against putting child molesters in general population?
whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute.
is that what you are, Roger?
are you a child molester?
I didn't - 'Cause before, you said you weren't.
you denied everything.
what's it gonna be?
are you a child molester or not?!
what are you, roger?!
do you like little girls, huh?!
what are you, roger?!
are you a child molester?!
he told them about me!
all right!
Mr. Stimple, do not answer that question!
commander, that's enough.
sorry. Sorry, chief.
please help me.
I can't do anything for you!
I can't even talk to you, because you've asked for a lawyer!
I want to talk.
okay. Fine.
let's get a doctor to take a look at you, and then we'll talk.
no. Not him.
can't we just keep this white?
let's go.
thank you, doctor.
Roger, just to be perfectly clear,
you are now saying that you want to talk to me.
in fact, you asked to talk.
I heard he had a little scuffle in the general population.
honestly, chief, there was no safe place to put this guy.
you don't have to talk to me without your attorney present.
you understand that, too?
okay.
again, just for the record,
you were just treated by a doctor for wounds.
you say you received from your fellow prisoners in your holding cell.
they attacked and beat you.
they're gonna kill me! They're gonna kill me!
I can't go back down there!
it's okay. It's okay, Roger.
I won't send you back.
I swear.
you're safe with me.
and I promise you, I will look into whoever did to you, okay?
okay?
let's you and I talk about Ruby.
because we looked for her by the pay phones, but she wasn't there.
I want to help y'all find her.
look, I made a mistake.
I was wrong not to talk to y'all before.
all I know is, I was driving through the park,
and there she was, just walking alone, by herself.
in the park? - Yeah.
and I used to work in that park.
it's not safe for a kid to walk around alone like that.
so I offered her a lift.
that's why your dogs smelled her in my van.
she wanted to call her folks.
so I-I took a service road that I know,
and I dropped her off by the phones.
I gave her some change to call home, and then I took off.
I'm telling you, that's what happened.
do you remember - Was she wearing her pink jacket?
Yeah.
Yeah, that sounds right.
she had her hands in her pockets.
and about what time was this?
I think - I think it was maybe around 12: 00.
and you never got out of your van?
no.
this explains a lot.
how she got in your van, why she was in that remote part of the park.
Yeah. Yeah. I was just trying to help.
and you're helping now.
you're helping a lot.
because, Roger...
you're probably the last person to see Ruby alive.
you see, we didn't find her by the pay phones, but we did find her.
she was dead, Roger.
Oh, man.
I can't believe it.
did you see anything suspicious in the park,
a car that didn't belong or someone walking around?
Yeah.
Yeah, well, you know, this could be nothing,
but there was this one dude I saw as we were heading to the phones.
he's a young guy, maybe 20, 25.
he was black or Hispanic.
you know, kind of Cuban black, you know what I mean?
he's a big guy.
Oh, man.
there are bad people out there.
you say you saw Ruby in the park around noon.
that's when her teachers saw her leaving school.
well...
the same time we got pictures of your van driving in her neighborhood.
I drive all around.
you say you didn't get out of your van, but we've got your footprints all over.
that doesn't mean anything!
and you say you saw Ruby in her pink jacket,
which we found in the alleyway where she was abducted.
now, it is high time that you tell me the truth.
the whole truth, Roger. Please.
let's you and I help each other.
otherwise there's nothing left to talk about.
all right. I'm gonna go find commander Taylor.
No! Don't send me back there!
what choice do I have?!
it's so hard.
you agreed to talk to me.
that's an important first step.
now let me help you make the next one.
because I know - I know what you're going through.
cause girls that age...
they are so beautiful.
other guys, they pretend that they don't feel the same way, but they do.
and the girls want it, too.
they just can't admit it...
because their mothers would pass judgment.
but I'm not passing judgment, Roger.
I just want to know what happened.
I was driving around, and I seen this girl I seen before.
you couldn't help but notice her.
and I don't go for girls who don't want me.
I've been on the other end of that thing when I was a kid.
no. She's into it.
all you were doing was giving her a ride.
exactly.
we were just driving around.
it was all just fun, you know?
I wasn't gonna do anything.
but she wanted it. So...
she was flirting with you.
you two fool around?
then right in the middle of it, she changed.
she got all mad at me.
said she was gonna tell the cops what we done.
which is so perfect - Just lead me on and then just flip like that.
and I got mad.
if something happened,
if there was an accident, you need to tell me.
cause the DNA that's gonna link you to Ruby,
and the D. A.'s gonna make you out to be a monster in a very public trial.
is that how you want your mother to see you?
is that how you want the world to see you?
I know that there's an explanation that only you have,
and I want to hear your side of the story.
but if I'm gonna help you, I need to hear it from you.
she just started screaming.
she was making so much noise.
I was just trying to keep her quiet.
I didn't want to hurt her.
but her neck...
it snapped...so easy.
then she got quiet.
I know how it sounds, but it was an accident.
you didn't mean it.
well, at least now we know.
thank you, Roger. I know that that was hard.
there's two more things I want to talk to you about.
Yeah.
chief Johnson's just about done with Roger Stimple.
she played him perfectly, chief.
got confessions on both Ruby and the two other girls.
that's excellent. Thank you.
Oh, and, uh...
let's not release his booking photo to the press.
use the DMV shot instead.
I don't want people to see a fat lip and feel sorry for this guy.
Yes, sir.
I'm hungry.
they'll be serving first meal in a couple hours.
you can eat in your cell.
wait.
what's gonna happen to me?
you'll be kept in isolation here until morning.
then you'll be handed over to county, which is under the supervision of the sheriff's department.
and after that...
I have no idea.
you don't understand.
if they put me back in general population...
they'll beat me.
they'll beat me.
no, Roger. I do understand.
what I'm trying to tell you is I don't care.
Yes, detective, what is it?
I, uh...just wanted to say thank you.
there's nothing to thank me for.
well, you got the confession.
I did.
and because this one will certainly be a capital case, Roger's lawyer will insist on a trial.
and David will have to testify about what he did.
I need to advise chief Pope of all this in the morning,
before Roger's lawyer breaks it to reporters.
and what will this mean for David?
well, we'll see.
won't we?
Gary DOESN'T LIE.
intimate BUT NOT SMALL -- CHECK.
character -- DOUBLE CHECK.
see? GARY DOESN'T LIE.
and THE BEST PART-- I'VE BEEN WORKING THE OWNER FOR MONTHS,
convincing HER TO SELL.
you're GETTING IN FIRST.
it " S NOT EVEN ON THE MARKET YET.
so, YOU LIKE?
the HOUSE? YES.
Gary? MAYBE NOT.
Doris: GOOD MORNING, EVERYONE.
Hey. HELLO, DORIS.
I WANT YOU TO MEET YOUR FIRST POTENTIAL BUYERS--FRITZ AND BRENDA.
thank YOU FOR COMING.
would ANYONE LIKE A FRESHLY BAKED COOKIE?
thank YOU.
you're welcome it's...?
I'm SURPRISED YOU WANT TO LEAVE.
Oh, I DON'T, REALLY.
no, I PUT IT ON THE MARKET LAST SUMMER,
and THEN I CHANGED MY MIND.
but THE HOUSE HAS GONE UP IN VALUE SO MUCH THAT EVERYBODY THINKS I SHOULD TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN.
more COFFEE?
no, I THINK THAT -- YES, PLEASE. OKAY.
you KNOW, WE RAISED THREE CHILDREN IN THIS HOUSE.
my HUSBAND, TOM -- HE PUT THOSE CABINETS IN HIMSELF.
Oh.
more COFFEE?
Yes, THANK YOU.
Hey.
we CAN RIP THOSE OUT -- NO PROBLEM.
more COMPANY!
deputy CHIEF JOHNSON.
I THOUGHT YOU SAID THIS PLACE WASN'T LISTED YET.
it's NOT SUPPOSED TO BE.
Yes, LIEUTENANT, WHAT IS IT?
someone AT MY OFFICE MUST HAVE NOTICED IT WAS BACK ON THE MARKET.
Why? WHAT HAPPENED?
he's HOW OLD?
Oh, FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE.
no, NO. I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.
thank YOU.
what IF WE WANTED TO MAKE AN OFFER?
what?
Hey, CHIEF. FAX FOR YOU.
"rules OF ESCROW"?
thank YOU!
so, THIS GUY WAS PUSHING AROUND SOME SICK OLD MAN IN A WHEELCHAIR NEAR HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD.
tao: A TOURIST FINALLY GAVE HIM A CELLPHONE TO CALL 911,
but BY THE TIME THE PARAMEDICS GOT THERE,
the GUY IN THE WHEELCHAIR WAS DEAD,
which MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE END OF IT, BUT
except OUR ELDERLY GENTLEMAN HERE CLAIMED HE MURDERED THE VICTIM.
10 TO 1, HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED.
my HEART!
help!
help!
and THEN HOLLYWOOD DIVISION PUSHED HIM OUR WAY [ BANG ] SO THAT THEY COULD ENJOY THEIR SUNDAY.
tao: THEY'RE JUST FOLLOWING THE RULES, CHIEF.
thing IS, OUR OLD GUY CLAIMS TO HAVE KILLED SIX OTHER PEOPLE THE SAME WAY.
and HOW DID HE DO THAT?
he WON'T SAY. HE WON'T TELL US HIS NAME, EITHER.
he DIDN'T HAVE ANY I. D. ON HIM,
and NEITHER DID THE DEAD GUY.
all RIGHT.
okay.
if I CAN DETERMINE THAT THIS MAN'S DELUSIONAL,
that HE BELONGS TO THE MENTAL EVALUATION UNIT,
then WE CAN ALL GO HOME AND SAVE ON OVERTIME.
in THE MEANTIME...
detectives DANIELS AND SANCHEZ,
please TAKE A PEEK AT MISSING PERSONS.
see IF ANYONE'S LOOKING FOR TWO NAMELESS OLD MEN.
lieutenant PROVENZA, PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT OUR VICTIM IS ON A GURNEY AT THE MORGUE.
and, LIEUTENANT TAO,
if YOU WOULDN'T MIND SENDING THIS FAX TO THE NUMBER ON THE COVER SHEET
it's SOME, UM, THINGY FOR MY REAL-ESTATE AGENT.
thank YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
good MORNING, SIR.
I'm DEPUTY CHIEF BRENDA LEIGH JOHNSON.
could YOU PLEASE TELL ME YOUR NAME?
how ABOUT THE NAME OF THE MAN WHO DIED?
I MURDERED HIM...
and THE OTHERS -- I KILLED THEM ALL.
and HOW DID YOU DO THAT?
poison.
you KNOW THAT YOU POISONED A TOTAL OF SEVEN PEOPLE,
but YOU DON'T KNOW YOUR NAME?
who SAYS I DON'T KNOW MY NAME?
a DEPUTY CHIEF, HUH? THAT'S PRETTY IMPRESSIVE.
there's -- WHAT? -- 12 OF YOU IN THE WHOLE DEPARTMENT?
sir, THERE ARE SEVERAL INCONSISTENCIES TO YOUR STORY.
I ACTUALLY REMEMBER THAT DETECTIVE PROVENZA GUY WHO PUT ME IN HERE.
he WAS A HIGHLY MOTIVATED YOUNG MAN.
bet YOUR SWEET ASS I WAS.
have YOU BEEN ARRESTED BEFORE?
I SPENT SOME TIME HERE WHEN I WAS YOUNGER.
what IS IT ABOUT MY STORY THAT'S INCONSISTENT?
well, YOU CLAIM YOU TRIED TO POISON SOMEONE,
and YET, YOU CALLED 911.
if YOU WERE REALLY TRYING TO MURDER SOMEONE,
why CALL FOR HELP?
well, UH, I WANTED TO SEE WHAT IT WAS LIKE DYING, YOU KNOW?
I DIDN'T WATCH THE OTHERS, BUT IT WENT ON TOO LONG,
and I CHICKENED OUT.
all RIGHT, UH, SIR,
I-I'm AFRAID THAT YOU MIGHT NOT BE COMPETENT TO SPEAK ON YOUR OWN BEHALF。
you're WORRIED ABOUT MY SANITY, HUH?
I HAVE A RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT.
anything I SAY CAN AND WILL BE USED AGAINST ME IN A COURT OF LAW. SIR.
I HAVE A RIGHT TO AN ATTORNEY.
if I CANNOT AFFORD ONE, ET CETERA, ET CETERA. SIR.
blah, BLAH, BLAH.
look, LET ME MAKE SOMETHING COMPLETELY CLEAR
I DO NOT WANT A LAWYER. UNDERSTOOD?
and IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO ASSEMBLE YOUR CASE,
let ME GIVE YOU A LITTLE HINT -- BERNARD KAPLAN.
is THAT YOUR NAME?
no, IT'S THE NAME OF YOUR DEAD JOHN DOE.
and I'LL TRADE YOU THE NAMES OF THE OTHER SIX PEOPLE I KILLED IF YOU'LL GIVE ME SOMETHING TO EAT.
all RIGHT.
names, PLEASE.
lieutenant PROVENZA, I'M ALMOST AFRAID TO ASK YOU THIS.
do YOU REMEMBER ANYTHING ABOUT THIS OLD MAN?
well, IF YOU TWISTED MY ARM, I'D SAY HE LOOKS FAMILIAR.
that's ABOUT IT.
chief, I RAN, UH, "RUMPLE'S" PRINTS THROUGH AFIS ALONG WITH BERNARD KAPLAN
no HITS ON EITHER MAN.
tao, WHAT'S A RUMPLESTILTSKIN?
[ chuckling ] IT'S A FAIRY TALE.
there's THIS OLD DWARF WHO WON'T TELL THE QUEEN HIS NAME,
and SHE HAS TO GUESS IT IN ORDER TO -- UH-HUH.
well, IF RUMPLESTILTSKIN HAS WANDERED AWAY FROM HOME,
it's BEEN LESS THAN 24 HOURS.
missing PERSONS HASN'T GENERATED A REPORT YET.
all RIGHT. SERGEANT GABRIEL,
let's HEAD OVER TO THE CORONER'S OFFICE,
see IF WE CAN GET SOME DEATH CERTIFICATES...
chief. I CAN GO TO THE MORGUE WITH YOU.
we'll SORT THIS OUT.
Oh, CHIEF, UM, THIS, UH, FAX...
didn't QUITE MAKE IT THROUGH.
um, I CALLED THE SERVICE GUY.
he's SUPPOSED TO BE HERE TOMORROW MORNING, 11: 00 A. M..
lieutenant TAO, THANK YOU.
I'll FIND ANOTHER FAX MACHINE ALONG THE WAY.
Gabriel CAME OFF SUSPENSION FRIDAY NIGHT.
why DON'T YOU GIVE HIM A CALL TO COME IN?
but WE'LL BE DONE WITH THIS BEFORE HE EVEN GETS HERE.
would YOU JUST DO IT, FLYNN?
God, YOU'RE A PAIN IN THE ASS.
let ME GUESS -- NATURAL CAUSES?
if WE WERE GUESSING,
I WOULDN'T BE CUTTING THE OLD GUY OPEN.
and PULLING OUT HIS INTESTINES.
I'd STILL BE AT BRUNCH WITH MY FRIENDS, HAVING A MIMOSA.
well, DR. MORALES, I'M SO SORRY TO INTERRUPT YOUR SUNDAY,
but IT'S IMPORTANT TO ESTABLISH THAT MR. KAPLAN HERE IS NOT A HOMICIDE VICTIM.
well, YOU BETTER WIPE OFF YOUR CRYSTAL BALL, HONEY,
because THIS GUESSING THING ISN'T WORKING FOR YOU.
Mr. KAPLAN WAS MURDERED?
you SEE THIS NASTY IRRITATION ALONG THE ESOPHAGUS?
some HEMORRHAGING, TOO -- THERE AND THERE,
and THE STOMACH WAS PRETTY TORN UP.
which MEANS VIOLENT VOMITING BEFORE DEATH.
even IN ADVANCE OF A TOX SCREEN, I'D SAY POISON.
all THE OFFICES WITH FAX MACHINES WERE CLOSED, CHIEF,
so NO LUCK SENDING THIS.
Oh, SHOOT.
but I DID DIG UP SIX DEATH CERTIFICATES,
one FOR EACH NAME THAT THE OLD MAN GAVE US.
now, THEY ALL DIED WITHIN THE LAST YEAR.
and GET THIS -- THEY ALL LIVED AT A PLACE CALLED THE SUMMER VIEW SENIOR LIVING CENTER.
now, WHILE THE CERTIFICATES INDICATE THAT THEY DIED OF NATURAL CAUSES,
they're ALL SIGNED BY THE SAME PHYSICIAN.
all RIGHT, MR. STILTSKIN, I'M NOT IGNORING YOU ANYMORE.
thank YOU SO MUCH!
just WORK.
what ARE YOU DOING HERE? YOU MEAN, IN MY OFFICE?
Oh, SORRY. UM...
you're HOLDING A DELUSIONAL OLD MAN IN AN INTERVIEW ROOM ON A SUNDAY AFTERNOON. -- YEAH, I KNOW THAT.
you're WRAPPING THAT UP, RIGHT,
sending EVERYBODY HOME UNTIL TOMORROW?
uh, NOT EXACTLY.
look, IT'S IRRITATING, I KNOW.
but AS IT TURNS OUT,
the DEAD GUY ACTUALLY WAS POISONED,
which MEANS THAT WE HAVE SIX MORE POTENTIAL VICTIMS.
so, GET THE DEATH CERTIFICATES.
that'll HAVE A CAUSE OF DEATH. WE DID THAT.
they ALL SUPPOSEDLY DIED OF NATURAL CAUSES.
but EACH DEATH CERTIFICATE WAS SIGNED BY THE SAME DOCTOR.
and WHEN A DOCTOR SIGNS OFF ON A DEATH CERTIFICATE... [ FAX MACHINE BEEPS ]
there's NO AUTOPSY.
Oh, MY GOD, BRENDA, TELL ME YOU DIDN'T JUST FAX ORDERS FOR THE EXHUMATION OF SIX BODIES.
okay, I DIDN'T.
I JUST FAXED THE OFFER.
I HAVE THE CONFIRMATION IN MY HAND.
well, NOTHING HAS COME THROUGH. CAN YOU JUST DO IT AGAIN?
Gary SAYS DORIS COULD GET ANOTHER OFFER ANY MINUTE.
and Gary doesn't lie.
it's THERE... IN THE MACHINE.
it's NOT.
all RIGHT. I'LL TRY AND SEND IT AGAIN LATER.
for HEAVEN'S SAKE!
Oh, CHIEF, IF YOU CAN BELIEVE IT,
six OF THE DEAD BODIES WERE CREMATED.
track DOWN THE ASHES.
any FAMILY MEMBERS GIVE YOU A PROBLEM, GET A WARRANT.
uh, LIEUTENANT TAO,
are WE SIGNED TO SEARCH THE NURSING HOME?
uh, NOT QUITE.
the JUDGE WANTS US TO SPECIFY THE ROOM NUMBERS WE WANT TO LOOK AT.
[ sighing ] OH.
Ohh!
we HAVE DETERMINED THAT THE SIX PEOPLE YOU NAMED...
are, IN FACT, DECEASED.
and THEY ALL LIVED AT THE SAME NURSING HOME PRIOR TO THEIR DEATHS.
congratulations, YOUNG LADY.
you're THAT MUCH CLOSER TO FINDING OUT WHO I AM.
and THAT MUCH CLOSER TO TREATING YOU LIKE A MURDERER,
which SEEMS TO BE WHAT YOU WANT!
now, I HAVE A WARRANT TO SEARCH MR. KAPLAN'S ROOM,
but I NEED A ROOM NUMBER.
might YOU HAVE A ROOM AT THIS FACILITY, AS WELL?
find OUT FOR YOURSELF.
say "CHEESE."
thank YOU.
Oh! OH! HI.
sergeant GABRIEL!
what ARE YOU DOING HERE?
I THOUGHT YOU WEREN'T COMING BACK UNTIL TOMORROW.
I-I SPOKE TO DANIELS,
and SHE SAID THE SQUAD WAS ON CALL,
and MY, UH, SUSPENSION WAS UP FRIDAY.
uh, I THINK THIS FAX CAME FOR YOU.
Oh, SHOOT!
I FAXED MYSELF.
chief, NURSING HOME AWAITS!
Oh, YES, THANK YOU.
um, I JUST NEED TO...SEND A FAX.
Oh, SERGEANT GABRIEL...
uh, IF YOU COULD, PLEASE BABYSIT THE SUSPECT WHILE I'M GONE.
thank YOU.
and THERE'S NO NEED TO BEAT INFORMATION OUT OF THIS OLD MAN.
he's BEEN CONFESSING ALL MORNING.
can YOU SIGN THESE, PLEASE?
what? I DID SIGN THEM.
I FAXED THEM TO YOU BEFORE I LEFT.
you FAXED ME YOUR WARRANT,
which IS HOW I KNEW WHERE TO FIND YOU.
Oh, FRITZ.
Oh, I'M SORRY.
look, I'M DEALING WITH A POTENTIAL SERIAL KILLER HERE.
okay? A VICIOUS MURDERER.
named RUMPLESTILTSKIN. YES, I KNOW.
here. JUST SIGN, PLEASE.
Oh, HI, THERE.
I'm NURSE STILES. YOU MUST BE HERE FOR A TOUR.
Oh, PARDON ME.
Hi, I'M NURSE TOWNSEND. HOW CAN I HELP?
is BERNARD KAPLAN A RESIDENT HERE?
Oh, MY. I REPORTED HIM MISSING TODAY.
is HE OKAY?
when DID YOU NOTICE HE WAS GONE?
early MORNING.
I WAS JUST FINISHING MY ROUNDS,
and I NOTICED MR. KAPLAN AND MR. BAXTER'S ROOMS WERE EMPTY.
is THIS MR. BAXTER?
Yes, IT IS -- DONALD BAXTER!
are HE AND MR. KAPLAN OKAY?
Mr. BAXTER'S ROOM NUMBER, PLEASE?
um, 309.
should I CALL THE MANAGER?
you CAN IF YOU LIKE.
wait! WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
you've GOT TO SIGN THE VISITORS' BOOK!
there's NOTHING IN KAPLAN'S ROOM, CHIEF.
[ sighing ] OH. THANK YOU.
it KILLS ME -- WHITE PEOPLE PAY ALL THIS MONEY TO STORE THEIR FAMILIES IN PLACES LIKE THIS.
we THROW SOME CARPET IN THE GARAGE, EVERYONE'S WELCOME.
looking AT THESE PICTURES,
doesn't LOOK LIKE MR. BAXTER HAS ANY FAMILY AT ALL.
there's ALL KINDS OF RESEARCH ON POISONS HERE, CHIEF.
Provenza: WAIT A MINUTE.
[ chuckling ] WAIT A MINUTE. I DO RECOGNIZE HIM.
Yeah, BAXTER -- DONALD BAXTER.
he HAD THE POLICE BEAT ON THE NEWSPAPER WHEN I WAS FIRST STARTING OUT, CHIEF.
how DID HE END UP HERE?
don't WORRY, LIEUTENANT. I'LL COME VISIT YOU.
excuse ME. WHO'S IN CHARGE HERE?
deputy CHIEF BRENDA LEIGH JOHNSON.
and YOU ARE...
judd WHALEY. I'M THE MANAGER.
I REALLY WOULD HAVE PREFERRED FOREWARNING ABOUT YOUR VISIT.
well, I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT,
but WHEN WE CALL AHEAD TO EXECUTE A SEARCH WARRANT,
we OFTEN FIND NO ONE'S HOME.
excuse ME. STEP BACK, PLEASE, SIR.
are MR. KAPLAN AND MR. BAXTER OKAY?
Mr. KAPLAN IS DEAD, AND MR. BAXTER IS IN CUSTODY.
why IS MR. BAXTER IN CUSTODY?
he CLAIMS TO HAVE POISONED MR. KAPLAN.
Oh, MY GOD.
but...
look, MR. BAXTER CAN BE TROUBLESOME,
a LITTLE PARANOID AT TIMES,
but HE AND MR. KAPLAN WERE FRIENDS.
paranoid -- IN WHAT WAY?
another ONE OF HIS FRIENDS PASSED AWAY SEVERAL MONTHS AGO,
and MR. BAXTER TOOK IT VERY HARD.
he SUFFERED WHAT OUR DOCTOR DIAGNOSED AS A PSYCHOTIC BREAK,
and SO, OCCASIONALLY, MR. BAXTER MAKES CRAZY ACCUSATIONS.
like WHAT?
silly THINGS, LIKE CLAIMING THAT THE STAFF IS SPYING ON HIM.
Dr. REISEN PUT HIM ON HALDOL, AN ANTIPSYCHOTIC,
and ALL INDICATIONS -- ARE THESE DR. REISEN'S SIGNATURES ON ALL THESE DEATH CERTIFICATES?
Yes, THEY ARE.
because IF THESE SIX PEOPLE WERE POISONED,
as MR. BAXTER CLAIMS,
and DR. REISEN MISDIAGNOSED THEM...
nobody IS POISONING PEOPLE HERE.
not MR. BAXTER AND CERTAINLY NO ONE ON SUMMER VIEW'S STAFF.
well, AS IT SO HAPPENS, MR. KAPLAN'S BODY DOES SHOW SIGNS OF POISONING.
what? OHH.
my GOD.
do YOU THINK MR. BAXTER WOULD POISON SOMEONE TO PROVE A POINT?
as CRAZY AS THAT MAY SOUND, WE CAN'T TAKE THE CHANCE.
I'm AFRAID WE CAN'T ALLOW MR. BAXTER TO RETURN TO SUMMER VIEW.
it's SIMPLY NOT SAFE FOR THE REST OF OUR SENIOR FAMILY.
also, AS A MATTER OF PROCEDURE,
I'm GONNA HAVE TO TREAT THESE SIX OTHER DEATHS AS MURDERS...
until I CAN DETERMINE OTHERWISE.
now, HOLD ON.
we RUN ONE OF THE FINEST FACILITIES IN THE COUNTRY.
check OUR RECORDS, OUR REPUTATION.
whatever IT TAKES, I'LL -- CHIEF...
you NEED TO SEE SOMETHING.
Mr. WHALEY, WE WILL CERTAINLY TAKE YOU UP ON YOUR OFFER.
that's MY HALDOL.
aren't YOU SUPPOSED TO BE TAKING THIS MEDICATION ON A DAILY BASIS, MR. BAXTER?
Yes.
it's SUPPOSED TO TREAT MY SO-CALLED "PARANOID DELUSIONS."
unfortunately, IT DOESN'T WORK SO WELL,
since I NEVER TOOK IT.
so NOW YOU'RE READY TO BELIEVE MAYBE I REALLY DID MURDER THOSE SEVEN PEOPLE?
I'm STARTING TO, YES.
then I???
Brenda: MR. BAXTER, YOU UNDERSTAND...
it's A LITTLE HARD TO TAKE YOU SERIOUSLY,
especially SINCE YOU 'VE QUIT YOUR MEDS AND ARE MOST LIKELY SUFFERING FROM PSYCHOTIC DELUSIONS.
the NURSING HOME WAS USING THOSE PILLS TO SHUT ME UP.
because I KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.
I KNOW THEY'RE KILLING PEOPLE.
well, YOU DO SOUND A LITTLE PARANOID.
Yeah, YOU SEE HOW THAT WORKS?
I KNOW SOMETHING BAD IS GOING ON,
so THEY SAY I'M DELUSIONAL AND GIVE ME PILLS, DRUGS,
to TRY AND KEEP ME QUIET,
knowing THAT, IF I STOP TAKING THE DRUGS AND SPEAK UP,
I'm GONNA SOUND CRAZY.
why DID YOU FIRST TELL US...
that IT WAS YOU WHO KILLED THOSE PEOPLE?
it WAS THE ONLY WAY I COULD GET YOU TO LISTEN TO ME.
and IF IT COMES DOWN TO IT,
I'd RATHER GO TO PRISON THAN BACK TO THAT HOME.
well, YOU COULD HAVE JUST FILED A COMPLAINT.
I DID FILE A COMPLAINT, WITH THE POLICE,
but NO ONE TOOK ME SERIOUSLY...
until NOW.
I'm SORRY I WASN'T MORE HELPFUL BEFORE,
but I NEEDED TO KNOW I COULD TRUST YOU...
and I NEEDED YOU TO BELIEVE THAT MURDERS HAD BEEN COMMITTED.
murders FOR WHICH YOU ARE STILL THE MOST LIKELY SUSPECT.
Bernie WAS MY LAST BEST FRIEND. WHY WOULD I KILL HIM?
well, IF I'M TO BELIEVE THE MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS,
it's BECAUSE YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR MIND!
and WHEN I ASKED YOU WHY YOU POISONED MR. KAPLAN,
you SAID IT WAS TO WATCH HIM DIE.
now, THAT'S JUST CRAZY.
Exactly!
all RIGHT, FOR THE SAKE OF ARGUMENT,
what MOTIVE DROVE SUMMER VIEW TO MURDER SEVEN OF ITS PAYING CUSTOMERS?
the CUSTOMERS WEREN'T PAYING ENOUGH.
look INTO IT.
you'll FIND THAT EACH OF THE VICTIMS HAD RECENTLY RUN OUT OF MONEY AND HAD TO GO ON MEDICAID.
that's A MASSIVE LOSS OF INCOME FOR SUMMER VIEW.
doesn't SOUND INSANE TO ME.
in YOUR ROOM, WE FOUND RESEARCH MATERIALS ON VARIOUS POISONS.
I WAS TRYING TO FIND OUT HOW THEY WERE KILLING US OFF.
I KNEW IT WAS POISON BECAUSE SO MANY OF MY FRIENDS GOT SICK SO SUDDENLY.
[ crying ] BUT WHEN POOR BERNIE CAME DOWN WITH THE SAME SYMP,
I JUST WANTED TO TRY TO GET HIM SOME HELP.
why DIDN'T YOU CALL FAMILY,
someone TO TAKE YOU TO A HOSPITAL?
I DON'T HAVE ANY FAMILY LEFT,
and YOU CAN FORGET GOING TO DR. REISEN OR NURSE TOWNSEND FOR HELP.
for ALL I KNOW, ONE OF THEM WAS RESPONSIBLE.
got THE TOX SCREEN BACK FOR BERNIE KAPLAN POSITIVE FOR ARSENIC.
arsenic.
chief, WE PICKED UP NURSE TOWNSEND.
she's ON HER WAY.
we're STILL LOOKING INTO THIS DR. REISEN.
and, UH, COMMANDER TAYLOR SAYS HE'S CHECKING INTO BAXTER'S CLAIM THAT HE FILED A COMPLAINT.
thank YOU, SERGEANT.
uh, THESE FILES THE MANAGER GAVE US,
I LOOKED INTO SUMMER VIEW'S FINANCIAL RECORDS
for ALL SEVEN VICTIMS, AND BAXTER WAS RIGHT,
they WERE ALL ON MEDICAID.
only PROBLEM...
there ARE CURRENTLY 11 OTHER RESIDENTS AT SUMMER VIEW,
who ARE ALSO ON MEDICAID, SEVERAL OF THEM FOR YEARS.
so MUCH FOR MR. BAXTER'S THEORY.
anything ELSE?
summer VIEW SEEMS LIKE A REALLY EFFICIENT PLACE WINNER OF SEVERAL AWARDS, COMMENDATIONS,
and MONTHLY BONUSES -- ALL BASED ON OCCUPANCY.
so IT'S HARD TO SEE WHY THEY'D BE KILLING OFF THEIR CUSTOMERS.
okay, CREMATED REMAINS FOR FIVE OF THE VICS.
what HAPPENED TO NUMBER SIX?
uh, FAMILY LOST HIM IN A MOVE.
uh, THIS IS, UH, JOYCE ROBINSON.
her DAUGHTER SAID SHE NEVER GOT AROUND TO GETTING A PROPER URN.
Marilyn ROBERTS -- HER NIECE SAYS...
Yeah, I GET THE PICTURE. YEAH.
someone's FAMILY CARED.
um, WANT TO LOOK A LITTLE MORE CLOSELY AT THE NAME, CHIEF?
they PUT MOM'S ASHES IN THE DOG'S URN.
it's NOT FUNNY, FLYNN.
pope: HOW NICE TO SEE EVERYBODY SPENDING TIME TOGETHER OFF THE CLOCK.
this IS SOME KIND OF TEAM MORALE-BUILDING EXERCISE, RIGHT?
actually, CHIEF POPE, WE MAY BE LOOKING AT SOME OVERTIME HERE,
and I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.
no. NO OVERTIME -- PERIOD.
and AS FOR YOUR SUSPECT,
either CHARGE HIM OR SEND HIM HOME.
I'm NOT PAYING FOR HIM TO SPEND THE NIGHT HERE.
I'm ALSO NOT SHELLING OUT THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS FOR YOU TO EXHUME SIX DEAD BODIES BASED ON THE WORD OF A SENILE OLD MAN.
okay? SO FORGET ABOUT THAT.
good NIGHT. BYE. LET'S GO.
uh, WAIT.
just -- JUST A SECOND. UM, JUST ONE SECOND.
how ABOUT THIS?
um, SIGN OFF ON OUR OVERTIME TODAY,
and I PROMISE, I WON'T DIG UP ANY OF THOSE OTHER DEAD BODIES.
we'll JUST FIND SOME OTHER WAY TO SOLVE THIS THING.
deal.
but I'M HOLDING YOU TO THAT.
Oh, AND, HERE, I ALMOST FORGOT
a, UH, COUNTEROFFER ON A HOUSE THAT YOU ARE APPARENTLY BIDDING ON WAS FAXED TO MY OFFICE.
looks LIKE IT'S MORE THAN THE ASKING PRICE.
what?
um, [CLEARS THROAT] CHIEF...
what WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO DO WITH THESE?
I MEAN, THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY A DEAD END.
uh, LIEUTENANT TAO, ISN'T ARSENIC A HEAVY METAL?
which MEANS IT WOULD SHOW UP ON A CHEM SCREEN OF CREMATED REMAINS.
right, SO, WANT TO HAVE THOSE ASHES ANALYZED ASAP, PLEASE?
thank YOU.
[ knock ON DOOR ] CHIEF, GOT A MINUTE?
seems THE OLD GUY DID TRY REACHING OUT TO US FOR HELP.
thank YOU.
after RECEIVING NUMEROUS LETTERS TO THE DEPARTMENT, "DETECTIVE GORDON WAS DISPATCHED TO QUESTION THE COMPLAINANT, DONALD BAXTER.
according TO THAT REPORT,
gordon FOUND BAXTER UNCOOPERATIVE.
in FACT, THE OLD GUY WAS MORE INTERESTED...
in ASKING QUESTIONS THAN ANSWERING THEM.
it SEEMED LIKE A CRANK,
so DETECTIVE GORDON DUMPED HIS COMPLAINT IN THE ROUND FILE.
I'm SORRY -- THE ROUND FILE?
the TRASH.
but YOU KNOW WHAT, CHIEF?
we GET THIS KIND OF STUFF ALL THE TIME.
it's HARD ENOUGH STAYING ON TOP OF THE CRIMES WE FIND,
much LESS THE ONES PEOPLE MAKE UP.
and THE GUY WAS -- COME ON, YOU KNOW.
I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED.
Mr. BAXTER'S OLD AND DIFFICULT,
and BECAUSE OF THAT, HE WAS DISMISSED OUT OF HAND.
and I KNOW THAT THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED,
because THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I'VE BEEN TRYING TO DO TO HIM MYSELF.
but WE DIDN'T JUST DUMP A COMPLAINT IN THE TRASH...
a FEW MORE HUMAN BEINGS WENT WITH IT.
thank YOU.
were YOU CLOSE WITH MR. KAPLAN?
I AM CLOSE WITH ALL OUR RESIDENTS.
Oh, SO YOU REMEMBER THESE FOLKS, THEN?
Oh, MRS. ROBERTS -- SHE WAS A SWEET LADY.
she ALWAYS TALKED ABOUT HER LATE HUSBAND.
she USED TO SAY HE HAD A GREAT HEAD OF HAIR.
and THEN SHE STARTED TO FORGET SHE'D EVER BEEN MARRIED.
Oh, POOR MR. HEPFNER AFTER HIS DAUGHTER PASSED AWAY,
he JUST SAT AND STARED OUT THE WINDOW FOR A WHOLE YEAR...
before HE DIED.
you CARED ABOUT THEM.
Yes. IT'S MY JOB.
getting OLD IS SCARY.
some OF OUR RESIDENTS LOSE EVERYTHING...
family, FRIENDS, MONEY.
they RUN OUT OF LIFE BEFORE THEY RUN OUT OF TIME.
did ANY OF THESE PEOPLE SEEM SICK BEFORE THEY DIED? YES.
they ALL HAD THE SAME DISEASE -- IT'S CALLED "OLD AGE."
listen, PEOPLE DIE AT SUMMER VIEW.
we DON'T JUMP TO MURDER AS THE CAUSE.
who HAS ACCESS TO THEIR DRUGS?
the NURSING STAFF.
and THE DOCTOR, DR. REISEN.
do YOU KNOW WHERE HE IS? I'VE TRIED TO CONTACT HIM.
on VACATION -- HAWAII FOR A WEEK, WITH HIS WIFE.
Oh, YOU DON'T THINK DR. REISEN HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE DAY-TO-DAY CARE.
I SUPERVISED THE MEDS.
any CHANCE DRUGS GET MIXED UP?
we DO OUR VERY BEST, MS. JOHNSON,
with PATIENTS WHO FORGET TO TAKE THEIR MEDS,
misplace THEIR PILLS,
and SOMETIMES, SIMPLY WON'T COOPERATE.
do YOU THINK THAT MR. BAXTER POISONED MR. KAPLAN HIMSELF?
I REALLY DON'T KNOW.
whatever MR. BAXTER'S CLAIMING,
this NONSENSE THAT WE HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT,
that's NOT TRUE.
Mr. BAXTER BURNED HIS BRIDGES WITH SUMMER VIEW AND WITH HIS SON.
wait. WAIT.
his SON? YES.
would YOU LIKE TO HAVE A SEAT, SIR?
is MY FATHER DEAD?
no. HE'S NOT.
thank GOD.
so, WHAT, UH, IS HE ABSENT WITHOUT LEAVE AGAIN?
you NEED ME TO TAKE HIM BACK TO THE NURSING HOME?
actually, UH, SUMMER VIEW IS REFUSING TO TAKE YOUR FATHER BACK.
he's MADE SOME ACCUSATIONS TOWARDS THE STAFF.
this ISN'T ABOUT THE POISONING THING AGAIN, IS IT?
listen, IT'S NOTHING. DAD USED TO BE A REPORTER.
he's JUST DESPERATE FOR ONE MORE STORY, THAT'S ALL.
well, SOME OF THAT STORY SEEMS TO BE TRUE.
several PEOPLE AT SUMMER VIEW MAY HAVE BEEN SLIPPED SOME ARSENIC.
Seriously?
wait.
is -- IS DAD UNDER ARREST?
should HE BE? OF COURSE NOT.
look, HE'S A NUISANCE, THAT'S ALL.
he SPENT HIS ENTIRE CAREER QUESTIONING PEOPLE.
it's WHO HE IS.
are YOU CLOSE TO YOUR FATHER?
Why?
you're NOT, LIKE, SUGGESTING...
I SHOULD TAKE HIM HOME WITH ME, ARE YOU?
cause I KNOW IT SOUNDS COLD,
but MY LIFE IS JUST NOT CONDUCIVE TO DEALING WITH HIS BAGGAGE RIGHT NOW.
and WHEN IS IT CONDUCIVE?
excuse ME?
uh, ACCORDING TO SUMMER VIEW'S VISITORS' LOG,
which EVERYONE HAS TO SIGN IN TO ENTER,
you HAVEN'T DROPPED BY TO SEE YOUR FATHER IN OVER A YEAR.
and I WAS WONDERING IF THERE WAS SOME REASON.
what's IT TO YOU WHEN I SEE MY DAD?
I GOT THREE KIDS, AN EX-WIFE IN REHAB.
and THE LAST TIME I HAD THE OLD GUY OVER FOR DINNER,
he GOT MY 11-YEAR-OLD SON TO HELP HIM GET ONLINE TO FIND PICTURES OF PEOPLE WHO DIED FROM CYANIDE.
I DON'T NEED THAT KIND OF CRAP IN MY LIFE.
look, I WAS ONLY ASKING ABOUT YOUR FATHER...
to SEE IF YOU HAD SOME REASON TO BE AFRAID OF HIM.
afraid OF HIM? I HARDLY KNOW HIM, OKAY?
he SPENT MY ENTIRE CHILDHOOD...
chasing AFTER NEWSPAPER HEADLINES.
look, I GOT BY WITHOUT HIM THEN,
he CAN GET BY WITHOUT ME NOW.
speaking OF WHICH, I NEED TO GO.
I LEFT MY KIDS WITH THE BABYSITTER.
excuse ME.
your DAD'S HERE.
would YOU LIKE TO POP YOUR HEAD IN AND SAY "HELLO BEFORE YOU HEAD OUT?
maybe SOME OTHER TIME.
I GUESS MR. BAXTER WAS RIGHT.
he HAS NO FAMILY.
so, WHAT DO YOU DO IF YOU RUN OUT OF FRIENDS AND FAMILY AND MONEY?
it's A REASON TO KILL YOURSELF,
but IS IT A MOTIVE FOR MURDER?
look, CHIEF, UM...
unless YOU'RE GONNA BOOK THE MISERABLE OLD GUY,
I COULD TAKE HIM HOME WITH ME FOR THE NIGHT.
it's NO PROBLEM.
your CALL.
treat HIM LIKE A WITNESS...
but WATCH HIM LIKE A KILLER.
Gary: LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING,
I KNOW WOMEN LIKE DORIS.
she's EMOTIONALLY ATTACHED TO THE HOUSE.
so A SITUATION LIKE THIS,
you HAVE GOT TO DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN...
to SELL HER ON WHO YOU ARE.
so, IN THE LETTER THAT YOU WRITE WITH THE NEW OFFER,
you DON'T JUST RAISE THE PRICE A LITTLE BIT,
you TALK ABOUT THE TWO OF YOU AS A COUPLE.
how YOU SEE YOURSELVES LIVING IN THE HOUSE,
raising A FAMILY JUST LIKE SHE DID.
even THROW IN A PICTURE OF THE CAT.
and YOU OFFER TO HELP HER OUT ON THE TERMS.
she WILL JUMP ALL OVER IT, ALL RIGHT? TRUST ME.
Gary DOESN'T LIE.
we HELP HER OUT ON TERMS?
all RIGHT, LOOK, ESCROW'S ONE TO TWO MONTHS.
today's THE 6th.
you GIVE OUR OLD LADY A 20-DAY ESCROW.
end OF THE MONTH,
Doris HAS YOUR MONEY IN HER HOT LITTLE HANDS.
so DO YOU, RIGHT?
excuse ME?
you MOVE ANOTHER HOUSE,
especially FROM SOMEONE YOU LISTED,
and YOU GET CASH COMING AND GOING.
isn't THAT RIGHT?
maybe YOU HAD TO MOVE ANOTHER UNIT OR TWO BY THE END OF THE MONTH TO HIT YOUR BONUS.
is THAT IT?
that's GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH ANYTHING.
please.
Gary DOESN'T LIE.
Mm-hmm.
what? WHAT? WHERE YOU GOING?
it's NOT JUST THE VISITOR'S LOG.
it's THE DATES. IT'S THE DATES!
detective SANCHEZ,
may I SEE THOSE DEATH CERTIFICATES AGAIN, PLEASE?
thank YOU.
detective DANIELS, WERE YOU ABLE TO...
track DOWN THAT MANAGER AT SUMMER VIEW?
judd WHALEY -- HE'S ON HIS WAY.
good.
uh, LIEUTENANT FLYNN,
if YOU WOULDN'T MIND ASKING LIEUTENANT PROVENZA TO BRING THE SUSPECT BACK IN, PLEASE?
I'm ON IT, CHIEF.
has ANYONE SEEN LIEUTENANT -- TAO!
got THE CHEM RESULTS ON THOSE ASHES.
you're GONNA WANT TO TAKE A LOOK.
I WILL. THANK YOU. UM...
uh, DETECTIVE DANIELS, IF YOU WOULD, PLEASE,
bring SERGEANT GABRIEL UP TO SPEED ON SUMMER VIEW'S FINANCIALS.
thank YOU.
sleep WITH ONE EYE OPEN?
well, HE HAD ME UP ALL HOURS PLAYING YAHTZEE.
he's A FREAK FOR THE DICE.
Really? WHO WON?
what's WHALEY DOING HERE?!
just HAVE A FEW THINGS TO CLEAR UP, MR. BAXTER.
he'll ACCUSE ME OF EVERYTHING.
well, WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT, WON'T WE?
buzz, WOULD YOU PLEASE GIVE ME ONE OF YOUR LEGAL PADS?
thank YOU.
you KEEP INSISTING THERE'S A STORY HERE.
you're THE REPORTER.
listen TO WHAT MR. WHALEY HAS TO SAY,
write IT ALL DOWN,
and I'LL BE BACK TO TALK WITH YOU IN A MINUTE.
you READY, SERGEANT?
Yes, MA'AM, COMPLETELY READY.
Mr. WHALEY, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING IN.
certainly.
why DON'T YOU HAVE A SEAT?
the REASON I CALLED YOU IN IS,
I THINK IT WOULD BE IN EVERYONE'S BEST INTEREST...
if YOU WERE TO ALLOW MR. BAXTER...
back IN YOUR FACILITY FOR A WHILE.
are YOU SERIOUS?
what's SHE DOING? I CAN'T GO BACK THERE.
shh, shh! WE NEED TO HEAR THIS.
he REALLY HAS NOWHERE ELSE TO GO.
his FAMILY.
look, MS. JOHNSON, THERE ARE OTHER PATIENTS IN OUR CARE,
and IF MR. BAXTER WAS POISONING PEOPLE,
well, FOR ONE THING, IT'S A LIABILITY NIGHTMARE.
I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND YOUR CONCERN, MR. WHALEY,
especially SINCE SUMMER VIEW HAS QUITE A REPUTATION TO UPHOLD.
uh, TWO AWARDS FOR STATE EXCELLENCE,
three COMMENDATIONS BY THE CALIFORNIA SENIORS ASSOCIATION,
and EIGHT BONUSES,
based UPON YOUR OCCUPANCY WITHIN THE LAST YEAR ALONE.
all THIS WHILE COPING WITH THE EXTREME LONELINESS OF YOUR RESIDENTS,
which IS SOMETHING THAT MR. BAXTER HAD IN COMMON WITH THE SEVEN PEOPLE HE CLAIMS WERE MURDERED.
and I'VE NOTICED THAT NOT ONLY...
had OUR VICTIMS RUN OUT OF MONEY,
but THEY HAD ALSO, ACCORDING TO YOUR VISITORS' LOG,
exhausted THEIR SUPPLY OF GUESTS.
no ONE CAME TO SEE THEM ANYMORE.
that HAPPENS TO MANY MORE OF OUR RESIDENTS...
than ONE MIGHT LIKE TO BELIEVE.
well, HERE'S SOMETHING A BIT MORE UNUSUAL.
this IS ALL THAT'S LEFT OF FIVE OF OUR VICTIMS.
the SIXTH WAS LOST IN A FAMILY MOVE.
this IS A TESTAMENT TO HOW BADLY THEY WERE IGNORED.
odd, ISN'T IT?
people WHO HAVE GUESTS, LIVE. PEOPLE WHO DON'T, DIE.
well, THE EFFECT OF OUR EMOTIONS ON THE PHYSICAL BODY...
is STILL A MYSTERIOUS PROCESS,
but BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
some OF THESE PEOPLE LIKELY PASSED AWAY FROM DEPRESSION.
I BELIEVE NOT, MR. WHALEY,
but THEN, I HAVE AN ADVANTAGE OVER YOU,
because YOU CAN TEST FOR ARSENIC IN CREMATED REMAINS.
and WHAT WE HAVE HERE ARE FIVE CONTAINERS OF POISONOUS ASH.
my GOD.
Oh, BUT YOU WOULD NEVER ASK US TO TAKE MR. BAXTER BACK IF YOU THOUGHT HE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS.
no, I WOULDN'T.
but I DON'T THINK MR. BAXTER IS RESPONSIBLE,
because HE DOESN'T HAVE A MOTIVE.
what HE DOES HAVE IS A LAWSUIT,
because HE BROUGHT THESE POISONINGS...
to SUMMER VIEW'S ATTENTION,
and YOU ATTEMPTED TO DRUG HIM WITH ANTIPSYCHOTICS.
well, THAT WAS DR. REISEN'S DIAGNOSIS.
I DON'T PRESCRIBE DRUGS.
I'm NOT A DOCTOR. I'M A MANAGER.
the MANAGER WHO COLLECTED THE BONUSES BASED ON HOW MANY ROOMS ARE OCCUPIED DURING THE FIRST FIVE DAYS OF EVERY MONTH.
can YOU, UH, SEE A PATTERN DEVELOPING HERE, SIR?
you SEE, IT'S REALLY -- IT'S REALLY QUITE REMARKABLE,
because ALL OF YOUR ABANDONED MEDICAID PATIENTS...
they ALL DIED IN THE FOURTH WEEK OF EVERY MONTH,
giving YOU TIME TO REBOOK THEIR ROOMS WITH FULL-PAYING CLIENTS FROM YOUR WAITING LIST.
why WOULD I DO THAT?
well, ACCORDING TO YOUR FILES,
every MONTH THAT SUMMER VIEW HAS AN OCCUPANCY RATE BELOW 3%, YOU COLLECT A $2, 500 BONUS
you HAD EIGHT OF THEM LAST YEAR.
now, I'M THINKING THAT MAYBE YOU GOT LUCKY.
and SOMEONE DIED NATURALLY ON YOUR TIMETABLE.
but, STILL, YOU POISONED 7 PEOPLE FOR UNDER $20, 000.
sergeant.
Mr. WHALEY, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT.
anything YOU SAY... SHE'S GOOD.
Yeah, SHE'S ALL RIGHT, I GUESS.
I taught her most of this.
...one WILL BE APPOINTED TO YOU BY THE STATE.
have YOU HEARD AND UNDERSTOOD THESE RIGHTS?
you're MISREPRESENTING EVERYTHING.
we HAVE WARRANTS OUT AS WE SPEAK TO SEARCH YOUR HOME,
your OFFICE, AND YOUR CAR.
all I HAVE TO DO IS FIND THE ARSENIC.
just ONE LITTLE PACKAGE OF ROUGH ON RATS,
and IT'S GONNA LOOK VERY BAD FOR YOU.
Mr. WHALEY, ABSENT YOUR EXPLANATION,
I'm GONNA HAVE TO ARREST YOU ON SEVEN COUNTS OF MURDER IN THE FIRST DEGREE,
which IS A VERY DIFFERENT CRIME FROM MERCY KILLINGS.
you KNOW, NURSE TOWNSEND TOLD US...
that THESE PEOPLE WERE SICK AND UNHAPPY.
it MUST HAVE BEEN VERY HARD TO WATCH THEM SUFFER DAY AFTER DAY.
they WANTED TO DIE.
there WAS NO QUALITY OF LIFE FOR THESE PEOPLE, MS. JOHNSON.
three OF THEM HAD A FORM OF DEMENTIA AND NOWHERE TO GO.
Mr. KAPLAN, WELL, HE WAS SUFFERING FROM CONGESTIVE HEART DISEASE.
and IF YOU'LL JUST -- JUSTJUST PAUSE AND REFLECT FOR A MOMENT.
by CONTROLLING THE SCHEDULEOF WHEN THESE POOR PEOPLE EXPIRED.
which IS ALL I EVER DID,
making SURE THEY DIDN'T DIE BETWEEN THE 1st AND THE 5th,
which WOULD HAVE BEEN POINTLESS
by MANAGING THEIR DEATHS,
I WAS ABLE TO MAXIMIZE THE VALUE OF THEIR PASSING
by CREATING ROOM FOR PEOPLE
who COULD BETTER BENEFIT FROM OUR SERVICE.
people WITH LARGER BANK ACCOUNTS.
look, I'M NOT THE PERSON WHO TURNED OLD AGE INTO A BUSINESS.
and HONESTLY, THE BONUSES I RECEIVED, AS YOU POINTED OUT, WERE VERY SMALL.
Mr. WHALEY...
you POISONED THESE PEOPLE.
well, THAT'S ONE WAY OF LOOKING AT IT, YES,
but, REALLY, WHO CARES?
their FAMILIES OBVIOUSLY DON'T.
these OLD PEOPLE WERE DEAD ALREADY.
all I DID WAS MAKE IT OFFICIAL.
and BY DOING IT MY WAY, EVERYBODY GOT WHAT THEY WANTED.
so I REPEAT -- WHO CARES?
unfortunately FOR YOU -- MR. BAXTER.
well, YOU HAVE A POINT THERE.
so, HOW ABOUT THIS?
I WILL REFRAIN FROM EXPEDITING THE TERMINAL PHASE OF ANY FUTURE RESIDENT'S STAY AT SUMMER VIEW,
and MR. BAXTER CAN COME BACK AND STAY WITH US...
for AS LONG AS HE LIKES.
and IF HE AGREES NOT TO SUE,
we'll GIVE HIM A YEAR FOR FREE.
while THAT IS A VERY GENEROUS OFFER, MR. WHALEY,
if I DIDN'T ARREST YOU ON SEVEN COUNTS OF MURDER IN THE FIRST DEGREE, WHICH IS WHAT I'M DOING RIGHT NOW.
what?
but WHY ARE YOU...
I-I JUST EXPLAINED TO YOU.
now, NOW, HOLD ON ONE MOMENT!
I THOUGHT YOU SAID MERCY KILLING AND FIRST-DEGREE MURDER...
were VERY DIFFERENT CRIMES!
they ARE, BUT THE PUNISHMENT FOR BOTH IS EXACTLY THE SAME.
are YOU ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT PUTTING ME IN PRISON?
don't WORRY.
it's NOT THAT DIFFERENT FROM SUMMER VIEW, REALLY.
you HAVE TO SIGN IN TO VISIT PEOPLE,
friends AND RELATIVES TEND TO FORGET YOU EXIST,
and AT SOME POINT, THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA MIGHT JUST PUT YOU OUT OF YOUR MISERY.
well, I CERTAINLY DON'T DESERVE THIS.
you're RIGHT, MR. WHALEY.
unfortunately...
did YOU WRITE IT ALL DOWN?
well, YOU GAVE ME AN EXCLUSIVE.
I DIDN'T KNOW IF I HAD ANOTHER STORY IN ME.
at LEAST, THIS WAY,
people WILL READ BERNIE'S OBITUARY, WON'T THEY?
Provenza: WELL, I'M SURE THEY WILL, MR. BAXTER.
would YOU LIKE US TO ARRANGE SOMEPLACE FOR YOU TO GO,
or WOULD YOU LIKE MONEY FOR A HOTEL ROOM?
well, REALLY, I WAS HOPING I COULD GO BACK TO SUMMER VIEW.
what?
well, I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT BEING POISONED ANYMORE,
and IT REALLY IS THE ONLY HOME I HAVE, MS. JOHNSON.
Oh.
and THE SUMMER VIEW SENIOR LIVING CORPORATION...
just MIGHT FEEL SOME SENSE OF FINANCIAL OBLIGATION.
I COULD WIND UP LIVING THERE SCOT-FREE TILL THE DAY I DIE.
Ah, THE GOLDEN YEARS.
rent-free FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE I SOLD MY HOUSE.
house.
Oh, MY. I ALMOST FORGOT.
um, LIEUTENANT PROVENZA, COULD YOU PLEASE...
I've GOT IT COVERED, CHIEF. THANK YOU.
here WE GO, MR. BAXTER.
and GOOD LUCK, MR. BAXTER.
you TOO, YOUNG LADY. THANK YOU.
you KNOW, IF THERE'D BEEN A GREAT-LOOKING BROAD...
Doris: GARY EVANS DROPPED YOUR LETTER BY EARLIER.
I CAN'T BEGIN TO TELL YOU HOW MUCH IT MEANS TO ME KNOWING YOU FEEL SO STRONGLY ABOUT THE HOUSE.
it's ALL LIES.
I'm SORRY?
in OUR LETTER, WE MADE STUFF UP...
because WE WANTED YOU TO LIKE US.
we TOOK ADVANTAGE OF YOU,
and IT WAS A TERRIBLE, DREADFUL THING TO DO,
and I'M SO, SO SORRY.
but GARY EVANS,
Gary LIES.
so YOU'RE... PULLING YOUR OFFER?
it JUST WOULDN'T FEEL RIGHT.
I'd BE WORRIED ABOUT HOW YOU WERE SPENDING YOUR RETIREMENT.
so, YES, I'M -- I'M -- I'M PULLING THE OFFER.
Oh, BUT THAT'S WONDERFUL, DEAR!
Why?
I HATE TO SAY THIS,
but I WAS NEVER GONNA SELL THIS HOUSE IN A MILLION YEARS!
excuse ME?
no, THAT'S WHY I UPPED THE PRICE.
I DIDN'T THINK I'D GET AN OFFER SO SOON IN THIS MARKET.
I-I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
well, WHEN MY HUSBAND DIED... I WAS A LITTLE LONELY.
it's SO DIFFICULT TO MEET PEOPLE IN LOS ANGELES.
I TRIED GOING TO A. A. FOR A LITTLE WHILE,
but IT TURNS OUT YOU HAVE TO QUIT DRINKING COMPLETELY,
which SEEMED EXTREME.
so YOU PUT YOUR HOUSE ON THE MARKET...
...to HAVE A LITTLE COMPANY, YES.
nothing?
it's exactly as I described ito you.
Gary doesn't lie.
intimate but not small -- check.
character -- double check.
see?
Gary doesn't lie.
and the best part -
I've been working the owner for months, convincing her to sell.
you're getting in first.
it's not even on the market yeT.
so, you like?
the house? Yes.
Gary? Maybe not.
good morning, everyone.
Hey.
Hello, Doris.
I want you to meet your first potential buyers -- Fritz and Brenda.
thank you for coming.
would anyone like a freshly baked cookie?
thank you.
you're welcome.
it's so homey here.
I'm surprised you want to leave.
Oh, I don't, really.
no, I put it on the market last summer, and then I changed my mind.
but the house has gone up in value so much that everybody thinks I should take the money and run.
more coffee?
no, I think that -- - yes, please.
okay.
you know, we raised three children in this house.
my husband, Tom -- he put those cabinets in himself.
more coffee?
Yes, thank you.
Hey.
we can rip those out -- no problem.
goodness!
more company!
deputy chief johnson.
I thought you said this place wasn't listed yet.
it's not supposed to be.
Yes, lieutenant, what is it?
someone at my office must have noticed it was back on the market.
Why? What happened?
he's how old?
Oh, for heaven's sake.
no, no. I'll be right there.
thank you.
what if we wanted to make an offer?
what?
Hey, chief.
fax for you.
"rules of escrow"?
thank you!
so, this guy was pushing around some sick old man in a wheelchair near hollywood boulevard.
a tourist finally gave him a cellphone to call 911, but by the time the paramedics got there, the guy in the wheelchair was dead, which might have been the end of it, but -
except our elderly gentleman here claimed he murdered the victim.
10 to 1, here's what happened.
my heart!
help! Help!
and then hollywood division pushed him our way
so that they could enjoy their sunday.
they're just following the rules, chief.
thing is, our old guy claims to have killed six other people the same way.
and how did he do that?
he won't say.
he won't tell us his name, either.
he didn't have any I. D.On him, and neither did the dead guy.
all right.
okay.
if I can determine that this man's delusional, that he belongs to the mental evaluation unit, then we can all go home and save on overtime.
in the meantime...
detectives Daniels and Sanchez, please take a peek at missing persons.
see if anyone's looking for two nameless old men.
lieutenant Provenza, please make sure that our victim is on a gurney at the morgue.
and, lieutenant tao, if you wouldn't mind sending this fax to the number on the cover sheet
it's some, um, thingy for my real-estate agent.
thank you.
thank you so much.
good morning, sir.
I'm deputy chief Brenda Leigh Johnson.
could you please tell me your name?
how about the name of the man who died?
I murdered him...and the others
I killed them all.
and how did you do that?
poison.
you know that you poisoned a total of seven people, but you don't know your name?
who says I don't know my name?
a deputy chief, huh?
that's pretty impressive.
there's -- what?
12 of you in the whole department?
sir, there are several inconsistencies to your story.
I actually remember that detective Provenza guy who put me in here.
he was a highly motivated young man.
bet your sweet ass I was.
have you been arrested before?
I spent some time here when I was younger.
what is it about my story that's inconsistent?
well, you claim you tried to poison someone, and yet, you called 911.
if you were really trying to murder someone, why call for help?
well, uh, I wanted to see what it was like -- dying, you know?
I didn't watch the others, but it went on too long, and I chickened out.
all right, uh, sir, I-I'm afraid that you might not be competent to speak on your own behalf -
you're worried about my sanity, huh?
I have a right to remain silent.
anything I say can and will be used against me in a court of law. - Sir.
I have a right to an attorney.
if I cannot afford one, et cetera, et cetera. - Sir.
blah, blah, blah.
look, let me make something completely clear -
I do not want a lawyer.
understood?
and if you don't know how to assemble your case, let me give you a little hint -- Bernard Kaplan.
is that your name?
no, it's the name of your dead john doe.
and I'll trade you the names of the other six people I killed if you'll give me something to eat.
names, please.
lieutenant Provenza, I'm almost afraid to ask you this -
do you remember anything about this old man?
well, if you twisted my arm, I'd say he looks familiar.
that's about it.
chief, I ran, uh,"rumple's" prints through afis along with Bernard Kaplan -
no hits on either man.
tao, what's a rumplestiltskin?
it's a fairy tale.
there's this old dwarf who won't tell the queen his name, and she has to guess it in order to -- uh
well, if rumplestiltskin has wandered away from home, it's been less than 24 hours.
missing persons hasn't generated a report yet.
all right. Sergeant Gabriel, let's head over to the coroner's office, see if we can get some death certificates...
chief.
I can go to the morgue with you.
we'll sort this out.
Oh, chief, um, this, uh, fax didn't quite make it through.
um, I called the service guy.
he's supposed to be here tomorrow morning, 11: 00 A. M.
lieutenant Tao, thank you.
I'll find another fax machine along the way.
Gabriel came off suspension friday night.
why don't you give him a call to come in?
but we'll be done with this before he even gets here.
would you just do it, Flynn?
God, you're a pain in the ass.
let me guess -- natural causes?
if we were guessing,
I wouldn't be cutting the old guy open and pulling out his intestines.
I'd still be at brunch...
with my friends, having a mimosa.
well, dr. Morales, I'm so sorry to interrupt your sunday, but it's important to establish that mr. Kaplan here is not a homicide victim.
well, you better wipe off your crystal ball, honey, because this guessing thing isn't working for you.
Mr. Kaplan was murdered?
you see this nasty irritation along the esophagus?
some hemorrhaging, too -- there and there, and the stomach was pretty torn up.
which means...
violent vomiting before death.
even in advance of a tox screen, I'd say poison.
all the offices with fax machines were closed, chief, so no luck sending this.
Oh, shoot.
but I did dig up six death certificates, one for each name that the old man gave us.
now, they all died within the last year.
and get this
they all lived at a place called the summer view senior living center.
now, while the certificates indicate that they died of natural causes, they're all signed by the same physician.
all right, mr. Stiltskin, I'm not ignoring you anymore.
thank you so much.
what are you doing here?
you mean, in my office?
Oh, sorry. Um...
you're holding a delusional old man in an interview room on a sunday afternoon -
Yeah, I know that.
you're wrapping that up, right, sending everybody home until tomorrow?
uh, not exactly.
look, it's irritating, I know.
but as it turns out, the dead guy actually was poisoned, which means that we have six more potential victims.
so, get the death certificates.
that'll have a cause of death.
we did that.
they all supposedly died of natural causes.
but each death certificate was signed by the same doctor.
and when a doctor signs off on a death certificate...
there's no autopsy.
Oh, my god, Brenda, tell me you didn't just fax orders for the exhumation of six bodies.
okay, I didn'T.
I just faxed the offer.
I have the confirmation in my hand.
well, nothing has come through.
can you just do it again?
Gary says doris could get another offer any minute.
and gary doesn't lie.
it's there...
in the machine.
it's not.
all right. I'll try and send it again later.
for heaven's sake!
Oh, chief, if you can believe it, six of the dead bodies were cremated.
track down the ashes.
any family members give you a problem, get a warrant.
uh, lieutenant Tao, are we signed to search the nursing home?
uh, not quite.
the judge wants us to specify the room numbers we want to look at.
we have determined that the six people you named are, in fact, deceased.
and they all lived at the same nursing home prior to their deaths.
congratulations, young lady.
you're that much closer to finding out who I am.
and that much closer to treating you like a murderer, which seems to be what you want!
now, I have a warrant to search mr. Kaplan's room, but I need a room number.
might you have a room at this facility, as well?
find out for yourself.
say "cheese."
thank you.
Oh! Hi. - Sergeant Gabriel!
what are you doing here?
I thought you weren't coming back until tomorrow.
I-I spoke to Daniels, and she said the squad was on call, and my, uh, suspension was up friday.
uh, I think this fax came for you.
Oh, shoot!
I faxed myself.
chief, nursing home awaits!
Oh, yes, thank you.
um, I just need to...send a fax.
Oh, sergeant Gabriel...
uh, if you could, please babysit the suspect while I'm gone.
thank you.
and there's no need to beat information out of this old man.
he's been confessing all morning.
SUMMERVIEW Senior Living
can you sign these, please?
what?
I did sign them.
I faxed them to you before I left.
you faxed me your warrant, which is how I knew where to find you.
Oh, Fritz.
Oh, I'm sorry.
look, I'm dealing with a potential serial killer here. Okay?
a vicious murderer.
named rumplestiltskin.
Yes, I know.
here. Just sign, please.
Oh, hi, there.
I'm nurse Stiles.
you must be here for a tour.
Oh, pardon me.
Hi, I'm nurse townsend. How can I help?
is Bernard Kaplan a resident here?
Oh, my. I reported him missing today.
is he okay?
when did you notice he was gone? - Early morning.
I was just finishing my rounds, and I noticed mr. Kaplan and mr. Baxter's rooms were empty.
is this mr. Baxter?
Yes, it is -- Donald Baxter!
are he and mr. Kaplan okay?
Mr. Baxter's room number, please?
um, 309.
should I call the manager?
you can if you like.
wait! Wait, wait, wait.
you've got to sign the visitors' book!
there's nothing in Kaplan's room, chief.
Oh. Thank you.
it kills me
white people pay all this money to store their families in places like this.
we throw some carpet in the garage, everyone's welcome.
looking at these pictures, doesn't look like mr. Baxter has any family at all.
there's all kinds of research on poisons here, chief.
wait a minute.
wait a minute.
I do recognize him.
Yeah, Baxter -- Donald Baxter.
he had the police beat on the newspaper when I was first starting out, chief.
how did he end up here?
don't worry, lieutenant.
I'll come visit you.
excuse me.
who's in charge here?
deputy chief Brenda Leigh Johnson.
and you are...
judd Whaley. I'm the manager.
I really would have preferred forewarning about your visit.
well, I'm sorry about that, but when we call ahead to execute a search warrant, we often find no one's home.
excuse me. Step back, please, sir.
are mr. Kaplan and mr. Baxter okay?
Mr. Kaplan is dead, and mr. Baxter is in custody.
why is mr. Baxter in custody?
he claims to have poisoned mr. Kaplan.
Oh, my god.
but...
look, mr. Baxter can be troublesome, a little paranoid at times, but he and mr. Kaplan were friends.
paranoid -- in what way?
another one of his friends passed away several months ago, and mr. Baxter took it very hard.
he suffered what our doctor diagnosed as a psychotic break, and so, occasionally, mr. Baxter makes crazy accusations.
like what?
silly things, like claiming that the staff is spying on him.
Dr. Reisen put him on haldol, an antipsychotic, and all indications -
are these dr. Reisen's signatures on all these death certificates?
Yes, they are.
because if these six people were poisoned, as mr. Baxter claims, and dr. Reisen misdiagnosed them...
nobody is poisoning people here -
not mr. Baxter and certainly no one on summer view's staff.
well, as it so happens, mr. Kaplan's body does show signs of poisoning.
what?
my god.
do you think mr. Baxter would poison someone to prove a point?
as crazy as that may sound, we can't take the chance.
I'm afraid we can't allow mr. Baxter to return to summer view.
it's simply not safe for the rest of our senior family.
also, as a matter of procedure,
I'm gonna have to treat these six other deaths as murders until I can determine otherwise.
now, hold on.
we run one of the finest facilities in the country.
check our records, our reputation.
whatever it takes, I'll
chief...
you need to see something.
Mr. Whaley, we will certainly take you up on your offer.
that's my haldol.
aren't you supposed to be taking this medication on a daily basis, mr. Baxter?
Yes.
it's supposed to treat my so-called "paranoid delusions."
unfortunately, it doesn't work so well, since I never took it.
so now you're ready to believe maybe I really did murder those seven people?
I'm starting to, yes.
then I'd like to withdraw my confession.
Mr. Baxter, you understand it's a little hard to take you seriously, especially since you've quit your meds and are most likely suffering from psychotic delusions.
the nursing home was using those pills to shut me up because I know what's going on.
I know they're killing people.
well, you do sound a little paranoid.
Yeah, you see how that works?
I know something bad is going on, so they say I'm delusional and give me pills, drugs, to try and keep me quiet, knowing that, if I stop taking the drugs and speak up, I'm gonna sound crazy.
why did you first tell us that it was you who killed those people?
it was the only way I could get you to listen to me.
and if it comes down to it,
I'd rather go to prison than back to that home.
well, you could have just filed a complaint.
I did file a complaint, with the police, but no one took me seriously...until now.
I'm sorry I wasn't more helpful before, but I needed to know I could trust you...
and I needed you to believe that murders had been committed.
murders for which you are still the most likely suspect.
Bernie was my last best friend.
why would I kill him?
well, if I'm to believe the medical professionals, it's because you're out of your mind!
and when I asked you why you poisoned mr. Kaplan, you said it was to watch him die.
now, that's just crazy.
Exactly!
all right, for the sake of argument, what motive drove summer view to murder seven of its paying customers?
the customers weren't paying enough.
look into it.
you'll find that each of the victims had recently run out of money and had to go on medicaid.
that's a massive loss of income for summer view.
doesn't sound insane to me.
in your room, we found research materials on various poisons.
I was trying to find out how they were killing us off.
I knew it was poison because so many of my friends got sick so suddenly.
but when poor bernie came down with the same symp -
I just wanted to try to get him some help.
why didn't you call family, someone to take you to a hospital?
I don't have any family left, and you can forget going to dr. Reisen or nurse Townsend for help.
for all I know, one of them was responsible.
got the tox screen back for Bernie Kaplan
positive for arsenic.
arsenic.
chief, we picked up nurse Townsend.
she's on her way.
we're still looking into this dr. Reisen.
and, uh, commander taylor says he's checking into Baxter's claim that he filed a complaint.
thank you, sergeant.
uh, these files the manager gave us -
I looked into summer view's financial records for all seven victims, and baxter was right - they were all on medicaid.
only problem -- there are currently 11 other residents at summer view who are also on medicaid, several of them for years.
so much for mr. Baxter's theory.
anything else?
summer view seems like a really efficient place -
winner of several awards, commendations, and monthly bonuses
all based on occupancy.
so it's hard to see why they'd be killing off their customers.
okay, cremated remains for five of the vics.
what happened to number six?
uh, family lost him in a move.
uh, this is, uh, Joyce Robinson.
her daughter said she never got around to getting a proper urn.
Marilyn Roberts -- her niece says
Yeah, I get the picture.
someone's family cared.
um, want to look a little more closely at the name, chief?
scrappy.
they put mom's ashes in the dog's urn.
it's not funny, Flynn.
how nice to see everybody spending time together off the clock.
this is some kind of team morale-building exercise, right?
actually, chief Pope, we may be looking at some overtime here, and I'm sorry about that.
no. No overtime -- period.
and as for your suspect, either charge him or send him home.
I'm not paying for him to spend the night here.
I'm also not shelling out thousands of dollars for you to exhume six dead bodies based on the word of a senile old man. Okay?
so forget about that.
good night. Bye.
let's go.
uh, wait.
just -- just a second.
um, just one second.
how about this?
um, sign off on our overtime today, and I promise, I won't dig up any of those other dead bodies.
we'll just find some other way to solve this thing.
deal.
but I'm holding you to that.
Oh, and, here, I almost forgot -
a, uh, counteroffer on a house that you are apparently bidding on was faxed to my office.
looks like it's more than the asking price.
what?
um Chief...
what would you like me to do with these?
I mean, they're obviously a dead end.
uh, lieutenant Tao, isn't arsenic a heavy metal?
which means it would show up on a chem screen of cremated remains.
right, so, want to have those ashes analyzed asap, please?
thank you.
chief, got a minute?
seems the old guy did try reaching out to us for help.
thank you.
after receiving numerous letters to the department,
detective Gordon was dispatched to question the complainant, Donald Baxter.
according to that report, Gordon found Baxter uncooperative.
in fact, the old guy was more interested in asking questions than answering them.
it seemed like a crank, so detective Gordon dumped his complaint in the round file.
I'm sorry -- the round file?
the trash.
but you know what, chief?
we get this kind of stuff all the time.
it's hard enough staying on top of the crimes we find, much less the ones people make up.
and the guy was -- come on, you know.
I know exactly what happened.
Mr. Baxter's old and difficult, and because of that, he was dismissed out of hand.
and I know that that's what happened, because that's exactly what I've been trying to do to him myself.
but we didn't just dump a complaint in the trash -
a few more human beings went with it.
thank you.
were you close with mr. Kaplan?
I am close with all our residents.
Oh, so you remember these folks, then?
Oh, mrs. Roberts -- she was a sweet lady.
she always talked about her late husband.
she used to say he had a great head of hair.
and then she started to forget she'd ever been married.
Oh, poor mr. Hepfner -- after his daughter passed away, he jussat and stared out the window for a whole year before he died.
you cared about them.
Yes.
it's my job.
getting old is scary.
some of our residents lose everything -- family, friends, money.
they run out of life before they run out of time.
did any of these people seem sick before they died?
Yes. They all had the same disease
it's called "old age."
listen, people die at summer view.
we don't jump to murder as the cause.
who has access to their drugs?
the nursing staff.
and the doctor, dr. Reisen.
do you know where he is? I've tried to contact him.
on vacation -- Hawaii for a week, with his wife.
Oh, you don't think -
Dr. Reisen had nothing to do with the day-to-day care.
I supervised the meds.
any chance drugs get mixed up?
we do our very best, ms. Johnson, with patients who forget to take their meds, misplace their pills, and sometimes, simply won't cooperate.
do you think that mr. Baxter poisoned mr. Kaplan himself?
I really don't know.
whatever mr. Baxter's claiming -
this nonsense that we had something to do with it -- that's not true.
Mr. Baxter burned his bridges with summer view and with his son
wait. Wait.
his son?
Yes.
would you like to have a seat, sir?
is my father dead?
no. He's not.
thank god.
so, what, uh, is he absent without leave again?
you need me to take him back to the nursing home?
actually, uh, summer view is refusing to take your father back.
he's made some accusations towards the staff -
this isn't about the poisoning thing again, is it?
listen, it's nothing. Dad used to be a reporter.
he's just desperate for one more story, that's all.
well, some of that story seems to be true.
several people at summer view may have been slipped some arsenic.
Seriously?
wait.
is -- is dad under arrest?
should he be?
of course not.
look, he's a nuisance, that's all.
he spent his entire career questioning people.
it's who he is.
are you close to your father?
Why?
you're not, like, suggesting I should take him home with me, are you?
cause I know it sounds cold, but my life is just not conducive to dealing with his baggage right now.
and when is it conducive?
excuse me?
uh, according to summer view's visitors' log, which everyone has to sign in to enter, you haven't dropped by to see your father in over a year.
and I was wondering if there was some reason. - What's it to you when I see my dad?
I got three kids, an ex-wife in rehab.
and the last time I had the old guy over for dinner, he got my 11-year-old son to help him get online -
to find pictures of people who died from cyanide.
I don't need that kind of crap in my life.
look, I was only asking about your father to see if you had some reason to be afraid of him.
afraid of him?
I hardly know him, okay?
he spent my entire childhood chasing after newspaper headlines.
look, I got by without him then, he can get by without me now.
speaking of which, I need to go.
I left my kids with the babysitter.
excuse me.
your dad's here.
would you like to pop your head in and say "hello" before you head out?
maybe some other time.
I guess mr. Baxter was right.
he has no family.
so, what do you do if you run out of friends and family and money?
it's a reason to kill yourself, but is it a motive for murder?
look, chief, um...
unless you're gonna book the miserable old guy,
I could take him home with me for the night.
it's no problem.
your call.
treat him like a witness...
but watch him like a killer.
let me tell you something --I know women like Doris.
she's emotionally attached to the house.
so a situation like this, you have got to do everything you can to sell her on who you are.
so, in the letter that you write with the new offer, you don't just raise the price a little bit -
you talk about the two of you as a couple -
how you see yourselves living in the house, raising a family just like she did.
even throw in a picture of the cat.
and you offer to help her out on the terms.
she will jump all over it, all right?
trust me. Gary doesn't lie.
we help her out on terms?
all right, look, escrow's one to two months.
today's the 6th.
you give our old lady a 20-day escrow.
end of the month -- Doris has your money in her hot little hands.
so do you, right?
excuse me?
you move another house, especially from someone you listed, and you get cash coming and going.
isn't that right?
maybe you had to move another unit or two by the end of the month to hit your bonus.
is that it?
that's got nothing to do with anythinG.
please.
Gary doesn't lie.
what? What?
where you going?
it's not just the visitor's log -- it's the dates.
it's the dates!
detective Sanchez, may I see those death certificates again, please?
thank you.
detective daniels, were you able to...
track down that manager at summer view?
judd whaley -- he's on his way.
good.
uh, lieutenant Flynn, if you wouldn't mind asking lieutenant Provenza to bring the suspect back in, please?
I'm on it, chief.
has anyone seen lieutenant -- Tao!
got the chem results on those ashes.
you're gonna want to take a look.
I will. Thank you.
um...uh, detective Daniels, if you wouldplease, bring sergeant Gabriel up to speed on summer view's financials.
thank you.
sleep with one eye open?
well, he had me up all hours playing yahtzee.
he's a freak for the dice.
Really? Who won?
what's Whaley doing here?!
just have a few things to clear up, mr. Baxter.
he'll accuse me of everything.
well, we'll see about that, won't we?
buzz, would you please give me one of your legal pads?
thank you.
you keep insisting there's a story here.
you're the reporter.
listen to what mr. Whaley has to say, write it all down, and I'll be back to talk with you in a minute.
you ready, sergeant?
Yes, ma'am, completely ready.
Mr. Whaley, thank you so much for coming in.
certainly.
why don't you have a seat?
the reason I called you in is,
I think it would be in everyone's best interest if you were to allow mr. Baxter back in your facility for a while.
are you serious?
what's she doing? I can't go back there.
shh, shh! We need to hear this.
he really has nowhere else to go.
his family
look, ms. Johnson, there are other patients in our care, and if mr. Baxter was poisoning people, well, for one thing, it's a liability nightmare.
I certainly understand your concern, mr. Whaley, especially since summer view has quite a reputation to uphold.
uh, two awards for state excellence, three commendations by the california seniors association, and eight bonuses, based upon your occupancy within the last year alone.
all this while coping with the extreme loneliness of your residents, which is something that mr. Baxter had in common with the seven people he claims were murdered.
and I've noticed that not only had our victims run out of money, but they had also, according to your visitors' log, exhausted their supply of guests.
no one came to see them anymore.
that happens to many more of our residents than one might like to believe.
well, here's something a bit more unusual.
this is all that's left of five of our victims.
the sixth was lost in a family move.
this is a testament to how badly they were ignoreD.
odd, isn't it?
people who have guests, live.
people who don't, die.
well, the effect of our emotions on the physical body is still a mysterious process, but believe it or not, some of these people likely passed away from depression.
I believe not, mr. Whaley, but then, I have an advantage over you, because you can test for arsenic in cremated remains.
and what we have here are five containers of poisonous ash.
my god.
Oh, but you would never ask us to take mr. Baxter back if you thought he was responsible for this.
no, I wouldn'T.
but I don't think mr. Baxter is responsible, because he doesn't have a motive.
what he does have is a lawsuit, because he brought these poisonings to summer view's attention, and you attempted to drug him with antipsychotics.
well, that was dr. Reisen's diagnosis.
I don't prescribe drugs.
I'm not a doctor. I'm a manager.
the manager who collected the bonuses based on how many rooms are occupied during the first five days of every month.
can you, uh, see a pattern developing here, sir?
you see, it's really -- it's really quite remarkable, because all of your abandoned medicaid patients
they all died in the fourth week of every month, giving you time to rebook their rooms with full-paying clients from your waiting list.
why would I do that?
well, according to your files, every month that summer view has an occupancy rate below...
3%, you collect a $2, 500 bonus.
you had eight of them last year.
now, I'm thinking that maybe you got lucky and someone died naturally on your timetable.
but, still, you poisoned 7 people for under $20, 000.
sergeant.
Mr. Whaley, you have the right to remain silent. Anything you say...
she's good.
Yeah, she's all right, I guess.
I taught her most of this. ...
one will be appointed to you by the state.
have you heard and understood these rights?
you're misrepresenting everything.
we have warrants out as we speak to search your home, your office, and your car.
all I have to do is find the arsenic
just one little package of rough on rats, and it's gonna look very bad for you.
Mr. Whaley, absent your explanation,
I'm gonna have to arrest you on seven counts of murder in the first degree, which is a very different crime from mercy killings.
you know, nurse Townsend told us that these people were sick and unhappy.
it must have been very hard to watch them suffer day after day.
they wanted to die.
there was no quality of life for these people, ms. Johnson.
three of them had a form of dementia and nowhere to go.
Mr. Kaplan, well, he was suffering from congestive heart disease.
and if you'll just -- just
just pause and reflect for a moment.
by controlling the schedule of when these poor people expired -which is all I ever did, making sure they didn't die between the 1st and the 5th, which would have been pointless -
by managing their deaths, I was able to maximize the value of their passing by creating room for people who could better benefit from our service.
people with larger bank accounts.
look, I'm not the person who turned old age into a business.
and honestly, the bonuses I received, as you pointed out, were very small.
Mr. Whaley...
you poisoned these people.
well, that's one way of looking at it, yes, but, really, who cares?
their families obviously don'T.
these old people were dead already.
all I did was make it official.
and by doing it my way, everybody got what they wanted.
so I repeat -- who cares?
unfortunately for you -- mr. Baxter.
well, you have a point there.
so, how about this?
I will refrain from expediting the terminal phase of any future resident's stay at summer view, and mr. Baxter can come back and stay with us for as long as he likes.
and if he agrees not to sue, we'll give him a year for free.
while that is a very generous offer, mr. Whaley,
I'm afraid the state of california would reduce my efficiency rating if I didn't arrest you on seven counts of murder in the first degree, which is what I'm doing right now.
what?
but why are you -- I-I just explained to you.
now, now, hold on one moment!
I thought you said mercy killing and first-degree murder were very different crimes!
they are, but the punishment for both is exactly the same.
are you actually talking about putting me in prison?
don't worry.
it's not that different from summer view, really.
you have to sign in to visit people, friends and relatives tend to forget you exist, and at some point, the state of california might just put you out of your misery.
well, I certainly don't deserve this.
you're right, mr. Whaley.
unfortunately...
it's the worst I can do to you.
did you write it all down?
well, you gave me an exclusive.
I didn't know if I had another story in me.
at least, this way, people will read Bernie's obituary, won't they?
well, I'm sure they will, mr. Baxter.
would you like us to arrange someplace for you to go, or would you like money for a hotel room?
well, really, I was hoping I could go back to summer view. - What?
well, I don't have to worry about being poisoned anymore, and it really is the only home I have, ms. Johnson.
and the summer view senior living corporation just might feel some sense of financial obligation.
I could wind up living there scot-free till the day I die.
Ah, the golden years.
rent-free for the first time since I sold my house.
house.
Oh, my. I almost forgot.
um, lieutenant Provenza, could you please
I've got it covered, chief.
thank you.
here we go, mr. Baxter.
and good luck, mr. Baxter.
you too, young lady.
thank you.
you know, if there'd been a great-looking broad in the department back when this was my beat,
I might never have retired.
Gary Evans dropped your letter by earlier.
I can't begin to tell you how much it means to me knowing you feel so strongly about the house.
it's all lies.
we took advantage of you, and it was a terrible, dreadful thing to do, and I'm so, so sorry.
but gary evans -- - gary lies.
so you're...pulling your offer?
it just wouldn't feel right.
I'd be worried about how you were spending your retirement.
so, yes, I'm -- I'm -- I'm pulling the offer.
Oh, but that's wonderful, dear!
Why?
I hate to say this, but I was never gonna sell this house in a million years!
excuse me?
no, that's why I upped the price.
I didn't think I'd get an offer so soon in this market.
I-I don't understand.
well, when my husband died...
I was a little lonely.
it's so difficult to meet people in Llos Angeles.
I tried going to A. A. For a little while, but it turns out you have to quit drinking completely, which seemed extreme.
so you put your house on the market...
to have a little company, yes.
nothing serious
just nice people like you and fritz stopping by, admiring the house.
say, I have a lot of chocolate-chip cookies left, and I'll give you a bag or two if you promise not to tell gary.
Hi, mama.
no, everything's fine.
I miss you, too.
actually, I was hoping maybe you and daddy could come for a visit soon.
no, we haven't found a new place yet, but...
we'll make room.
y, I just need to get couple of things out of there.
can I just...
I just need, like, two things.
they're right there.
I can see them they're right there.
I don't understand why I can't go over.
okay. I got it.
okay?
make sure you get a shot of the body over there.
what took everybody so long?!
911 received a call around 9: 00 P.M.
that some guy was getting strangled to death in the Toyota section of the parking lot here.
now, you guys pop in about 30 minutes after I find the victim's car!
excuse me, sir, where is the chief?
uh, she's right over there.
I'd recognize those legs anywhere.
Hey, she's not feeling well!
chief? Are you okay?
no.
I'm hot, and I have a fever, and the cold medicine I took is making me dizzy and nauseated, and y'all are incredibly late.
this is off of our victim, who was garroted from behind.
lieutenant Provenza has the murder weapon.
31.0
north Hollywood address.
business card say she's a personal trainer.
there's over $50 in here.
okay, so it's not robbery.
so why are we here?
Robbery/Homicide received five new cases this weekend, so commander Taylor asked us to help him out.
now, if y'all could get started on something and allow me to talk to sergeant Gabriel alone for a moment, please?
so, you're mad at me, is that it?
no.
I'm -- I'm confused.
I called you and nobody answered.
do you see what I'm wearing here?
or did you not read the schedule I gave you this morning?
Where'd you put it?
in your hand.
well, what was it? What'd it say?
it said that we were completing weapons of mass destruction training tonight, that our division deadline is Friday the 26th, two days from now.
so that's all finished, then?
no. No, we're not finished.
we were 17 minutes short of finishing when you apparently demanded that we be sent to you.
now the whole squad has to start the training over again from the beginning.
why is this even necessary?
because the federal government gives us a subsidy for each person that completes the training.
so it's Pope's budget stuff?
Yes, it is.
shouldn't you be in bed?
no.
I should be having a word with the valet.
I-I didn't see anything.
I'm in and out of cars all night, and I was -
I was in one when I pulled around, and the officer, he -
he told me that some guy got killed over there, and that, well, no cars could go out, and that's not good.
I mean, look -- look at how many angry customers.
my uncle, he's gonna be really upset.
your uncle?
Yeah. He owns the lot.
I need to either bring people their cars or give them their keys back.
what is he doing?
is that how it's done here?
you park people's cars, and then bring them back or give them their keys?
according to the placement of the vehicle.
What?! That -- that's mine.
the victim's keys were by his body.
he was walking to his car when someone put a razor wire around his neck and sawed through his jugular.
and you saw nothing?
no, no.
I'm sorry.
I must have been looking the other way or something.
Dr. Morales, I am so sorry I'm late.
I wasn't feeling well.
Oh, hi, Terrence.
sorry to hear you're sick.
you want me to check you out?
sorry. That didn't sound right.
actually, doctor, I am feeling a little weird, a-and the cold medicine I took seems to be makin' my heart race. Is that normal?
okay, first, stay over there, 'cause whatever you have, I don't want it.
sorry.
you want to know my symptoms?
do you have insurance?
Yes, I do.
then see your own doctor.
if you end up dying, I promise to find out why.
may I see you for a moment, please?
well, I'm just about to head into an examination.
let me rephrase that rhetorical question.
I want to speak with you...now.
sergeant Gabriel just informed me you pulled your squad out of WMD training.
that's right, because murder takes precedent over people walking around in hazmat suits.
we seriously need the money the FEDs give us for bringing your squad into WMD compliance.
and I seriously need to find someone who garrotes people in parking lots.
which is more important?
besides, you and I both know that my team isn't going anywhere where those stupid hazmat suits are necessary.
priority homicide must be brought up to WMD qualification.
there is no way around that, so I've rescheduled the training for tomorrow.
tomorrow? - Yeah.
what if I don't solve the murder by then?
no. No way.
or you can lose one member of your squad permanently to counter terrorism.
why do you keep threatening me with that?
and when I'm sick, too.
she's a little spit fire, isn't she?
the garrote killed him, but these marks on his back look to be from a taser.
someone zapped your vic to take the fight out of him.
not a bad plan.
buff guy here.
also, Mr. Cooper had dinner less than an hour before he was killed, maybe a tan Italian restaurant.
looks like pumpkin ravioli.
I don't often find it this time of year.
some risotto, lots of bread.
you sure this guy was a fitness instructor?
that's an awful lot of carbs.
also looks like he had at least a half a bottle of red wine and a dozen raw oysters.
sounds romantic, doesn't it?
Cooper's credit cards are maxed out, so he didn't charge anything the night he was killed.
but here's something interesting.
up until last week, he made daily withdrawals of $500 -
the maximum allowed with his ATM card.
according to my math, that's almost $20, 000 in cash.
why would he need that much money?
blackmail.
expensive drug habit.
any information on our 911 call?
a recording's on the way.
the owner of the phone, who denies making the call, says that he was at a nearby restaurant having dinner at the time of the murder.
three Italian restaurants in the vicinity of where Mr. Muscles was found.
two serve raw oysters, but only one, Il Primo, had pumpkin ravioli on the menu last night - a special.
and a waiter recognized our victim from his DMV photo.
said he had a hot blonde with him, and the babe paid.
please, please hold your applause.
a copy of the hot blonde's credit-card receipt.
thank you, thank you very much.
and the name on the credit card?
Tiffany Lewis? - Yes?
I'm deputy chief Brenda Leigh Johnson, L.A. P.D.
and this is sergeant David Gabriel.
Oh, payback from when I sent Susan the fireman stripper. Is that it?
actually, Mrs. Lewis, we're here to talk to you about Glen Cooper.
did you tell Maria to put the vodka in the freezer?
excuse me.
what is it, honey?
did you tell Maria to put the vodka in the freezer?
I did, Bob.
aren't I a good girl?
who are they?
Um...Mormons.
remember, we're going out to dinner tonight.
I know. Very exciting.
so, I take it that the oysters and red wine that you had at Il Primo were not with your husband?
I can't talk about this right now.
can you maybe just go away?
sure.
as long as you promise to come downtown to my office in, say, two hours.
we can continue this in a more private setting.
I'm kind of busy right now.
or I can come back. It's your choice.
Oh. What am I supposed to tell my husband about where I'm going?
whatever you usually tell him, Mrs. Lewis.
what now, Mr. Howard?
I'm sorry to bother you again.
I need another E.T.A. on when you think the doctor might be ready to see Ms. Johnson.
Any...moment.
just a little more patience, please, okay?
really soon.
we have been waiting 45 minutes.
that's why they call it a waiting room.
deputy chief Johnson.
Yes, sergeant.
Oh. All right.
I'll be there as soon as I can.
Bye.
Brenda, wait.
Hey, hey.
you're sick.
I'm feelin' fine now, and I only have 24 hours to finish this case before my squad has to play war games, and, honestly, it is just a little cold.
you don't have a runny nose. You don't have a cough.
the cold medicine keeps that from happening.
look, just don't worry.
if I get another fever, we'll -- we'll see.
I'll see you at home.
sir.
sir, you can't go back there!
uh, chief, Tiffany Lewis' credit-card statements.
I faxed Glen Cooper's picture to the other restaurants where they ate, and last night's meal wasn't their first dinner for two.
Plus, there are several five-star hotel charges, all here in town.
well, thank you.
all right, then, Mrs. Lewis.
okay, I admit it.
you admit to what, exactly?
I'm having an affair with Glen.
I know I shouldn't be, but I didn't know that it was illegal in California.
honestly, I think that I'm being picked on for some reason.
Oh, Mrs. Lewis, it isn't against the law to, uh, have an affair.
Really?
really.
Oh, my god, you don't know how you guys just scared me.
I almost peed a little.
you're not gonna tell my husband, are you?
I mean, he has a temper, and I didn't mean to start having an affair.
it just happened.
and then it kept happening.
I think it's because guys just want to have sex with me, damn it.
as long as you completely cooperate, I see no reason to inform your husband.
thank god.
our prenup's really bad for me.
when you and Mr. Cooper were leaving the restaurant last night, did you notice anything suspicious?
Oh, I wouldn't know.
let me think.
we left the restaurant, he walked me to my car, he kissed me good night, and I went home.
seems normal.
you didn't valet your car?
last time I valeted my car, the attendant guy stole my pot, so I don't valet anymore.
are you sure your husband didn't know about your affair?
Oh, no.
if he knew that Glen and I were screwin' around, Bob would be just furious.
why are you so interested in all of this?
well, I'm sorry to tell you this, Tiffany, but, um, last night, Glen Cooper was murdered in a parking lot outside the restaurant where -
murdered?
you mean like somebody killed him?
Yes.
I'm so sorry.
no, there --there must be a mistake.
that's wrong!
we're very sorry, Mrs. Lewis.
Oh. Oh, my god!
Oh, my god! Oh, my god!
Oh, my god!
Oh, no!
Oh, my god!
Oh, no.
chief, we got confirmation that, during the murder, when the 911 call was made, the owner of this cell phone was sitting at the chef's table of Chez Bohemia.
he claims his cell phone was in his car -
the same lot where the body was found.
only one other person had access to that phone during the time of the murder.
our valet parker, Kenny Woods.
I just dumped him in the interview room with Provenza.
so, what'd I miss?
hot, married girlfriend of the victim named Tiffany.
I think she wanted me.
thank you, detective Sanchez, for keeping us up to date.
perhaps you can find out where Tiffany's husband was last night and what he was doing during the time of the murder?
more about Mr. Woods, please.
okay, I spoke to Mr. Lang, the owner of the parking lot where Kenny works, and when I asked him about the Toyota section, which is where the 911 caller said someone was being murdered, Mr. Lang laughed.
he said the only one who has a Toyota section is his nephew Kenny.
he also says that Kenny has obsessive-compulsive disorder, which is a fancy way of saying he's a control freak.
now, he takes some medication for it.
I could find out the name if you'd like.
no, thanks, Lieutenant.
does Mr. Woods have a previous relationship with the L.A.P.D?
seems our valet doesn't like it when people pull out of his parking lot the wrong way, whatever the hell that means.
l. A.P. D. picked him up for two little dust-ups with some customers.
and our little weirdo is sticking to his story.
well, then, I'll have to make his stay here very welcoming, then, won't I?
thank you, Lieutenant.
911, what is your emergency?
I just saw some-body strangle somebody in the -- the Toyota section of the parking lot.
and what is your location, sir?
Lang's valet, e-east of Grand.
emergency vehicles are on.
there are more than a few similarities between this caller and you, Kenny.
he reports a man being murdered in the Toyota section of your parking lot, and you made the call on this cellphone, which happened to be locked in one of the cars you valeted.
I - I - I didn't - I didn't make any call.
the caller also stammers.
I...
I didn't make any call.
these are the fingerprints that were found on the cell phone hat made the 911 call.
and these are your fingerprints.
they match.
maybe the phone was on the seat and I moved it.
Ah, you've got a bit of a temper, don't you, Kenny boy?
rap sheet says here that you've been picked up twice for some pretty nasty arguments with customers.
I do not have a-a-a temper!
it's just there's a certain way that cars need to be put in and brought out, and other people, they don't always understand the challenges of valet parking!
did the man who had his throat cut in your lot last night not understand those challenges?
did you two argue?
what? No!
seriously, why -- why would you think such things about me?
because you're not tellin' me the truth, Kenny!
and I have to consider why, and one possibility is that you killed Mr. Cooper because he interfered with the way you ran the lot.
I made the call, okay?
but I didn't --I didn't kill him!
I'm not saying anything else until after I floss.
I-I can't --I can't say anything else.
I need to -- I need to brush my teeth and floss.
why can't you say anything else?
you made the call.
you saw Glen Cooper die.
did you see the killer, too?
were you threatened in some way? - No.
Mr. Cooper was attacked, so you grabbed a set of keys and you locked yourself in a car.
and the killer threatened you as you drove away.
is that it?
can you identify him?
no.
no, no, no.
I'm -- I'm sorry.
can I just --just park cars?
the answer to that, kenny, is yes. - Okay.
I can't compel you to tell me anything.
just remember one thing -
killers don't like leaving eye witnesses around, especially ones who've been talking to the police.
so you be careful in your parking lot tonight.
wait.
don't you have to protect me?
from who? - From that guy!
so we're looking for a man?
what did he look like, Kenny?
how big was he? How old?
no, no, no, no, no.
no.
he will kill me if I talk.
Oh, my god.
Oh! Oh. Look, um...
I think -- I think I'd rather just stay here tonight.
please.
I'll see if I can pull some strings.
Oh. Oh, my god.
thank you.
I know I should've rescheduled with the doctor, but I think I figured out what's going on here.
palpitations, fever, feeling faint.
you have a diagnosis that covers all that?
cold medicine plus stress.
okay.
lowering your pressure at work couldn't hurt, but you still have to see a doctor because I don't think stress causes fevers.
that's from the cold, which is on its way out.
I can tell.
so...
let's talk about the anxiety.
you deal with murders all the time, and it doesn't usually get you this stressed out, so...what's up?
budget issues.
Pope's makin'...
he's makin' my squad go through weapons of mass destruction training for some federal subsidies.
eight hours in those ridiculous hazmat suits.
startin' tomorrow, they're all gonna be runnin' around some potential terrorist target, leavin' me to solve this murder completely on my own...
with Provenza, who I guess is too old for WMD.
it's just -- you see how upsettin' that is?
do you see it?
right.
okay.
you know, I think I know a way you can work the murder and keep your whole team all in the same place.
the floor of this building is not a proper place for WMD training.
Oh, well, according to your qualification manual, which is what I'm going by, "any emergency training to be completed by said group may be conducted in any and all government-owned and operated venues, " not excluding those which might themselves be targets in a terrorist attack.
that sounds like Parker Center to me.
you're deliberately misinterpreting the text.
just so you know, for the next 7 hours and 38 minutes, this squad is mine.
that headgear comes off, if I see one person's face, even a fingernail, no qualification.
and at some point, we have to rescue someone.
I'll leave when up to you.
chief, don't worry.
I'm gonna take the lead here.
we're good.
Mr. Cox, I am happy to help you in any way I can.
I could do that more effectively if I could talk to my squad.
Oh. Use this.
they're on channel 4.
really, making me use that radio system -- It complicates my job.
and what about my job?!
which is to ensure this squad knows what measures to take in the event of, say -
I don't know -- a nuclear disaster.
sir, this is a homicide division, not a bomb squad.
well, according to the paperwork I have, it's both.
what paperwork?
what is he talking -- what is he talking about?!
what is he talking about?
we just need to finish training.
chief ! I checked into Tiffany.
detective Sanchez, use your inside voice, please.
sorry.
I checked into Tiffany's husband, Bob.
the night before last, he has an alibi -- out to dinner.
and I looked into his finances.
he's an efficiency expert with a highly successful consulting firm.
and his prenup with Tiffany --watertight.
I did a phone dump on Lewis' landlines and cellphones calls from Mrs. Lewis to Glen Cooper, but nothing out of the ordinary like private detectives or divorce attorneys.
if Tiffany charged her affair on their joint credit cards, it's all over their statements.
lieutenant Tao, could you please check Mr. Lewis' office lines?
thank you.
and, uh, lieutenant Provenza -- Yeah.
lieutenant Provenza, how's our parking attendant doing?
Oh, he's still here.
Robbery/homicide's watching him for us.
look, alibi or not -- alibi or not, I think that we should have Mr. Lewis, Tiffany's husband, pop in for a visit.
but I can't send any of you to go pick him up, and I can't send lieutenant Provenza by himself.
Oh, this is a nightmare!
sergeant Gabriel, what did Mr. Cox mean when he says, "according to his paperwork, y'all are priority homicide and a bomb squad" ?
okay.
chief, now, don't get mad.
my entire division is officially part of the L. A.P. D.'s counter terrorism bureau?
well, not Provenza.
when were you gonna tell me about this?
look, i-it's only a paper change.
it's so minor, I didn't think you'd notice.
there are five people walkin' around my murder room in noisy, plastic suits.
how could I not notice?
you know, honestly, when sergeant Gabriel came up with the idea for these transfers to save your section from budget cuts, by the way, I thought you'd be happy.
what are you doing? - I'm dizzy, and my heart's pounding.
it only happens when I get really, really mad.
I thought it was a reaction to my cold medicine.
did we establish that you actually have a cold?
I've been gettin' fevers.
I don't know.
have you considered seeing a doctor?
and when do I have time to do that, Will?
if lieutenant Provenza and I are the entire priority homicide division and I have to do everything myself without any help from anybody and budget cuts -
don't overreact. - And I'm not overreacting!
uh, excuse me. Is this a bad time?
no, chief Johnson was just leaving.
actually, it was her who I came to speak to.
I've been watching this Kenny, your valet guy.
we just pulled in this Bob Lewis character, who sergeant Gabriel asked me to pick up.
I was wondering what you want us to do with the two of them.
thank you, commander, for all your help.
if you could please make sure that Kenny Woods makes it into the electronics room with lieutenant Provenza and set up Mr. Lewis in one of our interview rooms, that would be very helpful.
excuse me.
why am I here?
do I need to have my lawyer meet me?
well, um, if you really think that waitin' for legal representation's the best use of your time, Mr. Lewis, we could certainly do that, but knowin' that, uh, you're an efficiency expert,
I wrote down all the questions that I wanted to ask you.
I thought maybe that you could look them over and decide about whether or not you wanted a lawyer.
let's just get this over with.
where were...
uh, where were you the night before last?
that's Wednesday, the 24th.
business dinner at Mastro's.
you want further details, I'll have my assistant e-mail you, okay?
do you... harm the war?
you're kidding, right?
do you know this man?
what man?
Oh, sorry.
here. This man.
Oh, yeah, that's my wife's fitness trainer, Jeff or Chuck or something.
actually, his name is Glen Cooper.
Oh. That's right. Glen.
and he was found dead the night of the 24th outside Il Primo, a restaurant downtown.
that's too bad.
Tiffany was really, uh, tightening up her stomach.
uh...what is this last question?
do you know about the affect?
affair?
that's seriously supposed to be an "r"?
that is illegible.
wait a minute. What affair?
you recognize him?
is this the guy?
the only way we can keep you safe, Kenny, is if you help us catch the killer.
so is this the guy or not?
no.
no, it's --that's-- that's not him.
do you think someone could swing by my house and get my electric tooth brush?
I-I-I'm supposed to use it two minutes in the morning, two minutes at night.
also, my floss --mint, waxed.
you can get that at any drug store.
Yeah, I'll get right on that.
you didn't notice all these charges on your credit cards?
I have a business manager who takes care of the bills.
I hire a lot of people to do a lot of things.
well, I hope she got her money's worth.
so, are we done here?
Yes, sir.
uh, chief, I looked into those...
chief, I am s...
I am so sorry that you had to find out about this transfer this way.
we've -- everyone --we all thought chief Pope had already told you about his -- his decision.
chief Pope's decision?
sergeant, even with your face covered up and your voice distorted by that stupid mask, you are still a terrible liar.
now, stick to the case.
I looked into Lewis' story, and, in fact, he was at Mastro's having dinner at the time of the murder.
that's no surprise.
he doesn't strike me as the type of guy who could bring down someone like Mr. Cooper.
well, a taser could even things out.
Yeah, but does he...
does he seem like the type of guy that owns a taser?
no, but...
no, but he seems like the kind of guy who would hire someone who owns a taser.
we still need a rescue of some kind, and I'm not planning it.
as soon as I'm done with this murder, I'll get right on that.
great, and remember, these people need to demonstrate they can save someone from, one - a life-threatening attack, two - a riot, or three - a natural catastrophe.
I'll leave it to you to decide how that's done.
you have three hours and six minutes left.
lieutenant Tao-- lieutenant Tao,
I need to know what's going on with the Lewis' phones and computers, please.
okay.
starting from the beginning.
no, no, no, no. The end.
quick. Like a bunny.
last Tuesday, a call was placed from Bob Lewis' office to the cellphone of an Eric Ellis.
now, Eric Ellis is not one of our finest citizens.
Ellis has a record --few B&Es, couple of assaults, presently unemployed, which makes the $10, 000 deposited into his bank account on the 22nd so interesting.
could be payment for a hit.
which is why Taylor's guys pulled him in for us.
here's Ellis' record with his booking photo for handy reference.
thank you, lieutenant.
Oh! Oh, for heaven's sake, sit down.
Mr. Ellis, I need to speak to you about where you were at 9: 00 last Wednesday, the 24th.
you mean Wednesday the 25th.
no, I mean Wednesday the 24th, two nights ago.
well, I think I was at the gym on the 25th.
it's the 24th, sir.
and can anyone substantiate that?
Oh, you mean an alibi, right?
Yeah, people saw me Wednesday night.
would one of those people happen to have been Mr. Bob Lewis?
uh, never heard of no one by the name of Bob Lewis...ever.
Really? Well, Mr. Lewis' phone records indicate otherwise, and when I spoke to him earlier about the murder of Glen Cooper -
you spoke to Mr. Lewis about a murderer?
Yes.
so, Mr. Lewis isn't dead?
now you've got it.
so, who got killed?
Glen Cooper -- Mr. Lewis' wife's boyfriend.
on Wednesday the 25th?
it's Wednesday the 24th!
can I see a calendar?
can you explain that whole lawyer thing to me again?
you said you weren't gonna tell my husband about the affair.
uh, it was unavoidable.
I'm sorry.
what am I supposed to do?
I told you about Bob's temper.
why don't you stay here for a while until we're able to deal with your husband?
and, um, lieutenant Provenza, if you could ask Taylor to take Kenny Woods to the restroom for a while, and, uh, put Mrs. Lewis into interview room number 1.
Yes, ma'am.
thank you.
my pleasure.
I'm workin' real hard on gettin' you an attorney, but it would help me a lot if I could take your picture.
is that okay?
Oh, sure.
no, uh, please stand.
thank you.
um, if you could, uh, walk over there to the corner.
and, um...
that's very nice.
now, sort of, um...
slump against the wall, and then slide down...to...the floor.
that's good.
now, uh, stretch your legs out.
good.
now, um, close your eyes.
put your chin on your chest.
good.
now, don't move.
thank you.
thank you so much.
Mr. Cox, I beg your pardon.
I seem to be havin' trouble communicatin' with my squad.
I wonder if you might want to take a look at that.
radio check.
I'll be back in one minute.
sure.
take off.
take off this ridiculous helmet! And the suit!
all of it!
for heaven's sakes.
chief, this could end the entire training session.
well, some things are more important, lieutenant Tao.
now, Buzz, I need you to put on this hat and that suit. Hurry.
you want me to go out there and pretend to be lieutenant Tao?
Yes. Exactly.
do I have to over-explain everything?
Hey!
no, just nod, but you have to do it quickly before Mr. Cox realizes that lieutenant Tao is gone.
I don't know about this, chief.
as long as Mr. Cox thinks that Buzz is you.
he thinks he's someone else on Wednesday the 25th.
you mean Wednesday the 24th.
no, lieutenant, I mean Wednesday the 25th.
lieutenant, I took a picture, and I need you to help me with it.
it's fixed.
looks as if someone took out the battery.
Oh, for heaven's sakes.
how did that happen, I wonder?
me too.
good news, Mr. Woods.
I believe we found the man responsible for the murder you may or may not have witnessed.
no, no, I don't want to look at them.
I don't need you to give me an I. D. anymore.
I just want you to feel safe goin' back to work.
I want you to take a look at these photos and let me know if anything jumps out at you, and then...the floss is all yours.
waxed, mint.
you can use it all the way home to your electric toothbrush.
photos.
this one.
when -- when did this happen?
Oh, uh, that happened this morning.
Yeah. Yeah.
that's --that's the guy.
I was -- I was parking an '07 Highlander when I pulled around, and there they were.
and this guy, he -- he wrapped something around the other guy's neck and he pulled...hard.
and I just -- I -- oh...
so you found a phone in the car that you were parking.
and I called --I called 911.
then he saw me, and he ran over, and I froze.
he banged on the window, and he -- he started screaming that he was gonna -
he was gonna kill me if I told anyone what I saw.
then -- then I heard--I heard sirens, and then he --he ran away.
thank you.
just checkin' to make sure you're all right.
do you need anything?
no.
I think I'm okay.
I don't know.
maybe I'm not okay.
well, you can cry if you want to.
I don't want my makeup to get all ruined.
but it's -- it's-- it's hard.
Glen was really nice to me.
and I know guys are nice when they want something, you know?
or maybe you don't know.
but Glen really cared about me, and now he's gone.
and I have no idea when Bob's gonna let me come back home.
maybe I don't even want to go.
well, maybe you don't have to.
we've looked into your husband's story, and the night that Glen was killed, on Wednesday the 24th.
you mean Wednesday the 25th.
no, Tiffany, I mean Wednesday the 24th.
and you're the second person in an hour to make that mistake.
the other person was Eric Ellis, the man who murdered your boyfriend.
but I don't think he meant to kill Glen.
I think he meant to kill your husband.
that way you could be with Glen and not have to worry about that messy prenup.
don't I get any fourth or fifth amendment somethings?
Yes, you do.
you have, for example, the right to remain silent.
anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
you have the right to an attorney.
if you cannot afford an attorney, the court will appoint one for you.
do you understand what I'm sayin'?
you are going to arrest me for attempting to murder my husband?
no, I'm not.
I would have, of course, if the stupid hit man hadn't made a mistake about what night to follow you and your husband to dinner.
well, that might've been my fault.
I'm not so good with numbers.
but the money that you paid Eric Ellis to murder your husband, that came from Glen, right?
so you wouldn't be connected to your husband's murder.
it's so unfair.
Glen ended up paying for his own death.
I really feel like I let him down.
did you pay Mr. Ellis up front?
what do I look like, an idiot?
I only gave him half.
after you told me Glen was killed, I called and canceled everything.
and I asked for my money back.
Ooh, I should check my messages.
I bet you that blockhead finally returned my call.
um, I'd hold off on that if I were you.
you only get one call, and you might want to use it to contact a lawyer.
what?
but you said...
all right, now, wait a minute, lady!
you told me that I wasn't in trouble for trying to kill my husband!
that's right.
but you are under arrest for what happened to Glen Cooper, which is murder in the first degree.
I didn't hire that guy to kill Glen.
I hired him to kill my husband, and he didn't even do it!
this is a tapestry of justice.
that's what it is --a complete tapestry.
you!
stupid hit man!
stupid, stupid!
you're the stupid person!
you were supposed to kill my husband!
my husband!
I thought he was your husband!
you kissed him!
I don't kiss my husband!
you idiotic...
he's supposed to be dead!
riot!
man down!
man down!
rescue operation in...
I'm goin' -- You're next!
you're next!
you're next!
no, you're next, meathead!
what the hell is going on here?
WMD trainin'.
it's windin' down.
time.
qualification has been achieved.
you may all remove your gear and sign the "q" log, please.
it's okay, Tao.
you can take your helmet off now.
you're Michael Tao?
that's lieutenant Michael Tao.
he's adopted.
hello.
Brenda, this is Dr. Jackson.
Dr. Jackson, this is Brenda.
hello.
since we got a little busy yesterday, uh, agent Howard thought I should stop by, see how you feel.
just, uh, o-one second.
can I talk to you for a moment, please?
excuse me.
I really -- I don't want to do this right now.
well...I do.
okay.
Oh, um...
why don't you have a seat and relax?
and I'll call for you when I'm ready.
so, WHEN WAS YOUR LAST VISIT TO A GYNECOLOGIST?
Oh, UM...
Mmm, A YEAR AGO? MAYBE.
I'm NOT SURE. MAYBE TWO.
Mm-hmm.
so, WHAT KIND OF SYMPTOMS ARE YOU EXPERIENCING?
UM...[ SIGHS ]
well, I'VE BEEN FEVERISH ON AND OFF
for THE PAST MONTH OR TWO.
and, UM, MY HEART STARTS RACING.
my SKIN TINGLES A LITTLE BIT.
it's PROBABLY JUST NERVES.
a LOT OF PRESSURE FROM MY JOB,
and MY BOYFRIEND AND I, WE'RE TRYING TO FIND A HOUSE.
and THE HOUSING MARKET IS RIDICULOUS
if YOU DON'T THINK IT'S PHYSICAL,
why NOT SEE A PSYCHIATRIST INSTEAD OF ME?
swallow.
let's HAVE A LOOK AT THINGS, SHALL WE?
a LITTLE POKE.
I'll RUN A FULL CHEM PANEL AND CHECK YOUR HORMONE LEVELS.
now, I'VE SET UP A TENTATIVE APPOINTMENT FOR YOU NEXT WEEK
in CASE WE HAVE TO DISCUSS YOUR RESULTS.
so, DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, BRENDA?
no, NO.
no QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. BYE.
sanchez: THIS IS THE YOUNGER VICTIM, JESSE ROMERO.
he's A CATORCE.
so IS THE OLDER KID LYING NEXT TO HIM, ANGEL FLORES.

pretty MUCH SHOT WHERE THEY STAND.
right.
Hey, CHIEF.

they're CONFIRMED MEMBERS OF THE CATORCES GANG,
the SAME ONES WE HAD THE
I REMEMBER THE CATORCES, SERGEANT.
excuse US. PLEASE STEP ASIDE.
[ indistinct SHOUTING ] STEP ASIDE, PLEASE.
let GO OF ME, MAN!
uh, NEIGHBOR REPORTED SHOTS FIRED AROUND 4: 40.
that's MY FAMILY IN THERE, MAN!
uh, THE WOMAN CLAIMS THAT SHE SAW BLACK GANG MEMBERS
why IS PRIORITY HOMICIDE BEEN CALLED IN FOR A LOCAL GANG FEUD?
commander TAYLOR REQUESTED US.
is EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?
Oh, NO. I -- YES. I'M FINE, SERGEANT.
thank YOU. LET'S SEE WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.
let ME GO, MAN! THAT'S MY FAMILY IN THERE, MAN!
would YOU FIND OUT WHO THAT BOY IS, PLEASE?
so, COMMANDER, HOW CAN I HELP YOU?
Johnson, AS YOU'RE PROBABLY AWARE,
there HAVE BEEN 12 RACIALLY MOTIVATED GANG SHOOTINGS
in THIS NEIGHBORHOOD OVER THE PAST THREE WEEKS.
this BLACK-ON-BROWN GANG WAR IS BECOMING AN EPIDEMIC.
well, I'M NOT SURE I'M THE CURE FOR THAT, COMMANDER.
I SPOKE TO CHIEF POPE, AND HE AGREES
we HAVE TO START CATCHING THESE KILLERS...
or THIS CONFLICT CAN ONLY GET WORSE.
all RIGHT, DETECTIVE SANCHEZ.
what DO WE HAVE?
it WASN'T A DRIVE-BY.
three CASINGS FROM A . 25-CALIBER.
it LOOKS LIKE THE SHOOTER JUST WALKED UP AND FIRED.
did YOU SAY WALKED UP?
Ugh.
why THIS HOUSE, I WONDER.
the YOUNGER ONE OVER THERE, JESSE ROMERO, 17,
lived HERE WITH HIS MOTHER.
we PULLED A 9-MILLIMETER FROM UNDERNEATH HIS FRONT WAISTBAND.
this BOY NEVER DREW HIS GUN?
never EVEN TOUCHED IT.
so, AT THE VERY LEAST, TAKEN BY SURPRISE.
TAYLOR: OLDER BOY HERE, ANGEL FLORES,
might HAVE BEEN THE SHOOTER IN LAST WEEKEND'S DOUBLE HOMICIDE.
couple OF ONE-FIVES GOT BLASTED AWAY IN THEIR DRIVEWAY.
we BROUGHT THE LITTLE ANGEL IN,
but WE DIDN'T GET SQUAT OUT OF HIM.
ONE-FIVES MIGHT HAVE DECIDED HE WAS THEIR GUY.
I SEE.
all RIGHT. ANYONE HOME?
Flynn: OKAY, MEET OUR POTENTIAL EYEWITNESS
Rosalie ROMERO, MOTHER OF THE YOUNGER VICTIM, JESSE.
right OVER THERE BY THE NEEDLES.
ma'am?
I'm SO SORRY ABOUT YOUR SON.

you WANT ME TO HOLD HER OVERNIGHT?
Yes, PLEASE, LIEUTENANT. THANK YOU.
chief?
that KID YOU TOLD ME TO TALK TO -- HIS NAME'S MIGUEL TORRES.
he's A COUSIN OF ONE OF THE VICTIMS.
he LIVES JUST DOWN THE STREET,
but HE IS OUT FRONT, AND HE'S CAUSING A BIG SCENE.
all RIGHT, THANK YOU.
Miguel: KILL THE ONE-FIVES! BUZZ.
kill THE ONE-FIVES!
I NEED YOU TO CALM DOWN. YOUR FAMILY NEEDS YOU RIGHT NOW.
if YOU DON'T CALM DOWN, I'M GONNA TAKE YOU DOWNTOWN
for INTERFERING WITH A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION, OKAY?
Miguel! THAT'S MY SON! MIGUEL! MIGUEL!
what's YOUR NAME?
my NAME IS CARLOS TORRES. THAT'S MY SON, MIGUEL.
listen, HE'S NOT A GANG MEMBER.
he's JUST UPSET HIS COUSIN WAS SHOT.
he's ALSO INFLAMING THE CROWD.
you're JESSE ROMERO'S UNCLE?
Yes, YES, I AM.
no, IT'S NOT OKAY!
buzz: "WHAT DID I TELL YOU?
you SEE WHAT HAPPENS TO GANG MEMBERS? DO YOU SEE?
no, DAD -- YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS TO LATINOS?
the ONE-FIVES ARE KILLING US. WE HAVE TO FIGHT BACK.
you're BEING A COWARD.
pope: WE HAVE TO FIND WHOEVER MURDERED THESE BOYS
before THE CATORCES DECIDE TO RETALIATE.
if THEY HAVEN'T ALREADY.
well, MIGUEL HERE OBVIOUSLY CARED A LOT
about AT LEAST ONE OF THE VICTIMS.
let's START WITH HIM.
detective SANCHEZ?
excuse ME. PLEASE, MA'AM, MA'AM, MA'AM.
my SON MIGUEL, HE WAS VERY UPSET TODAY.
not BECAUSE HE'S A GANG MEMBER,
but BECAUSE HE AND JESSE ARE COUSINS, THAT'S ALL.
he HAS NO IDEA ABOUT ANYTHING THAT HAPPENED TODAY.
he WAS HOME WITH ME, RECOVERING FROM A KNEE INJURY.
Miguel WAS WITH ME.
he WASN'T WITH YOU WHEN WE WERE INVESTIGATING YOUR NEPHEW'S MURDER.
well, TALK TO HIS SCHOOL. MIGUEL'S NEVER BEEN IN TROUBLE.
he's IN TROUBLE NOW, SIR.
he INTERFERED WITH A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION.
I'm TELLING YOU THAT
ma'am, I'M TELLING YOU,
Miguel IS NOT LIKE THOSE GANG MEMBERS.
he ALREADY HAS A BASEBALL SCHOLARSHIP TO USC.
I RAISED A GOOD BOY.
well, AS A GOOD BOY,
I EXPECT HIM TO COOPERATE WITH THE POLICE.
excuse ME, SIR.
so, MIGUEL, YOU PLAY BASEBALL.
Yeah. I PLAYED BASEBALL ALL MY LIFE.
but NOT TODAY.
your FATHER TELLS ME THAT YOU HURT YOUR KNEE?
Yeah, LAST MONTH.
it'll BE FINE IN A COUPLE WEEKS.
well, MY BROTHERS PLAYED SPORTS, AND I KNOW WHEN YOU'RE HURT,
watching FROM THE BENCH IS NO FUN.
did YOUR COUSIN JESSE PLAY BASEBALL?
Yes.
up UNTIL THE TIME HE WAS CUT FROM THE TEAM LAST YEAR.
and THAT'S WHEN HE JOINED THE EAST-SIDE CATORCES?
answer THE QUESTION.
all RIGHT.
Yeah, THAT'S WHEN HE JOINED THE CATORCES.
someone HAS TO PROTECT OUR NEIGHBORHOOD, OKAY?
you GUYS SURE AREN'T DOING IT.
is THAT WHY THE ONE-FIVE WENT AFTER YOUR COUSIN JESSE?
or WERE THEY HUNTING THE OTHER BOY, ANGEL?
Hey, THEY DIDN'T COME AFTER ANGEL OR JESSE
they CAME AFTER ALL OF US, MAN!
if THEY HADN'T FOUND ONE OF THEM, IT COULD HAVE BEEN ME!
look, MIGUEL, WE'RE JUST TRYING TO FIND OUT IF THE ONE-FIVES
had A SPECIFIC REASON FOR KILLING EITHER JESSE OR
if YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A SPECIFIC REASON, LADY,
then YOU DON'T KNOW MY WORLD, DO YOU?
this IS THE REASON, RIGHT HERE!
the COLOR OF OUR SKIN!
tell HER, MAN! YOU KNOW!
so, THE ONE-FIVES ARE GOING AFTER ANYONE BROWN,
or JUST THE CATORCES?
they're TARGETING THE PEOPLE WHO PROTECT THE REST OF US.
well, I'M ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE, MIGUEL,
and SO IS DETECTIVE SANCHEZ.
so, IF YOU HELP US,
we CAN USE WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT JESSE AND ANGEL
to FIND THE PERSON WHO KILLED THEM.
not IF I FIND HIM FIRST.
I'm NOT EVEN SURE THIS GUY'S IN A GANG,
and LOOK HOW ANGRY HE IS.
the LAST TIME THESE TWO GANGS CLASHED,
six BODIES WOUND UP IN THE MORGUE.
we NEED A TRUCE MEETING TOMORROW.
leaders OF THE CATORCES AND THE ONE-FIVES
so, DETECTIVE SANCHEZ.
I NEED YOU TO SUPERVISE ROUND-THE-CLOCK SURVEILLANCE
for OUR NEW FRIEND MIGUEL.
are WE SET UP FOR THAT IN HIS NEIGHBORHOOD?
well, IT'S MY 'HOOD, TOO, CHIEF.
right.
anyway, YES.
gang INTELLIGENCE SET UP CAMERAS ABOVE THE STREETS IN CATORCE
and ONE-FIVE TERRITORIES.
the COVERAGE IS PRETTY GOOD.
I CAN USE THE VAN, TRACK HIM CAMERA TO CAMERA
and PUT A FEW EXTRA SURVEILLANCE GUYS OUT THERE
where THEY'LL BE USEFUL.
what IS IT THAT YOU THINK MIGUEL KNOWS THAT WE DON'T KNOW?
his COUSIN.
and IF MIGUEL WON'T HELP US DIRECTLY,
then MAYBE HE CAN HELP US FIND JESSE'S KILLER INSTEAD.
chief? YES.
are YOU FEELING ALL RIGHT?
Yes, I JUST NEED TO GO HOME AND LIE DOWN FOR A FEW MINUTES.
chief?
yes?
um, GET BETTER, PLEASE.
you HAVE A GOOD NIGHT, TOO, DETECTIVE.
I KNEW IT!
what?
I TYPED IN ALL THE SYMPTOMS THAT I'VE BEEN EXPERIENCING
on THIS MEDICAL-EXPERT SITE,
and IT'S EXACTLY WHAT I THOUGHT -- STRESS.
which EXPLAINS WHY I WAS SUCH A MESS YESTERDAY
and I'M FEELING SO FINE TODAY.
okay. LET ME TRY THIS.
since I'M ACTUALLY SICK.
I MADE YOU SOME SOUP. WEREN'T YOU HUNGRY?
no. YOU FORGOT TO ADD WATER WHEN YOU STUCK IT IN THE MICROWAVE.
it's ACTUALLY MORE LIKE STEAMING CHICKEN PASTE.
Ooh, KITTY. [ MEOWS ]
I'm SORRY. DO YOU WANT ME TO MAKE YOU SOME MORE?
no, PLEASE. WAIT.
okay.
I HAVE FEVER, CHILLS, BODY ACHE...
no APPETITE.
so I COULD HAVE LYMPHOMA, ANTHRAX...
anthrax?
Lyme DISEASE, VIRAL HEPATITIS...
[ laughs ] ...AND STRESS.
but WE BOTH KNOW I ACTUALLY HAVE THE FLU.
your POINT BEING?
you CAN MAKE YOUR SYMPTOMS LOOK LIKE ANYTHING YOU WANT.
what DID YOUR DOCTOR SAY?
about?
how YOU ARE FEELING. NOTHING, REALLY.
did YOU ASK HER ANYTHING?
no, I FIGURED IF SHE NOTICED SOMETHING, SHE WOULD JUST
Brenda LEIGH JOHNSON HAD NO QUESTIONS.
look, DR. DIOLI TOOK SOME BLOOD.
she SAID SHE WOULD CALL ME WITH THE RESULTS.
I MADE AN APPOINTMENT FOR NEXT WEEK IF I NEED IT,
and SHE DIDN'T SEEM AT ALL CONCERNED,
which INDICATES TO ME, STRESS.
it's STRESS. THAT'S IT.
because YOU WANT IT TO BE STRESS DOESN'T MEAN IT IS STRESS.
the DOCTOR HAS TO LOOK AT YOUR ACTUAL SYMPTOMS,
at THE BLOODWORK,
and MAKE A DIAGNOSIS BASED ON THE FACTS AS THEY ARE.
does THAT SOUND FAMILIAR?
so, THEY WERE SHOT AT JESSE ROMERO'S HOUSE,
so WHY DO WE THINK THAT THE OTHER BOY, ANGEL FLORES,
might HAVE BEEN THE TARGET?
the BIGGEST CONTRIBUTING FACTOR
to LAST YEAR'S CALIFORNIA PRISON RIOTS
a RACE WAR BETWEEN BLACK AND LATINO GANGS.
now THOUSANDS OF THESE SCUM BAGS ARE BEING RELEASED EVERY MONTH
and THEY'RE BRINGING THEIR RACE WAR
back INTO THE STREETS WITH THEM.
and ANGEL WAS ONE OF THEM? LET OUT OF JUVIE 10 MONTHS AGO.
okay.
lieutenant TAO, DO WE HAVE A TIMELINE ON OUR VICTIMS?
more LIKE A PHONE LINE, CHIEF.
the LAST CALL ON JESSE'S CELL CAME AT 4: 14 P. M.
from HIS MOTHER.
right AFTER THAT, JESSE RINGS UP ANGEL FLORES.
23 MINUTES LATER, A NEIGHBOR DIALS 911.
I WONDER WHY JESSE'S MOTHER WAS CALLING HIM.
she MIGHT HAVE BEEN ASKING HER SON TO COME HOME.
no, SHE DIDN'T SEEM LIKE SHE WAS UP FOR VISITORS.
speaking OF WHICH,
is MRS. ROMERO READY IN INTERVIEW ROOM 1?
not QUITE. SHE'LL NEED ANOTHER HOUR.
[ Chuckles ] AT LEAST.
all RIGHT. WELL, WHAT ABOUT THE WEAPONS?
both VICS WERE SHOT BY A . 25-CALIBER.
small BY GANGSTER STANDARDS.
Jesse AND ANGEL'S 9 MILLIMETERS
would HAVE BEEN A LOT MORE EFFICIENT.
had THEY BEEN ABLE TO GET TO THEM.
so, THE KILLER WAS EITHER LYING IN WAIT, OR
or THEY WERE SET UP.
I GUESS, WHAT, THE KILLER RAN AWAY?
did THE 911 CALLER REPORT ANYONE RUNNING AWAY?
just SPOKE TO HER. IDA MARTINEZ.
confirms SEEING SOME BLACK GANG MEMBERS IN A GRAY TRUCK.
wait A MINUTE, THERE WAS A VEHICLE INVOLVED?
she SAW THE TRUCK TWO DAYS AGO.
it DRIVES UP AND DOWN HER STREET OCCASIONALLY,
you KNOW, WITH BLACK GANGSTERS, GUNS HANGING OUT THE WINDOWS.
so WHEN SHE HEARD THE GUNSHOTS, SHE JUST ASSUMED IT WAS THEM.
but SHE NEVER ACTUALLY SAW THEM.
well, NOT YESTERDAY. SORRY, CHIEF.
anything ELSE NO ONE SAW?
the LOCH NESS MONSTER, MAYBE?
Jimmy HOFFA? THE INVISIBLE MAN?
for HEAVEN'S SAKES!
y'all OUGHT TO KNOW THAT THIS IS THE KIND OF INFORMATION
I OUGHT TO BE GIVEN IMMEDIATELY!
I MEAN, WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE?!
there ARE NO WITNESSES AT ALL? IS THAT WHAT WE'RE SAYING?
what ARE WE BASING OUR THEORY OF THIS CASE ON, THEN?
excuse ME.
Yes, DETECTIVE SANCHEZ.
chief, BASEBALL PRACTICE IS STARTING, but I don't think Miguel Torres is going.
I've GOT SURVEILLANCE OFFICERS ON HIM
and HE'S WALKING OFF WITH TWO CATORCES VETERANOS RIGHT NOW.
should I PICK HIM UP?
for WHAT?
chief, these guys that Miguel's with, they're bad news.
I MEAN, IF HE IS NOT IN A GANG RIGHT NOW,
he IS GOING TO BE BY TONIGHT.
he ALSO MAY BE DOING WHAT HE NEEDS TO DO TO FIND THE KILLER.
probation OFFICERS BROUGHT IN A COUPLE OF LEADERS
from BOTH THE CATORCES AND THE ONE-FIVES, BUT SO FAR,
they're JUST SITTING ACROSS FROM EACH OTHER, NOT SAYING A WORD.
I DON'T KNOW IF YOUR GOING IN THERE
is GONNA HELP THINGS OR HURT.
well, I JUST HAVE A THEORY I'D LIKE TO CLEAR UP.
just A FEW SIMPLE QUESTIONS.
which THEY PROBABLY WON'T ANSWER.
not TO MAKE TOO BIG A DEAL ABOUT THIS,
but THESE GANG MEMBERS
generally DON'T RESPOND REALLY WELL TO WOMEN.
they DON'T RESPOND WELL TO WHITE MEN OR POLICE OFFICERS, EITHER.
and ANYWAY, IF THEY'RE NOT TALKING,
how MUCH WORSE CAN I MAKE IT?
Hey. YOU WANT TO BE MY BITCH?
I'm SO SORRY.
my DANCE CARD IS FULL.
I JUST HAVE A FEW QUICK QUESTIONS
regarding THE SHOOTING YESTERDAY OF TWO CATORCE GANG MEMBERS.
a JESSE ROMERO AND ANGEL FLORES.
as HARD AS IT IS TO BELIEVE,
someone WALKED UP TO THOSE TWO YOUNG BOYS IN BROAD DAYLIGHT
in THE MIDDLE OF CATORCE TURF,
murdered THEM IN COLD BLOOD,
and THEN GOT AWAY WITHOUT ANYONE SEEING A THING.
not A DRIVE-BY, WHICH IS WHAT Y'ALL ARE SO FAMOUS FOR.
no, THE SHOOTER WAS ON FOOT.
you KNOW, I CAN'T HELP BUT WONDER
how THE KILLER JUST MAGICALLY APPEARED
at THE SIDE DOOR OF JESSE'S HOUSE
at THE EXACT MINUTE THAT ANGEL AND JESSE WERE TO ARRIVE,
shot AND KILLED BOTH BOYS,
and THEN DISAPPEARED INTO THIN AIR
before THE VICTIMS HAD A CHANCE TO EVEN TOUCH THEIR WEAPONS.
ak-47s DON'T GIVE YOU TIME TO DRAW NO GUN, MA. THAT'S RIGHT.
what IS SHE TALKING ABOUT?
right, WELL, YOU DON'T SOUND VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE.
actually, CIRCUMSTANCES LEAD ME TO BELIEVE
that THE CATORCES MIGHT HAVE BEEN TRYING TO SETTLE
some SORT OF INTERNAL DISPUTE
and ARE JUST LETTING THE ONE-FIVES TAKE CREDIT
for JESSE AND ANGEL'S DEATH.
is THAT POSSIBLE?
we DIDN'T KILL NO ANGEL OR JESSE.
it WAS THESE TWO FOOLS RIGHT HERE.
I'm SORRY, I DIDN'T GET YOUR NAME.
well, I GOT NEWS FOR YOU, SPIDER.
if YOU BOYS DIDN'T KILL ANGEL AND JESSE
and THE ONE-FIVES HERE FIGURED OUT SOME WAY
to STROLL DOWN YOUR STREETS AND KNOCK OFF ANYONE THEY WANT
and THEN DISAPPEAR INTO THIN AIR,
well, YOU'RE PROBABLY BETTER OFF
just SHOOTING YOURSELVES IN THE HEAD RIGHT NOW
and GETTING IT OVER WITH.
makes ME WONDER WHO'S THE BITCH NOW?
boom!
bring IT! BRING IT! BRING IT!
pope: "WHO'S THE BITCH NOW
well, WE WANTED THEM TALKING, WILL. NOW THEY ARE.
and I'M ONE STEP CLOSER TO PROVING
that THIS IS NOT A RIVAL GANG SHOOTING.
Yeah, AND L. A. IS ONE STEP CLOSER TO CIVIL WAR.
if WE CAN FIND OUT WHO KILLED ANGEL AND JESSE,
then WE CAN PROVE TO THESE BOYS THAT WE WANT TO PROTECT THEM.
they're NOT INTERESTED IN PROOF.
they ARE ONLY INTERESTED IN RETALIATION.
I AM TRYING TO CALM THEM DOWN.
does WHAT I WANT MATTER?
listen TO ME, WILL.
you KNOW, I'M STRUGGLING REAL HARD
to SEE HOW THIS MURDER RELATES TO RACE RIOTS
and BLACK-ON-BROWN KILLINGS, AND SO FAR, NOTHING ABOUT IT
connects TO WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT GANG SHOOTINGS,
not THE WEAPON, NOT THE METHOD,
not EVEN THE SCENE OF THE CRIME.
are YOU TELLING ME I'M NOT ALLOWED TO INVESTIGATE
these BOYS' DEATH UNLESS IT FITS INTO YOUR PRECONCEIVED NOTION?
that's NOT WHAT I'M SAYING, BRENDA.
of COURSE I WANT YOU TO FIND THE MURDERER.
but IS IT POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO COLLAR ONE KILLER
without DESTROYING THE ENTIRE CITY IN THE PROCESS?
well, I DON'T THINK THE CITY'S THE ISSUE HERE,
and I THINK IT WOULD DO EVERYONE SOME GOOD TO RETHINK THAT.
[ cellphone RINGS ] INCLUDING THE CATORCES AND THE ONE-FIVES.
excuse ME. THIS IS ABOUT SURVEILLANCE.
I NEED TO TAKE IT.
go.
Yes, DETECTIVE SANCHEZ?
what is it?
sanchez: CHIEF, THERE'S A GROUP OF CATORCE MEMBERS
messing WITH MIGUEL TORRES IN AN ALLEY OVER HERE.
it's A GANG INITIATION.
chief, DO YOU WANT ME TO STOP THIS? NO, NO.
if WE INTERFERE, MIGUEL WILL KNOW WE'RE WATCHING HIM,
and HE MIGHT NOT LEAD US ANYWHERE.
listen, I KNOW IT'S HARD.
chief, IF YOU LET THIS HAPPEN,
his LIFE EXPECTANCY IS CUT IN HALF.
he MAY THINK HE NEEDS TO GO THIS ROUTE
to FIND HIS COUSIN'S KILLER.
listen, DETECTIVE SANCHEZ, WE DON'T HAVE A CHOICE HERE.
if MIGUEL WANTS TO BECOME A CATORCE,
we're GONNA HAVE TO LET HIM.
chief, ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THIS?
so, MRS. ROMERO.
does THIS THING EVEN WORK?
she REALLY DOES KNOW THE THERMOSTAT'S ONLY A CAMERA?
look, SHE'S SWEATING.
it's LIKE AN OVEN IN HERE.
buzz, WOULD YOU CALL MAINTENANCE?
see IF THEY CAN GET THE AIR UP IN THERE, HUH?
there's SOMETHING WRONG WITH HER, I'M TELLING YOU.
something.
so, WHO HERE IS GOING TO ASK HER ABOUT IT?
so, MRS. ROMERO,
you CAN'T REMEMBER SEEING ANYONE IN YOUR HOUSE
yesterday AFTERNOON BEFORE JESSE AND ANGEL WERE KILLED,
is THAT RIGHT?
well, I SAW SHADOWS OR SOMETHING,
but I WASN'T AFRAID OR ANYTHING.
could ONE OF THOSE SHADOWS HAVE BEEN YOUR SON?
no.
the LAST TIME I SAW JESSE WAS IN THE MORNING.
him AND HIS COUSIN WERE IN THE KITCHEN, ARGUING.
again.
what WERE THEY ARGUING ABOUT?
whether MIGUEL COULD JOIN THE CATORCES.
Miguel ALWAYS WANTED TO DO WHAT JESSE DID.
their WHOLE LIVES, THEY WERE MORE LIKE BROTHERS.
we WAS ALWAYS IN AND OUT OF EACH OTHER'S HOUSES, YOU KNOW?
then MY HUSBAND DIED, AND...
he WANTED MIGUEL TO GO ON PLAYING BASEBALL.
so JESSE WAS ACTIVELYTRYING TO KEEP MIGUEL OUT OF THE CATORCES?
Yes. YES.
he WISHED HE HADN'T JOINED, HIMSELF, BUT...
okay, SO YOU SAW JESSE AND MIGUEL IN THE MORNING
when THEY ARGUED, BUT NOT AFTER?
that's RIGHT.
yesterday MORNING.
that's THE LAST TIME I EVER, EVER SAW MY LITTLE BOY.
and DID YOU CALL JESSE AFTER THAT?
no.
why WOULD I?
well, I HAVE NO IDEA.
but WE CHECKED JESSE'S CELLPHONE RECORDS,
and THE LAST CALL THAT HE RECEIVED WAS FROM YOUR HOUSE.
I DON'T REMEMBER.
I DIDN'T WANT JESSE TO BE A GANG MEMBER, I DIDN'T!
I CARED FOR MY SON!
but WHEN JESSE JOINED THE CATORCES,
you THOUGHT YOU'D, WHAT, MAKE THE BEST OUT OF A BAD SITUATION,
is THAT RIGHT? YES.
what DO YOU MEAN?
I BET JESSE GOT YOU A REAL GOOD DISCOUNT ON YOUR HEROIN.
that's WHAT THE CATORCES DO, ISN'T IT, DEAL DRUGS?
I DON'T KNOW.
Jesse DIDN'T SELL ME DRUGS.
well, THESE LOOK LIKE FRESH BAGS TO ME.
were YOU USING IT? NO.
did JESSE LET YOU DIP INTO HIS PRODUCT? NO!
Oh, WELL, MAYBE I'M WRONG. MAYBE YOU WEREN'T JUST USING IT.
maybe YOU WERE DEALING, TOO.
there WAS AN AWFUL LOT OF HEROIN AT YOUR HOUSE,
and IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA HELP ME,
I THINK I SHOULD TELL YOU, ROSALIE,
that THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BUYING AND SELLING.
it IS MEASURED IN YEARS.
no, THAT'S NOT HOW IT HAPPENED!
Jesse HATED ME DOING DRUGS!
those WEREN'T MY DRUGS! THOSE WERE MY DEALER'S DRUGS!
he CAME BY YESTERDAY, TOO!
your DEALER WAS AT YOUR HOUSE YESTERDAY,
is THAT RIGHT, ROSALIE?
rosalie, IF YOUR DRUG DEALER CAME BY YOUR HOUSE YESTERDAY,
then YOU WEREN'T HOME ALONE.
maybe YOUR DRUG DEALER CALLED JESSE FROM YOUR HOUSE.
did YOUR DEALER HAVE AN ARGUMENT WITH JESSE?
is THAT WHAT HAPPENED, ROSALIE?
I CAN'T TELL YOU WHERE THE DRUGS COME FROM.
rosalie, JUST GIVE US A NAME.
there's NO POINT IN GIVING YOU HIS NAME!
and THEY'D KILL ME IF I TOLD YOU.
by "THEY," YOU MEAN THE CATORCES?
Yes, YES!
now JUST LEAVE ME ALONE! STOP IT, PLEASE!
I CAN'T TELL YOU!
okay.
okay, ROSALIE.
okay.
look, I KNOW YOU'RE SCARED.
but YOU TOLD ME YOURSELF HOW MUCH YOU CARE ABOUT YOUR SON.
and RIGHT NOW, YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT HIM,
because YOUR DRUG DEALER
was ONE OF THE SHADOWS IN YOUR HOUSE YESTERDAY,
and I NEED TO TALK TO HIM.
my DRUG DEALER CAN'T TELL YOU ANYTHING.
there's NO USE IN GIVING YOU HIS NAME.
no USE AT ALL.
spider, I TOLD YOU, LEAVE HIM ALONE!
TRANQUILO, VIEJO.
he MADE A CHOICE, OLD MAN. WHAT YOU GONNA DO, HUH?
Oh, YEAH? YEAH!
listen, YOU SON OF A BITCH!
you GUYS ARE NOTHING BUT A BUNCH OF PUNKS!
you KNOW THAT?! CRIMINALS!
let's GO HOME!
let's GO!
you HAND ME THE GUN, AND WE'RE GOING HOME.
hand ME THE GUN!
sanchez: DON'T SHOOT! HOLD YOUR FIRE!
Miguel, LISTEN TO ME! PUT THE GUN DOWN!
put THE GUN DOWN!
Miguel, IS THAT A . 25-CALIBER, MIGUEL?
put IT DOWN.
Miguel, YOU GOT TWO CHOICES!
you PUT IT DOWN NOW OR I'LL BLOW YOUR HEAD OFF!
do WHAT HE SAYS, MIJO, PLEASE!
put IT DOWN.
por FAVOR, DO IT!
turn AROUND.
wait. HEY, OFFICER.
please, I'M BEGGING YOU, PLEASE.
don't ARREST HIM. HE'S MY SON.
sir, HE'S NOT YOUR SON ANYMORE.
he's A CATORCE.
okay, THANK YOU. THAT WAS BALLISTICS BRIAN.
the . 25-CALIBER WE GOT OFF MIGUEL TORRES
is A MATCH FOR THE MURDER WEAPON.
and WHO'S THE GUN REGISTERED TO? WE'RE STILL TRACKING THAT DOWN.
Oh, FOR HEAVEN'S SAKES!
well, STAY ON THEM, LIEUTENANT.
I'm GONNA NEED THAT REGISTRATION TO MAKE MY CASE.
chief?
Yes.
are YOU OKAY?
you JUST DON'T SEEM LIKE YOURSELF LATELY.
I'm FINE, LIEUTENANT.
I JUST...
I JUST NEED YOU TO FIND WHO THE GUN IS REGISTERED TO, PLEASE.
thank YOU.
my SON NEEDS TO TALK TO ME. I UNDERSTAND THAT, SIR, BUT WHAT YOU'RE GONNA NEED
chief, EXCUSE ME. THIS WHOLE THING IS MY FAULT.
I SHOULD HAVE KEPT MIGUEL AT HOME TODAY.
listen, CHIEF JOHNSON,
I PROMISE YOU I WILL SETTLE HIM DOWN.
sir, YOUR SON PULLED OUT A GUN
and ALL BUT THREATENED YOU WITH IT.
he's OBVIOUSLY NOT RESPONDING WELL TO PARENTAL AUTHORITY.
releasing HIM RIGHT NOW IS OUT OF THE QUESTION.
come ON, SIR.
I JUST WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR
that IF YOU ACCUSE THIS MIGUEL TORRES
with A DOUBLE HOMICIDE AGAINST THE CATORCES
and THE CHARGES DON'T STICK,
the GANGS ARE GONNA THINK THAT WE'RE SIDING WITH THE ONE-FIVES.
could TURN LAPD OFFICERS INTO TARGETS, TOO.
so, NO PRESSURE, COMMANDER, IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING?
thought YOU JUST MIGHT WANT TO KNOW THE STAKES, CHIEF.
I AM QUESTIONING A BOY
who WAS FOUND HOLDING THE MURDER WEAPON FROM A DOUBLE HOMICIDE.
to ME, THAT SOUNDS LIKE A PERFECTLY REASONABLE THING TO DO.
if YOU HAVE A BETTER PLAN, COMMANDER,
now IS THE TIME TO SUGGEST IT.
excuse ME.
so, I HEAR CONGRATULATIONS ARE IN ORDER
for THE NEWEST MEMBER OF THE CATORCES.
your FATHER, HOWEVER, ISN'T TOO HAPPY ABOUT IT.
my FATHER REFUSES TO ADMIT WHAT'S GOING ON.
he IGNORES WHAT HE DOESN'T WANT TO BELIEVE.
he PRETENDS THAT GANGS ARE THE PROBLEM BECAUSE HE'S A COWARD,
and HE WON'T FACE THE TRUTH.
he's NOT PROUD OF ME? GOOD.
I'm NOT VERY PROUD OF HIM, EITHER.
what ABOUT YOUR COUSIN JESSE?
would HE HAVE BEEN PROUD?
I KNOW YOU ARGUED WITH JESSE
in THE MORNING BEFORE HE WAS MURDERED.
cause HE LIED TO ME. ABOUT WHAT?
Jesse TOLD ME THE CATORCES SAID I WAS TOO OLD TO JOIN.
but THAT WASN'T TRUE.
I SPOKE TO ANOTHER GANG MEMBER WHO WAS AROUND A LOT,
and HE SAID THE CATORCES DID WANT ME.
which MEMBER, AND WHEN DID YOU ASK HIM?
was IT YOUR AUNT'S DRUG DEALER?
he WAS OVER AT ROSALIE'S HOUSE YESTERDAY.
is HE THE ONE THAT TOLD YOU THAT JESSE WAS LYING?
did YOU CALL JESSE FROM HIS HOUSE?
did YOU WAIT FOR HIM BY THE SIDE DOOR?
did YOU KILL JESSE BECAUSE HE WAS LYING TO YOU?
or WAS IT YOUR AUNT'S DRUG DEALER?!
my AUNT'S DRUG DEALER'S NAME IS ANGEL FLORES, OKAY?!
and HE'S LYING NEXT TO MY COUSIN IN YOUR MORGUE!
I TOLD YOU, LADY, YOU DO NOT KNOW MY WORLD!
listen TO ME!
angel WAS KILLED BY THE ONE-FIVES!
Jesse WAS KILLED BY THE ONE-FIVES!
I DON'T THINK SO.
because WHILE I DON'T KNOW YOUR WORLD,
I DOKNOW SOMETHING ABOUT WEAPONS AND CASINGS.
so TELL ME, MIGUEL...
how COULD THE ONE-FIVES HAVE SHOT THOSE BOYS WITH YOUR GUN?
maybe SHE'S GOT HIM AFTER ALL.
she STILL HAS TO GET HIM TO SAY "I DO.
your FATHER SAID THAT YOU WERE HOME WITH HIM
when JESSE WAS KILLED.
but THAT WAS A LIE, WASN'T IT?
he WAS JUST GIVING YOU AN ALIBI.
I WANT A LAWYER, MAN.
I WANT A LAWYER.
I CAN HOLD HIM ON A WEAPONS CHARGE.
till HE MAKES BAIL.
unless YOU CAN CONVINCE THE FATHER
to LEAVE HIM HERE WITH US.
per YOUR REQUEST.
thank YOU, LIEUTENANT.
lieutenant. JUST ONE SECOND.
I THINK I KNOW EXACTLY HOW TO PREVENT MR. TORRES
from BAILING HIM OUT.
excuse ME, GENTLEMEN.
Brenda: MR. TORRES.
chief, YOU CAN'T DO THIS.
putting MIGUEL IN JAIL
it's GONNA PUT HIS SCHOLARSHIP AT RISK.
a WEAPONS CHARGE? I MEAN
sir, IT'S NOT JUST A WEAPONS CHARGE.
Miguel WAS HOLDING THE GUN
that KILLED YOUR NEPHEW AND ANGEL FLORES.
Oh, GOD.
Mr. TORRES, NO ONE IS BLAMING YOU FOR THIS.
we KNOW YOU DID THE BEST YOU COULD TO SUPERVISE YOUR SON.
and HIS BASEBALL SCHOLARSHIP TO USC,
I KNOW HE OWES THAT IN PART TO THE WAY THAT YOU CARED FOR HIM.
in OUR NEIGHBORHOOD,
parents HAVE TO LOOK AFTER THEIR KIDS EVERY MINUTE,
especially FROM 4: 00 TO 8: 00.
that's WHY AFTER-SCHOOL SPORTS PROGRAMS ARE SO IMPORTANT.
I...
I TRIED TO GET MY NEPHEW JESSE TO PRACTICE HARDER, 'CAUSE I KNEW IF HE GOT CUT FROM THE TEAM,
he COULD BE LOST.
and MY SISTER ROSALIE, SHE DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO CARE FOR HIM.
cause SHE TOOK DRUGS EVERY AFTERNOON?
after 2: 00 OR 3: 00 P. M. SHE WAS USELESS.
I TRIED TO FILL IN WHERE I COULD,
but CHILDREN NEED FULL-TIME SUPERVISION
which MY SON HAD.
he WAS WITH ME DURING THE TIME OF THE MURDERS.
Really?
well, IF THAT'S TRUE, WHY DIDN'T MIGUEL SAY SO?
if YOU'RE HIS ALIBI.
unless, OF COURSE, MIGUEL DIDN'T KNOW WHERE YOU WERE
on THE DAY OF THE MURDER FROM 4: 00 TO 8: 00.
Rosalie TOLD ME THAT JESSE AND MIGUEL
were ALWAYS IN AND OUT OF EACH OTHER'S HOUSES.
if I CONDUCT A SEARCH WARRANT OF YOUR HOME,
will I FIND THAT YOU HAVE KEYS TO YOUR SISTER'S HOUSE,
or ARE THEY ON YOUR PERSON?
someone CALLED JESSE FROM HIS MOTHER'S HOUSE AT 4: 14 P. M.
but IT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN HIS MOTHER, BECAUSE, AS YOU SAID,
she's USELESS AFTER 2: 00.
probably DIDN'T EVEN NOTICE HER VISITORS.
but YOU WEREN'T CONCERNED ABOUT ROSALIE.
you WERE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT YOUR NEPHEW
I WAS THE ONE THAT TOOK JESSE TO BASEBALL PRACTICE!
I'm THE ONE THAT PAID FOR HIS SUMMER CAMP.
I'm THE ONE THAT STOOD BY HIM
and HELPED HIM WITH HIS HOMEWORK, AND WHAT DOES HE DO?
he GOES AND JOINS A GANG.
and HE DOES EVERYTHING HE CAN TO TAKE MY SON ALONG WITH HIM!
he BETRAYED ME!
no, JESSE DIDN'T BETRAY YOU.
he WAS PREVENTING MIGUEL FROM BECOMING AN EAST-SIDE CATORCES.
no. WHAT -- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
Jesse DID EVERYTHING HE COULD
to KEEP MIGUEL FROM JOINING THE CATORCES.
but YOU COULDN'T ACCEPT THE FACT
that YOUR SON WANTED TO BE IN A GANG.
easier TO THINK THAT IT WAS A PROBLEM CREATED BY YOUR NEPHEW,
a PROBLEM THAT YOU COULD FIX WITH THIS GUN,
registered TO YOUR DECEASED BROTHER-IN-LAW,
a GUN ROSALIE PROBABLY DIDN'T EVEN REMEMBER SHE HAD.
now, BESIDES YOUR SISTER,
there ARE ONLY TWO SURVIVING PEOPLE
who HAD ACCESS TO HER HOUSE, AND SO, TO THIS GUN.
one OF THEM WAS YOUR SON, MIGUEL.
and THE OTHER ONE, SIR, WOULD BE YOU.
you HAVE THE RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT.
anything YOU SAY CAN AND WILL BE USED AGAINST YOU
in A COURT OF LAW.
you HAVE THE RIGHT TO AN ATTORNEY.
if YOU CANNOT AFFORD AN ATTORNEY,
an ATTORNEY WILL BE APPOINTED TO YOU -- I UNDERSTAND, I UNDERSTAND!
I DON'T WANT AN ATTORNEY.
just, PLEASE...
just...let ME EXPLAIN.
did YOU GO TO YOUR SISTER'S HOUSE
and CALL YOUR NEPHEW JESSE AND ASK HIM TO COME OVER?
I NEED TO MAKE AN ARREST HERE, SIR,
and I NEED YOU TO TELL ME WHO IT'S GONNA BE
you OR YOUR SON.
yesterday...
Miguel SKIPPED PRACTICE.
I WAITED, BUT HE DIDN'T COME HOME.
I WAS WORRIED.
so I WENT TO GO LOOK TO SEE IF MAYBE HE WAS WITH JESSE
over AT ROSALIE'S.
he WASN'T.
and ROSALIE, SHE WAS PASSED OUT.
and I THOUGHT, MAYBE
maybe THIS IS MY CHANCE TO END THIS MADNESS.
so...
I CALLED JESSE,
told HIM HIS MOM HAD A BAD BATCH OF HEROIN.
I KNEW THAT HE'D COME RIGHT AWAY.
I DIDN'T KNOW HE WAS GONNA CALL HIS MOM'S DEALER
and HAVE HIM COME OVER, TOO.
they WALKED UP TO THE SIDE DOOR.
the MOMENT I SAW THEM,
I STEPPED OUTSIDE,
pulled OUT THE GUN, AND I SHOT THEM BOTH.
for MY SON!
after EVERYTHING THAT I DID FOR JESSE,
do YOU THINK THAT WAS EASY?
after EVERYTHING THAT I DID FOR HIM?
after EVERYTHING THAT YOU DID FOR HIM?! YES!
you SHOT YOUR NEPHEW TWICE IN THE CHEST
at CLOSE RANGE WITHOUT WARNING!
Yes, BECAUSE HE WAS SCREWING WITH MY SON'S FUTURE!
every SACRIFICE THAT I MADE, EVERY
why DIDN'T YOU MOVE?!
Why?
because MIGUEL IS A BASEBALL STAR HERE.
we HAD TO STAY HERE.
don't YOU GET IT?
I WAS JUST
I WAS
I WAS JUST LOOKING OUT FOR MY SON.
who's GONNA LOOK OUT FOR YOUR SON NOW
between THE HOURS OF 4: 00 AND 8: 00, HUH?
who's GONNA DO IT?
all RIGHT, THAT'S ENOUGH, DETECTIVE SANCHEZ.
lieutenant FLYNN,
would YOU PLEASE TAKE MR. TORRES TO BOOKING
and ARREST HIM ON TWO COUNTS OF MURDER IN THE FIRST DEGREE?
is THAT REALLY NECESSARY?
okay.
Yes. THANK YOU.
Dr. DIOLI WANTS ME TO COME IN FOR SOME MORE TESTS.
she'll DISCUSS POTENTIAL DIAGNOSES
at MY NEXT APPOINTMENT.
I'll GO WITH YOU.
okay.
look, I DON'T THINK THIS IS LIFE-THREATENING.
honestly.
your SKIN IS TINGLING.
you're HAVING NIGHT SWEATS, MOOD SWINGS, HOT FLASHES.
I THINK WE BOTH ALREADY KNOW WHAT THIS IS, DON'T WE?
no.
probably.
I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT RIGHT NOW.
Why?
if THERE'S ONE THING MY JOB HAS TAUGHT ME...
everything CHANGES WHEN YOU SAY IT OUT LOUD.
testing. One, two, testing.
not here. In the back.
Hurry!
by the pool. Set up by the pool.
hurry up, buzz. We need to fish him out.
Ow!
I didn't see you, buzz.
Yeah, it's okay. Just step back.
I'm deputy chief johnson
wait a second. You're bleeding.
one more minute won't hurt.
are you sure?
Yes, madam.
okay. I'm deputy chief johnson, priority homicide.
a dog walker stopped by the home of Mr. Oliver henry and found the body in the pool.
okay, detective sanchez, now that we've memorializedthe body, let's pull this poor man out, please.
sergeant gabriel, phd.
the first officersarrived at the scene roughly 12 minutes after Mr. Henry's death was called in.
uh, since it was clear that he had been dead for some time, the officers decided to leave the crime scene undisturbed.
all right, if you got a close shot, let's turn the camera off until
for heaven's sakes, would someone please quiet down those dogs?
hello.
lieutenant tao, priority homicide division, lapd.
the swelling of the victim indicates he's been in the water eight to nine hours.
though bloated, we can identify him through his driver's licenseas the owner of the house.
hold it right there.
arguably the most successful divorce lawyer in Los Angeles.
by all accounts, he was a good man, a decent man, a man who loved his job.
ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the prosecution isgonna prove to you Mr. Henry was murderedby the defendant who verbally and physically threatened the victim repeatedly in the weeksright up to his death.
now, Mr. Cordry here, the lawyer for the defense, is gonna argue that mr. Henry's death was accidental, but I need you to pay very close attention to the inconsistencies you'regonna see with that theory on this videoand throughout the case.
to start, you'll notice the contusions visible on Mr. Henry's forehead.
roll it.
looks like he ran into something right here.
I got it.
a little overdressed to go swimming, don't you think?
okay, let's get his shirt --how it's untucked.
this seam here...
a tear in the knee...
and the cuffs of the pants...
here...and there.
and the scuff marks, too, buzz, on the shoes.
thank you.
would you move, please?
move back? Thank you.
chief, you see this?
could be drag marks.
I got it.
lieutenant tao, I want youto check and see if there's any leather from the victim's shoes around the pool.
thank you.
sergeant gabriel, would you mind showing me where Mr. Henry kept his clothes?
thank you.
he's all yours, gentlemen.
he takes excellent care of his wardrobe.
his closet's as big as my kitchen.
chief, what are you looking for?
signs of wear, and I'm not finding them.
sergeant gabriel, would you check these suits and shirts for frays and tears?
and, lieutenant provenza, I want these shoes and clothes put into evidence, please.
as neatly as he kept them...please.
thank you so much.
Oh, yeah.
okay, until recently, oliver henry was partners with his wife, valerie, in the law firmof henry and henry
considered the number-two divorce law firm in the city.
clientele includes celebrities, politicians, and the very rich.
fees average $500 an hour for associates, twice that if you want oliver henry specifically.
cheaper to hire a hit man.
so, you're saying Mr. And Mrs. Henry were partners?
Yeah, well, they divorced, too -- just settled about three months ago.
they're still in the process of dissolving the firm.
now, he was considered the rainmaker, and she was regarded as, you know, kind of average.
her payoff isn't. Valerie henry is still listed as the beneficiary of our victim's $10 millionlife-insurance policy.
she's not answering a phone.
all right, detective sanchez, what did we learn from the neighbors?
it's not a good place to have a block party, chief.
I mean, nobody knows anyone.
all I got is this kid who saw a black beamer, maybe a convertible, parked in henry's driveway around 9: 00 last night.
hmm, black bm win the hollywood hills.
that narrows it down to, like, 50, 000 people.
Hey.
any chance this hollywood divorce attorney accidentally fell into his own pool?
cause the media are already insisting that one of his movie-starclients killed him, and we just can't afford that kind of murder right now.
we are slowly whittling awayat a list of suspects.
great. How many are we down to?
not counting the wife, roughly 758.
what?
our attorney's case load.
Henry and henry currently have 379 active divorce suits, each with a client and an irritated spouse.
that's casting a pretty wide net.
and how do you feel about your own wife's divorce attorney?
Yeah, okay.
what would really make me feel a little better, though, is some evidence that a crime was actually committed, because if the guy just fell
excuse me. Uh, dr. Morales will see us now.
wonderful. Thank you, sergeant.
if the autopsy report reads,"accident
Yeah, or suicide. Suicide would be great.
I'll be sure to let you know.
don't make work for yourself.
all right, y'all, let's start checking Mr. Henry's clients and their spouses, see if any of them have a criminal record.
I want to know if any of them drive a black bmw.
let's dump the victim's cellphone, see who he was talking to.
and find the ex-wife, please.
thank you. Sergeant gabriel.
sorry.
I'm documenting the scrapes on the back of his knucklesand fingers.
could this have happenedby accident?
on just one hand, I'd say yes.
on the other hand, too
looks more like he was dragged from behind.
but the contusion's the front of his head.
no hemorrhaging though.
low impact.
it looks like he ran into a door or fell from less than his full height.
and he didn't block the blow with his hands.
so, let's say it happened something like this.
someone was walking Mr. Henry along, let's say, from his house to his pool, and he started to pass out.
and they let him slip which explains the scrape on the knee.
and dropped him.
so he hits his head --kaboom.
but not hard enough to knock him unconscious.
right, so, Mr. Henry falls, and our killerturns the victim face up, grabs him under his arms, and drags him to the pool
ow, ow. That's too hard.
sorry, chief. Sorry. -That's too hard.
this only makes sense if Mr. Henry was drugged or drunk.
no alcoholin his bloodstream.
I'm doing a tox screen, but I won't know for sure until we get it back.
wait a minute. Check under his arms.
his suit coat was ripped there, and if you pull hard enough...
good call.
and when the tox screen came back positive,
I just felt like there was no way I could comfortably state the death was accidental.
thank you, dr. Morales.
your witness.
so, this, um, this drug that turned up in Mr. Henry's tox screen was, again?
midazolam --better known as versed.
it's a sedative, among other things, not availableby prescription.
and did you findany fingerprints on this versed, doctor?
it's a liquid, sir.
and had been metabolized, so, no.
then there's no way to prove that my client administered this drug?
is that correct?
I wouldn't know.
I'm here to discuss the medical aspects of the case.
well, then could you tell the members of the jury what types of medical professionals use this drug on a regular basis?
anesthesiologists, mostly, but those working in a surgical field would have access to it.
so, while the state has focus edits efforts on the defendant, isn't it true that any doctor, nurse, or medical professional could have accessed this drug?
or someone close to a doctor, nurse, or - -objection.
that calls for a ridiculous amount of speculation.
sustained.
let me ask you this, then, doctor.
is it possiblethat Mr. Henry, who had recently suffered a divorce, who was splitting up his business with his ex-wife, administered the drug to himself?
and on the way to his pool, stumbled and fell, hit his head, but managed to pull himself into the water before he passed out?
is that possible?
Yes, but I would say highly unlike - "yes" is sufficient.
no further questions.
no redirect at this time, your honor.
call your next witness.
do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth so help you god?
I do.
I tried very hard to figure out how Mr. Henry's death might have been an accident or suicide, but the more I learned, the more certain I became it was murder.
did you arrive at Mr. Henry's house with that idea in mind that his death was a homicide?
no.
in examining the crime scene, did you immediately conclude that oliver henry had been murdered?
absolutely not.
I don't see how it could beany thing else, especially with this tox screen.
yeah? What does it say?
Oliver henry tested positive for versed, which isn't available even by prescription, so someone must have drugged him.
uh, your car insuranceis late again.
look, why don't you just sign this form and...
what are you looking for?
I know I had some ho hosin here, and I'm sure I had a ding dong in the freezer.
I threw all that stuff out.
what? Why?
the doctor said,"no more sugar."
sorry.
uh, what were you saying about my insurance?
that it's late again.
look, do you want to combine our finances or not?
really, just, you know, tell me because it really doesn't matter to me.
I thought we agreed if we put all our money in one place, it would make it easier to get preapproved for a loan.
Yes, but then you never do anything about it.
well, I was planning on doing that next week.
you keep on saying that, and then nothing ever happens.
here, please.
here, sign this form and that signature card.
that puts you on all my bank accounts, okay?
and then you can just close yours.
now I feel bad. I didn't expect you to do all of it.
I don't mind doing it! That way it gets done!
well, I should be doing something.
I would be happy with your signature.
so, your victim ingested versed? -Yes.
did you find the vialit came out of or the glass he drank it from?
no.
so, henry gave himself a knockout drug, cleaned out the glass or buried the vial, walked quickly to the pool, fell, hit his head, knocked himself out, and then dragged himself into the water.
well, that sounds reasonable.
agent howard.
Uh-huh. Yeah, no, I'm coming.
Uh-huh. Yeah.
Ah, so, chief, it turns out henry's 23 active cases
he was either verballyor physically threatened by the opposing spousesin at least 11 of them.
that we know of.
Henry even pulled restraining orders on this guy, this lady here, him, and him.
now, and this one... this one right here --this one peed on his car.
lovely.
any of them drive black bmws?
well, there's at least seven in the ballpark.
uh, two were navy blue, one was a mercedes.
now, this guy over here, he was a double play -- restraining order and the car to go with it.
Oh, good.
let's talk to him.
so, on the fourth day of your investigation, you were still concentrating on at least seven people.
eight --including valerie henry.
the victim's ex-wife, correct? -Yes.
apparently, she'd been out of town since the morning Mr. Henry was found dead.
before that?
I'm afraid I was alone in my new apartment that night, so I can't offer you an alibi.
thank you for continuing to hold.
and so after you heard about your ex-husband's death?
I got in my carand drove to palm springs before the press attacked.
vultures. I couldn't face talking to them.
Mrs. Henry, since your ex-husband died under suspicious circumstances,
I wonder if you wouldn't mind telling me why you two divorced?
money, mainly.
or the way I spent it.
sad part is, I filed for divorce just to
just to get his attention. I never thought we'd actually go through with it. So stupid.
Mrs. Henry, um, did your husband have a drug or alcohol problem?
was he chronically depressedor suicidal?
no, no, just the opposite.
Ollie was stable, trustworthy.
he was an eagle scout. Did you know that?
it still meant something to him.
Uh...thrifty, brave... whatever.
he could still recite the whole silly oath by heart.
and you'd think someone like that would be dull...repressed.
but not ollie. He was decent.
too decent.
maybe I, maybe I didn't deserve someone quite so - solid state insurance...
Oh, hello? Hold on, please. I'm so sorry, Mrs. Henry.
I was on hold for 15 minutes before you got here.
Hello? Yes. Hi. Uh, fine. Thank you.
um, I'm calling to inquire about your multiple-driver discount.
I want to find out what kind of rate my fianc and I can -- ?
Oh, no, please don't put me on hold!
your call is important to us. Thank you for continuing to hold.
I'm sorry.
you were saying?
you're getting married. Oh...
Yes. Well, I'm engaged... so, yes.
putting all your things together?
bit by bit. It is time-consuming.
when you take it apart, too.
speaking of which, were you satisfied with your divorce settlement?
Oh, ollie was...fair.
I got a lot of cash, and he got the house.
and max and mathilde, too.
the dogs.
and you have them now, right?
well, yes, I should have had them in the first place or at least joint custody, anyway.
Ollie thought I didn't pay them enough attention.
Mrs. Henry, are you aware that you are still named as the sole beneficiary of your ex-husband's life insurance?
are you sure? -Oh, I'm positive.
your ex-husband dies, and you get $10 million.
look, Ms. Johnson, even the fairest divorce attorneys make enemies. It comes with the job.
one party feels they're not getting enough, the other party feels they're giving too much.
you make enemies just doing the right thing.
well, is there any particular client or spouse he was concerned about?
well, he didn't talk much about it -- attorney-client privilege.
but he was getting flak from someone -- the husband of a client, about a flarpl that
I'm sorry, a what?
family law attorney's real property lien -- flarpl.
sounds like something you'd get at a dairy queen...in india.
well, it's a law permitting asshole divorce lawyers to put a lien on a client'shome to ensure payment.
your second wife?
all right, if you all don't mind going over these names again and see if any flarplsor "fliprls" turn up? Thank you. Thank you so much.
and what did you find in rechecking the names?
we found five f-flarpls.
Flarpls?
Fla-- flarplsamong Mr. Henry's cases.
had any of those five been issued against someone with a black convertible bmw?
one --against the defendant.
your honor, this would be a good time to stop for the day.
okay. Ladies and gentlemen, remember your oath.
you are not to discuss this case with anyone, including the members of the press.
we'll reconvene here tomorrow morning at 9: 00.
and let me remind the reporters present
you are to conduct your business outside the four walls of this building.
good job. -I hope so.
with judge tiano disallowing the dog hair from valerie henry's mangy pets...
you arrested the rightguy. Don't worry about it. -That's why this isso frustrating.
I keep going over everything in my head.
if I had been able to get a confession, we wouldn't even be here in the first place.
Ah, look, look, look, look, look.
we have a media scrum we have to walk through.
so before you walk into that
commander taylor will coach you through your statement.
that's ridiculous. I know exactly what to say.
no, you don't and you're irritableand you snap at people.
I do not. We shouldn't even be talking to the press. Vultures.
I want to thank you all for your interest in this case.
the lapd has decided that commander taylor will be fielding all your questions today.
thank you. Thank you so much. Pardon me.
uh... well, um, let me, uh, make a short -- a brief opening statement here.
we feel that this case represents the best that our justice system has to offer.
good morning.
let me remind you, deputy chief johnson, that you are still under oath.
Mr. Garnett, you may proceed.
thank you, your honor.
good morning, deputy chief johnson.
we left off yesterday discussing the exhaustive search you made of Mr. Henry's current and past clients and their spses.
among the five people against whom he had issued flarpls, you found onewith a black convertible bmw.
Dr. Jonathan schafer.
and who is he?
he's an ophthalmologist, and his wife, kristen schafer, hired Mr. Henry to beher divorce attorney.
and then henry took out a flarplagainst the schafer residence.
what?
Henry put a lienon schafer's house.
sorry. I have to take this.
Hello? Yes, uh, multiple-driverrate. That's right.
you all go on.
um... -I know this.
okay.
anyway, chief, uh, we have reports of a confrontation between dr. Schafer and Mr. Henry.
Schafer left threats on henry's voice mail.
and registered to schaferat the dmv is a 2006 black bmw convertible.
and this divorce was acrimonious?
uh, that point doesn't fit so well. Dr. Schafer and his wife ended up reconciling.
what?
sorry. That is twice what I'm paying now.
no, I don't. You know what? Just forget it, okay?
thank you so much.
problem?
I'm trying to combine fritzand my car-insurance policy for a discount, and I-I-I can't seem to get it for some reason.
I got a guy. Let me see what I can get you.
are you sure? I-I don't --yes.
because then that will free you up to figure out all this business with the flarpl, the car, and the knock out drug adds up to specific evidence against dr. Schafer.
there must have been other doctors that henry was suing.
do you have a license plate on this bmw?
no.
look, I'm meeting with the wife later on this afternoon.
I'll get some more background information.
look, I know we have some blanks.
well, fill them in, now, because having all seven of you working on this case for over a week when we still can't say definitively if this is a murder
Oh, no, it is. It is. I'm sure of it.
and this dr. Schafer --he is our best bet.
please don't gamble, especially with the press looking over your shoulder because the evidence you've got is enough to ruin this guy's life but not enough to arrest him for murder.
if you're gonna continue to go after schafer, do it with a whisper.
so, chief...what now?
so, I last saw Mr. Henry --hmm
I guess it must have been, gosh, just a day or two before he died.
that's when you told him you and your husband had reconciled?
trying to reconcile.
which was his original advice --Mr. Henry'S.
the day that I hired him, the first thing he told me was, "see if you can work things out with your husband."
and why did you file for divorce in the first place?
jonathan was having an affair with this girl in his office.
kind of clich?
doctor's wife losing out to her husband's receptionist.
but that's over, and he swears she was the only one.
and you believe him?
I'd like to.
my family, you know?
did you know your husband had threatened your attorney.
but jonathan would never have actually done anything violent. He's...
he's an ophthalmologist not a biker.
he may be a cheat, but he's not a killer.
I know my husband.
you didn't know he was having an affair.
I think I did.
I just...didn't want to believe it.
uh, do you know where your husband was the night of the murder?
well, no.
he's still staying at the beverly wilshire until we figure things out.
look, why would jonathan kill my attorney...
...especially after I told him we could maybe give our marriage another try?
if I change my mind, I'll just hire another lawyer.
he can't drown them all.
let's find this receptionist that dr. Schafer was cheating with and talk to her.
and I want to get a search warrant for dr. Schafer's car.
maybe you can look through the bmw while I talk to him.
maybe he won't even know we did it.
sergeant, this is a murder, isn't it?
I think so.
and on paper...
I mean, the doctormakes a good suspect, yeah, but I thought his wife made a good point.
I mean, she drops her divorce, the lien goes away.
Dr. Schafer kills the attorney -- why?
I don't know the answer to that yet.
maybe the good doctor can tell me. Thank you.
I'm so sorry I'm so late.
um, yeah, I never get it right.
is it an optometristor an ophthalmologist who performs eye surgery?
an ophthalmologist.
and which one are you?
the surgery kind. -Okay.
so, what is this about? What did you guys want?
nobody told you why you were here? -No.
no. I got a call. Someone asked if I could talk to the police.
and when I arrived, almost...an hour ago, a white-haired guy, he just told me my rights and left me here.
I'm so sorry.
we are talking to so many people today.
that white-haired guy's normally really sweet.
he must have been in a rush.
um... I'm sure that you heard aboutwhat happened to oliver henry?
Yeah, the guy who almost got my wife to divorce me.
I heard he died -- fell ina pool or maybe pushed him.
exactly. So we're investigating his death.
no, no, no, no, no. Don't worry. Standard procedure.
we're talking to all his clientsand their spouses -- people like you and your wife.
it's taking us some time.
you've talked to kristen? -Yes.
standard procedure.
um, she said... that she actually followed Mr. Henry's advice and that maybe you two were working things out?
Yeah, we're trying.
I, uh, behaved badly --very badly.
I'm trying to do everythingI can to rebuild her trust. It's hard.
I wish I could just go backand do things differently.
well, hindsight's.
little eye-doctor humor for you.
Ah. Very good.
so, um, you were mad when your wife hired Mr. Henry.
you -- you yelled at him.
Yeah, I didn't have a very adult response to the whole thing.
I -- I, um... ...Made some calls in the heat of the moment that I -- it was so stupid.
she had every right to hire an attorney.
I think I just didn't want it to be my fault.
I wanted it to be henry's fault, as irrational as that sounds.
they finished searching the bmw, chief.
well, let's finish up here so you can be on your way.
um, so, we have three questions that we're asking everyone about the night that oliver henry died.
um, where you were... what you were doing, and who you were with.
sure. Of course.
that was, um...
as a matter of fact, I was out of town.
Really?
Yeah. I was on a sort of a get-my-head-together fishing trip with a buddy of mine.
a-a-and the name of your friend?
topper. That's two p's, lieutenant.
we were on his boat for four days.
I think -- I think I have the number right here.
Yep. There it is. 3-- well, here.
thank you. Perfect.
and, um, uh, the name of the boat?
uh, super plum.
we were -- we took it out of marina del rey.
talk to topper. I was with him the whole time.
all right, then.
thank you.
you can stop it right there.
so, my client told you he had an alibi.
what's the problem?
well, as is often the case of those suspected of committing murder in the first degree, your client lied.
so, my client produced an alibi, and you decided was fake.
I didn't decideit was fake. The alibi couldn't be verified.
neither the boat nor the man dr. Schafer told us about existed.
isn't it true, Ms. Johnson, that you and your squad have been restricted from working overtime?
Yes. We have to apply for -- -do you ever feel any pressure to solve cases faster?
I wish I could solve everything faster, sir.
I drive myself to find killers - - well, what if my client's alibi were out there somewhere, and you couldn't find it simply because you lacked the time or the resources?
time was not the issue.
so, S.I. D. Isn't done with the stuff they vacuumed out of the car yet.
they say they're gonna need at least another two hours.
but look, chief, we've done master searches on this guy topper barnes, and he doesn't exist.
what about the phone number dr. Schafer gave us?
dead end. Registered to a disposable cellphone.
we're finding out where it was purchased.
chief, bottom line, you'd have an easier time finding santa.
I mean, what kind of a name is "topper," anyway? It's ridiculous.
Topper's boat is no where to be found, either.
can't find a registration the super plum, and no local marina has ever heard of it.
chief, I put the receptionist from schafer's office in interview room number one.
her name is michelle edwards.
she brought her portfolio with her like we do tv or something.
take a look. Great set of twins.
thank you, detective sanchez.
lieutenant provenza, would you please look after miss edwards? Thank you.
I'll take that, boys.
and I'll need to familiarize myself with the subjects -- subject.
Hey! Why does he get to go
uh, lieutenant flynn, see if you can give dr. Schafer a ride back down to parker center.
maybe he knows where we can find his invisible friend.
well, I'm sorry. This case isn't quite wrapped up yet.
but I'm expecting any minute - this isn't about the case.
there's a problem with your insurance, and your rate won't be going down.
what about your broker guy? -He can't do anything.
I thought you said -he just can't.
uh, look, you should talk to fritz.
is there something you know that I don't?
um, I'm not sure.
you know what? I really shouldn't even be involved in this.
just tell me!
okay.
Fritz has two D. U.I. S on his record about a month apart from, like, five years ago.
D. U.I. S? -So you didn't know. Great.
but fritz doesn't drink.
right.
okay.
the information is all in that report.
if you decide to discuss it with fritz, just don't tell him you heard about it from me, please?
and I'm -- I'm sorry to bethe bearer of bad news.
really.
Yeah, right. I bet you are.
where are you from? -Well, I'm from dallas.
I actually just moved here about two years ago.
Hey, hey, hey.
I only worked at jonathan's office during the day.
I'm an actress, and the hours didn't conflict with my classes.
it's nice to have that kind of day job.
and before that, I was a waitress at a sports bar.
the doctor's office was loads better than getting your ass pinched for tips all day.
men are such pigs.
Hello, michelle. I'm deputy chief johnson.
I just have a few questions to ask you because we're investigating the death of kristen schafer's divorce attorney, and we hear that you wereinvolved in the divorce.
Yes.
that's why I'm not working with jonathan -- dr. Schafer -- anymore.
his wife found out that he was seeing me, and I was let go.
and were you surprised by that?
Yeah.
he told me for months that his marriage was technically over, that I made him feel like more of a man.
but then he totally freaked outwhen she was leaving him.
it just makes me wonder what other lies he was telling me.
well, have you seen or spoken to dr. Schafer since he treated you so badly?
he met me for lunch once, sort of a goodbye thing.
and then I called him after I heard about her lawyer dying on the news.
and what did he say? -He was surprised.
but he couldn't really talk because she was there.
and he'd just gotten back into town.
from?
some boat trip he took for the weekend with his friend, topper something.
and did you ever meet this topper in person or -not in person.
find out where he's from -No, no -or what he did for a living? -No, nothing.
okay.
well, thank you so much forgoing over all this with us.
the lieutenant here will show you out.
Oh, so, am I free to go, then, or
well, just a few more standard questions that we -- we ask all of our witnesses.
first, since you, uh, broke up with dr. Schafer, have you started dating anybody else?
no, not yet.
Oh. That's too bad.
and what is the best wayto get in touch with you?
excuse me, chief.
Yes, sergeant.
lieutenant flynn is back with schafer. They're in interview room two.
you might want to talk to our ophthalmologist about what S. I.D. Got back from the vehicl
no fibers from the henry home, no chemicals from the pool...
dog hair.
do the schafers have pets?
no, chief, but remember, the victim had two dogs.
and S. I.D. Vacuumed the house really well after we were done with it, and guess what.
we matched the hairfrom the victim's dog to the hair in dr. Schafer'sconvertible.
Oh, thank god!
Oh. Sorry.
sergeant, excuse me.
Oh, thank you. Thank you so much.
Dr. Schafer. I am so sorry to interrupt your day, but, um,
I just have a few more things I'd like to clear up.
such as?
well, uh, oddly enough, though we have done our very best to find this friend of yours, the reclusive topper barnes, he seems to have disappearedoff the face of the earth.
or perhaps he sailed off the edge of it in the fabulous super plum, his magical and invisible boat, since no one else has ever seen hide nor tail of it but you.
ms. Johnson, excuse me, but I think you should knowI've already called my lawyer.
whatever for?
because I didn't like leaving here the last time and getting in my car and finding out that you people had searched it.
and honestly, that dumb-blonde act of yours didn't fool me for a minute.
you seem like an expertin dumb blondes.
you sure you don't want to talk to me?
I can make things so much easier for you, less embarrassing for your wife and daughter.
may never have this chance again.
I'm gonna stick with my lawyer.
listen, I didn't kill anyone.
well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, dr. Schafer.
I don't believe you.
lieutenant.
since you already have a lawyer, you understand your rights.
you're under arrest for the murder of oliver henry.
I think we've gota problem.
with what?
chief, something you have to see. I was going over our case file.
you got the S. I.D. Results, got the search warrant.
you got the dmv regon schafer's bmw.
see?
deputy chief johnson, you remember dda garnett.
Yes. Hello.
he's had a chance to review the evidence in the warrant in question.
perhaps you would like to tell him about your concerns.
well, my concerns are that this man killed his wife's divorce attorney.
and, um, some of the evidence that we have to prove that may be in admissible.
well, if it was just the transposed license plate numbers, I could probably swing that, but...
There--there's something else?
detective danielswas very specific about what you were looking for in dr. Schafer's car, and nowhere does it mention dog hair.
and I could probably swing that on its own, but I have to add it to themixed-up license plate numbers.
I don't know. It's gonna depend on the judge.
but let me ask you this
is this the guy?
I mean, you know this is the guy?
I do. I absolutely do.
but you have no evidence to prove it, Ms. Johnson.
not that oliver henrywas murdered or that myclient was anywhere near him the night he died.
as for the drug found in Mr. Henry's system, we've already established the possibility that he could have self-medicated and fallen into the pool.
on the whole, the evidence points - - evidence?
like scuff marks?
those scuff marksare not present on any other pair of Mr. Henry's shoes.
and we found bits of matching leather in the cement around the
excuse me, madam. I wonder how many people in this courtroom have scuff markson their shoes.
I know I do.
does that mean someone has tried to kill me? I don't think so.
and do we know when the shoes were scuffed?
can you say, ms. Johnson, that mr. Henry injured his footwear the night he died?
no.
no. So, frayed cloth, a couple of knee and knuckle scrapes, scuff marks, an unidentified bmw parked in the drive wayof Mr. Henry's house, and that's it, yes?
you have no physical evidence at all, do you?
yes or no, Ms. Johnson?
chief johnson, you will please answer the question about the physical evidence.
I don't have a yes or no answer.
but the lapd found no evidence specifically linking my client to the scene of the crime.
isn't that what you're telling us? -No.
I'm sorry? You have other evidence?
your honor, I demand an answer. -Fine.
in dr. Schafer's car, we found dog hair from the victim's
Objection! The witness knows that evidence has been disallowed.
you asked, for heaven's sakes!
counselor, as boneheadedas it may be, you did ask.
I -very directly.
so I will allow chief johnson to answer.
thank you, your honor.
Mr. Henry owned two dogs.
we matched the dna of the victim's pets to the dog hair we found in dr. Schafer's bmw.
excuse me, your honor.
your honor, I would like to request a brief recess.
permission to approach the bench, your honor?
I'm sorry, your honor, but a witness for the defense has unexpectedly shown up.
the defense team had ample time -we did not plan this, your honor.
who is it? Who?
topper barnes, the guy with the boat -- my client's alibi.
Mr. Garnett.
topper barnes, who assured me did not exist, shows up out of the blue.
Mr. Garnett, we did our due diligence on Mr. Barnes.
it seems to me the timing of his arrival is awfully convenient.
just tell me what I need to do. -Break schafer's alibi.
otherwise, jeopardy is attached.
if the case gets dismissedor goes to jury, the doctor walks, and I look like an idiot.
we'll never be able to prosecute anyone else for this murder because the case we're having now creates all the reasonable doubt a jury's gonna need to let the next defendant off the hook.
this is a nightmare.
I will meet you back in your office in one hour.
commander taylor, what can you tell us?
actually, deputy chief johnson will be taking your questions today.
have a nice weekend.
to Be Continued
good morning.
you know...
we haven't spent any quality time in the guest room yet.
Really?
are you okay? - I'm fine. Just a back spasm.
are you okay? - I'm fine. I'm fine.
old football injury.
shoot!
I'll just let voicemail get it. - No, I'm fine. Please.
go answer. You're vibrating.
well... i was. Hello?
Gabriel said it's a hit-and-run, so it should be an easy day.
yes? - Maybe...
we could meet back in the guest room -- say around noon?
noon? Are you sure?
Oh, I'll be ready. I told you -- it's just a muscle spasm.
Really?
do not doubt the fbi.
I won't.
you and daniels?
working out some kinks, you know? - Yeah, it's a little rough.
morning, sergeant. Commander. Nice tie.
Thanks.
good morning. Oh, what a lovely day.
is she all right?
so, why are we here?
uh, chief, at 6: 10 this morning, a shop owner found what he described as a "dead homeless dude" in the alley behind his building.
so, now priority homicide is handling "homeless dudes"?
well, technically, he's not homeless.
responding officers found a parole I. D.In his wallet saying he lives at a halfway house in north hollywood and that his name is roy wilkinson.
they called me, and I thought it best to get priority involved.
what is that smell? - Margaritas.
one is never enough, two is too many, and 12
well, you're looking at 12.
Yeah. It looks like roy got hit by a car
coroner's investigator estimates the body's been here since 2: 00 A. M.
like I was saying, maybe roy passes out, a drunk driver heads down the alley, runs him over, and keeps going.
there's no lights back here and no sign of skid marks.
I've got officers searching the area for damaged cars and a few more knocking on doors to see if anyone's heard something.
well, no one has answered my original question -- why is this a priority?
chief, this speed bump is roy wilkinson. - Who?
in 1999, roy wilkinson was convicted of manslaughter after killing his girlfriend, carly mayhan.
it's amazing, commander -- two pieces of bullshit in one sentence.
first, carly wasn't his girlfriend.
he picked her up in a bar.
and, second, manslaughter, my ass!
it was flynn's case. I think it's safe to say that he took issue with the jury's verdict.
they should have put this guy in jail for life.
instead, he only gets eight years.
Carly mayhan is davis mayhan's daughter -- the movie producer.
it was all over the news.
not in atlanta.
somebody must have used roy's name on an open channel.
well, chief johnson, you might want to tune in tonight, because I assure you every network is going to run with this story.
well, commander, don't let me stand between you and the cameras.
chief, I could do a thorough investigation right now.
a murdering scumbag alcoholic passes out in an alley and gets run over by a car, leaving the world a much better place.
I'll write it up, and we'll all be home by noon.
look, I'd love to be done with this by noon.
you have no idea how much I'd like to be done with this by noon.
but we have a dead body, a bunch of nosy reporters, and somebody fled the scene.
so nobody is gonna be done with anything by noon!
now, who has the number for the halfway house?
the place is run by a private foundation.
they call it a re-entry center.
this one is hooked up with the parole program at victorville.
Yeah, most of these slugs treat parole like a weekend pass.
they don't even get unpacked before they're back into trouble again.
I'm karen silva. I'm the manager here. Can I help you?
Yes, madam. We're with the L. A.P. D.
we wanted to talk to you about roy wilkinson.
what happened?
I'm afraid there's been an accident, madam.
Roy was hit by a car. - Roy's dead.
Oh, no. What happened?
um, they found him in an alley early this morning.
it appears he'd been drinking.
poor roy. It's a shame he fell off the wagon.
Yeah, more like under it.
you don't seem surprised.
I've learned not to be surprised anymore.
I thought roy was getting better.
people just don't understand how hard it is for these men.
hard for them?
lieutenant... why don't you go interview sleeping beauty over there, while ms. Silva shows us roy's room?
that sound good? - Sure. Come with me.
this is roy's bunk.
which one of these dressers is roy's?
the one on the right.
no family photos.
Roy was like most of the guys who wind up here.
if he had any family, they didn't want to have anything to do with him anymore.
how did, uh, how did roy get along with the other residents?
well, I'm not here around the clock, but I would know if there were any problems.
I did hear that someone on the outside was hassling him.
who would that be?
I asked him. He didn't want to talk about it.
that's his one-year A. A.Chip.
he just got it.
he was so proud.
did -- did roy have a job?
he just lost another one.
do you think that might be one of the reasons why roy started drinking again after a year of sobriety?
I've learned through experience that alcohol doesn't need a reason.
I think these should cover everyone who's been in residence here for the last year and a half.
thank you. If you think of anything else at all, please give us a call.
Yes, do.
um, could you get us a copy of roy's death certificate?
for... - well, there won't be a funeral.
they'll just cremate him unless somebody sees to the details. I don't think that's right.
no, that doesn't seem right. I'll make sure we send one over.
thank you.
thank you, Ms. Silva. Yes.
hang on, lieutenant tao, o-one second.
uh, what did he say about roy?
quiet, kept to himself -- you know, the usual homicidal-maniac routine.
you can stay and talk to the rest of them.
Yes, lieutenant?
right now?
bam!
Daniels called from the morgue.
Roy had both his femur bones crushed, plus cracked ribs and massive internal injuries to the chest.
we assumed that when the front wheel went over the upper body that the rear wheel went over the legs.
we've been running over all these dummies trying to figure out how roy managed to get two sets of injuries so close together.
Yeah, but the only way the tire patterns made any sense was that when the car ran over the body, it suddenly turned to the right.
but the alley is too narrow.
it would have hit the wall, and there's no paint marks anywhere.
please. My head is about to explode.
I assume you didn't bring us back down here just to catalog all the things you don't know.
there's a trail of oil right down the middle of the alley.
there's a lot of oil in this alley.
there is, but not all of it's fresh.
walk with me. Please.
this puddle of oil here, a few yards from the body, comes out of nowhere, which got me thinking
when the car ran over roy wilkinson, roy did a little damage to the car.
maybe broke the oil pan.
that's what I'm talking about.
this spot here tells me maybe the driver stopped, got out, said,"oh, my god. What have I done?"
then took off again. Walk with me.
so, now the car is leaking oil, and we can follow the oil trail like breadcrumbs.
walk with me.
shows us exactly where the car went.
walk with me.
walk with me.
walk with me.
the son of a bitch drove around the block
came back to finish the job.
while the vehicle ran over roy wilkinson a second time, we were able to follow the oil trail around the block, but, unfortunately, onto the westbound 10, and then it was impossible to isolate it.
well, at least now we know we have a murder.
and now we know we're looking for a car with a damaged oil pan.
and we've been checking with garages, tow companies, auto dealerships to see if anyone brought in a vehicle with this type of damage, but so far, nothing.
I tracked down most of the residents.
none of them admits to knowing much about roy.
any of them own a car?
well, there are two cars at the halfway house.
one belongs to this guy -- jim francis.
but supposedly he can't drive it, as he got his license suspended.
the other one is a datsun 210 -- couldn't go over a pothole, much less a person.
but I've got S. I.D. Checking out both vehicles for any traces of roy juice.
any word from roy's parole officer?
his voicemail says he's out of town. Comes back tomorrow.
anything useful come out of commander taylor's press release?
four calls saying it is a good day,
a guy called and said that he killed roy wilkinson, though he claimed he shot him, an insurance agency, a couple of ambulance-chasing lawyers, and 13 people reporting reckless drivers.
and a partridge in a pear tree.
okay, well, I think that we should follow up on all of them, please.
and in the meantime, I think we should focus our efforts on trying to find a car with a newly broken oil pan.
and, sergeant gabriel, just give me one minute.
and I think that we should introduce ourselves to the mayhans.
thank you.
hello. You've reached fritz howard.
leave a message, and I'll call you back.
I'm so sorry, fritzi.
my hit-and-run turned out to be a hit-and-run-around-the-block- and-then-hit-'em-again...
and run. Anyway, my entire day is shot.
so I was hoping that we could reschedule our nooner To an eighter...
or a niner.
sergeant gabriel mentioned that you were about to go see the mayhans.
I am.
let's go watch some tv.
Carly mayhan's killer was found dead in what police say was a hit-and-run after spending eight years in prison.
pick a channel -- any channel.
for davis mayhan, this is not the hollywood ending he would have envisioned, but perhaps it will provide closure.
I can't help what they put on the news.
but you can't ignore it.
are you telling me I can't talk to two possible suspects?
please. "Persons of interest" is the correct phrase.
and explain to me why the mayhans are more viable suspects than an entire halfway house full of recently released convicts.
because the mayhans have a motive.
listen, my first interview with a sus
a person of interest is the most important, - seeing how they react before they've had an opportunity -- - yes, thank you for the tutorial.
now allow me to give you one.
I, uh, I think I should go.
no. No, no, sergeant. Stay, please.
I think it's important for you to understand how to strike a balance between what chief johnson does and what i do.
because, you see, for all of her talents, your boss has a tin ear when it comes to politics and handling the media.
while chief pope seems to think of nothing else.
Yeah, because, sergeant, when the media see her face at the mayhans', it will become impossible for chief johnson to run an investigation on her terms.
well, thank you so much for the advice, but I would rather not give the mayhans time to consult an attorney or get their story straight.
did you really get the impression there that I was offering you advice?
sergeant, were you under that impression?
no, sir.
listen to me.
if you speak with the mayhans, you will do so in my office.
so you are ordering me to call the mayhans and invite them down here at their leisure?
Oh, no. No. I do not want you to call the mayhans.
Hey, laura. Andy flynn.
Yeah, I'm fine. Thank you. And you?
Oh, that's good.
so, I guess you heard about today's fortunate events.
well, that's why I called.
I know how much this means to you and davis, and I would love it if the two of you could stop down at parker center today so we can catch you up on all the details of the case.
cause you deserve to know. All right, great.
okay. See you soon.
anyone else you want me to lie to?
thank you, lieutenant. I know that was unpleasant.
but it's all for the best. - For who?
these people trust me, chief -- or they used to.
and I'm hoping to eliminate them as suspects.
let them bring a lawyer into this, it's just gonna drag on and on.
that asshole strangled a 22-year-old girl while having sex with her, and the court only gave him eight years.
now you want to drag these nice people through the mud over his death?
sometimes good people are capable of bad things.
there have to be consequences for that.
when the guy getting run over is roy wilkinson, then the consequences ought to be a ticker-tape parade.
we don't get to determine which victims are worthy of our attention, lieutenant.
and we can't pick and choose which parts of the justice system we want to uphold.
that's beautiful, chief.
so, if you'll excuse me, I think I need to throw up a little.
it's good to see you, andy. - You too, laura.
you're looking good. Lose weight?
Yeah, well, I went vegetarian, but don't tell my friends back in jersey that, okay?
uh, this is my boss, deputy chief brenda johnson.
hello.
and this is her boss, assistant chief will pope.
good to meet you. - How do you do?
thank you so much for coming in to speak with us today.
thank you. We know that you don't have to do this.
so, I assume you've heard a little bit about what happened this morning.
when the reporters started gathering on our lawn, we figured something was up.
we heard it was a hit-and-run.
there are facts that lead us to believe that roy wilkinson was murdered.
facts?
and if we don't get out ahead of this, we're afraid that the press might start jumping to conclusions.
Andy, what's she saying?
um, I-I'd like to know if you and your wife have had any contact whatsoever with the victim prior to his death.
a victim? - Mr. Wilkinson.
now he's the victim.
the last time I saw that monster was in a courtroom, and he got an eight-year sentence for murdering my daughter.
okay. Good.
now, just in order to dot our I's and cross our t's, we'd like to take a peek at your cars, if you don't mind.
you're kidding.
all right. It sounds like we're suspects.
Andy, do you think we're suspects?
look, laura, davis, I don't like this...
listen, the more careful we are with this now, the less damage the press can do to your reputations.
lieutenant flynn can come to your home in an unmarked car with a couple of our lab guys
no, that won't be necessary.
you can't look at our cars -- not without a search warrant.
Mr. Mayhan, our intent here is not to upset you.
too late.
we really just wanted to eliminate you and your wife as suspects.
you want to eliminate me as a suspect? - All right, honey.
was it a long, painful death?
was he brutally tortured before he died?
no. - Then it wasn't me.
well, that went real well.
Fritzi, I've spent the entire day smelling a boozy corpse and getting yelled at.
I'm not feeling very romantic.
neither am I.
how was your day?
well, if you can't fall asleep, you ought to be able to watch tv.
this is ridiculous. I'm taking you to the doctor. - No doctors!
they're just gonna tell me what I already know to stay at home, lie flat on my back, which I am trying to do.
well, I can't just stand here and watch you suffer.
W-what -- what are you doing?
what are those? - They work for me.
vicodin? Where did you get vicodin?
last year -- for my procedure. - I can't take your pills.
well, fine. Then I will call Leland and have him get you your own prescription.
put the phone down, please. - You are getting help
you're not helping me. - Yes, I am.
stop! Brenda. Sweetie.
I appreciate what you're trying to do, but giving vicodin to an alcoholic is not help.
Oh, right. I'm sorry. No pills.
I don't know why I keep forgetting that.
because you constantly dismiss addiction as a problem and we never talk about it ever.
okay, fine. Let's discuss it now.
now? Really? Seriously? In the middle of the night, - while I'm lying on the floor in pain? - Oh, sorry. Sorry.
well, what can I do?
get me your big bag of cookies, the remote to the television, and answer your phone.
answer your
deputy chief johnson's line.
may I ask who's calling? Just a minute.
detective daniels. - At this hour?
Hello, detective daniels. You're working late.
no reason to go home.
uh, I just got off the phone with that insurance investigator
Jim petersen of American omaha life.
life? Roy wilkinson had a life-insurance policy?
watch where you're going!
uh, on the low end -- $80, 000.
petersen is gonna fax over the full policy tomorrow morning, but he did tell me over the phone the beneficiary is A...
ex-wife or ex-girlfriend?
I'm not sure who she is.
but I can tell you where she works.
reporters have been calling here all day.
please. - Thank you.
I don't feel like talking to any of them.
do you know one reporter tried to ride the bus with me?
I mean, really.
were you and roy close, Ms. Simmons?
Oh, I don't know. I'm not here every day.
I-I volunteer a couple times a week, so I don't get a chance to get to know most of the men really well.
I had no idea roy was the one that did all those awful things to that mayhan girl.
he was kind to me.
I was helping him with his G. E.D.
I just... can't believe this.
did roy ever talk to you about money?
well, not really.
other than to complain he didn't have any.
he had enough to pay for a life-insurance policy, and he named you as the beneficiary.
a-a what?
life insurance. See?
your name -- right here.
why would he do that?
you didn't know he was leaving you this money?
no, not at all. Roy didn't say a word.
good lord.
even my husband didn't leave me anything like that.
Oh, I-I don't feel right taking this.
Roy must have cared for you very much.
well, I try to treat all of them like they were my own kids.
did you ever get the sense that roy was drinking again? - No.
anything out of the ordinary happen recently that might have upset him?
an argument? Old girlfriend?
there was something.
a couple of weeks ago, someone sent him flowers.
flowers?
but they didn't make him happy. He just threw them out right away.
do you know who sent them? - No.
or what florist they were from? - No.
but I took the flowers out of the trash and I brought them home.
the arrangement was beautiful.
still haven't found any cars in the neighborhood with damage done to the oil pan, and S. I.D. Says the two cars flynn found at the halfway house are clean.
and as for those flowers, I'm coming up empty on roy's secret admirer.
the flower business is nothing.
I mean, roy probably had one of those wacko pen pals while he was in prison
you know, lonely ladies who love from a safe distance.
Yeah, but if we could tie those flowers to the mayhans, then that might give us enough to get a warrant to search their vehicles.
baloney. I'm telling you -- the flowers are a waste of time.
but they're all we have to go on so far.
so check the visitors logs for the prison and halfway house, please.
and, lieutenant tao, I'd like you to get in touch with all the florists in the area.
I want to know who sent those flowers. - Don't bother.
and why would I not bother, lieutenant?
I sent the flowers.
please tell me why, lieutenant.
because it's the anniversary of carly's death, and I wanted roy never, ever to forget what he had done, because i wasn't going to.
so you sent him flowers?
and a card.
so, what did this card say?
what did the card say?
it said... "happy death day."
that is just enough for a decent defense attorney to make you a suspect in roy's murder.
chief, every year, this date hits me.
I mean, don't you have a case that you took a little more personally?
Carly and her parents deserve justice.
and whether you like it or not, roy wilkinson deserves the same.
you do understand that the right thing for me to do is to take you off this case?
please don't.
the, uh, parole officer's here.
thank you.
I was up north, trying to find another one of my parolees who decided not to call in.
jackass. So, what did I miss?
I was hoping that you could give me some inside information on roy wilkinson.
in your opinion, was he just another jackass?
so-so.
did you know that roy took out a life-insurance policy?
he left the money to a Ms. Simmons at the halfway house.
well, some ex-cons find jesus or mohammed.
Roy found an insurance agent.
or an insurance agent found roy.
did he have any enemies at the halfway house? - No.
any drinking buddies?
no, no, no. Roy always passed his drug tests.
he was a regular at A. A.Meetings.
what would cause someone who's been sober for a year to start drinking again?
you know, guilt, depression -- usual stuff.
I understand it was hard for roy to keep down a job.
Yeah. Yeah. Roy got fired a few times. - Why?
well, as roy tells it, laura mayhan would show up wherever he was working, pass out newspaper clippings, telling his employer and the customers how roy had murdered her daughter.
not a lot of businesses looking for that kind of P. R.
so Mrs. Mayhan was harassing him?
well, you know, you ask a judge -- no.
I mean, Mrs. Mayhan was not breaking any laws.
she could tell his employer any story she wanted.
did you ask her to stop?
you know, I've been doing this a long time, and here's the thing
not everyone stops when you tell them to.
Mrs. Mayhan...
I don't think she wanted to stop.
I understand. - No, no, no, no, no.
look, I'm being ordered to do this. - I don't care whose fault it is.
Hey, guys, over here. They're here.
is davis mayhan a suspect in the murder of roy wilkinson?
do you have any new evidence here?
Congratulations. I've never seen you handle the press better.
I didn't say a word to them. - Exactly.
now that they've seen you here, I'm gonna have to give them something.
I'll try and keep it vague, but I can tell you right now, lead on the story is "davis mayhan -- suspect in wilkinson murder."
well, commander, given your media skills,
I'm sure you'll find some handy way to spin this to our advantage.
so, spin, commander. Spin.
our attorney's already been on the phone with your chief pope, and he did not authorize this search warrant.
a judge authorized the search warrant.
and none of this would have been necessary if you had simply cooperated and if your wife hadn't lied.
what are you talking about?
two days ago, you both assured me that you hadn't seen roy wilkinson since his sentencing, when, in fact, your wife has been following him and harassing him.
that is ridiculous. Laura.
I wanted the world to know the truth about that man.
Roy thought that he could get a job and just go on with his life. - Oh, my god.
I couldn't let that happen.
you understand that whoever ran him over must have been following him.
how else would that person have found him in that alley?
I followed him in his car, but I did not kill him.
Roy didn't have a car, Mrs. Mayhan. - Of course he did.
are you sure you remember clearly?
maybe someone was giving him a ride.
our lawyer said not to talk to anybody.
don't talk to me like I'm 5 years old,Ms. Johnson.
I know what roy wilkinson looks like.
I remember every wrinkle on his face.
and I remember the crappy, blue oldsmobile toronado with the old blue plates that he's been driving.
and I remember the look in his eyes when he walked out of that courtroom.
you think I don't remember?
the truth is, I can't forget!
do you happen to remember where you were the night he was murdered?
that is enough.
do you remember the license - plate number on this blue car?
5-g-b-k-92. - No. No.
5-g-b-k-92! - Go back.
5-g-b-k-92! - Please. Sweetheart.
5-g-b-k-92! - Go upstairs.
5-g-b-k-92! - Please, don't. Sweetheart.
thanks for looking out for us, andy.
s. I.D. Said there's no damage, no sign of recent repair, no blood, no skin, no clothing from roy in any of their cars.
can I go back to being a suspect now?
5-g-b-k-9-2 does come back to a blue 1991 oldsmobile toronado.
it's registered to a guy named jerry nemec.
Yeah, he did seven years for robbery -- died three years ago.
now, the thing is, his registration is up to date, and his last known address --halfway house.
maybe jerry nemec left his car to roy?
no. Roy was in prison when jerry died.
they didn't live at the house at the same time.
besides, this car never showed up in flynn's search.
so where is it?
well, maybe one of roy's buddies at the halfway house took it off his hands after he died.
wait a minute. Wait a minute.
it says right here that jerry nemec was killed in a hit-and-run.
and it looks like he had a life-insurance policy, too.
I wonder if anyone else at the halfway house has a life-insurance policy.
thank you. Jim francis? - Yeah.
I'm brenda. - Okay.
I just have a few questions for you. - Okay.
now, how long ago were you released from prison?
about eight months ago.
and how long have you been in A. A.
about eight months... off and on.
are you drunk right now?
um, define "drunk.
do you own a car, Mr. Francis?
Yeah, but my license is suspended.
do you have any friends or family that chauffeur you around town?
me and my family aren't exactly close.
well, that explains why you haven't designated any of them as beneficiaries to your life-insurance policy.
what life-insurance policy?
that's not your signature?
no. - Thank you.
ladies. Thank you so much for coming in.
I would have come to you, but -- crazy day.
Any-old-how, I have copies for both of you of roy wilkinson's death certificate.
you'll need this to collect the life-insurance policy that roy left you, and karen will need one for the mortuary.
have you decided what kind of service you're gonna have yet? - Not yet.
is it going to be like the one you arranged for jerry nemec?
I'm sorry?
Oh, shoot. I forgot my glasses. I'll be right back.
okay.
we have nothing to worry about.
we didn't have anything to do with this.
so, sergeant, you see how useful it is to observe a person's first reaction to information.
ladies.
they were here all along.
sweetie, it only gets worse.
Oh, that's what I've heard.
you both are so incredible.
all the good you do for these men, it's not surprising that they'd want to do something nice in return.
well, a good deed is its own reward.
sure, but a good deed and a life-insurance policy is even better.
it's such a coincidence that both roy and jerry died the exact same way
drunk and hit by a car.
it's unfortunate that so many of these released criminals fall into the same destructive patterns of behavior.
hold that thought.
Oh, Mr. Francis. Thank you so much for waiting.
excuse me one second.
did you talk to him? - No. Why would I?
chief, you haven't read them their rights.
no. They haven't given me a reason to -- yet.
thank you for your patience.
I had to say goodbye to mr. Francis, who I just interviewed.
do you think that jim francis had something to do with roy's death?
Oh, I'm certain of it.
and it's strange, you know?
I mean, both he and roy have so much in common
ex-cons, no family, struggles with addiction, and they both had life-insurance policies.
the only difference is...
Jim francis doesn't have tire marks across his chest. - What?
well, don't you have to run them over first before you can collect the life-insurance money?
what is she saying, patty?
I'll answer that.
Roy wilkinson's life-insurance policy -- $80, 000.
beneficiary -- patricia simmons.
and roy had a second policy -- $150, 000.
beneficiary -- karen silva.
though no claim has been made -- yet.
Jerry nemec's policy -- $80, 000.
beneficiary -- patricia simmons.
and he had a second policy -- $150, 000.
beneficiary -- karen silva.
bill johnson, luther madison -- four men in the past five years, all living at your facility, all with life-insurance policies naming one or both of you as beneficiaries.
all from different companies, of course.
and it doesn't take an expert to see that all of these policies are written in the same hand.
no, no. You don't understand.
there are no families to pay for it, the state won't pay for it, and it is not cheap to give a man a decent funeral.
and we can't afford it on what we make. I-I'm a volunteer.
all I've got is my social security.
so, you identify the hardest cases...
and we make arrangements -- just in case.
well, you've become awfully good at identifying men who are 366 days away from being run over in an alley, because that is the exact way that all of these men died one year after you take out a policy.
coincidentally, one year is the same amount of time it takes for a life-insurance policy to vest.
now... I know you killed roy wilkinson.
my question is...
why does jim francis only have one policy?
why does only karen get to cash in on him?
it says so right here.
you greedy bitch! - Patty, shut up!
you greedy
not another word!
not another word! - You said we were done!
I said shut your mouth!
you both have the right to remain silent.
sergeant, could you...
anything you say can be used against you in a court of law.
you have the right to an attorney. - I'll get you!
if you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed to you.
I can afford an attorney!
you got to be kidding me. - Do you understand these rights?
Yes!
all right.
easy, easy! Ladies, that's enough!
come on! - Easy!
calm down. Sit down.
these men were criminals! They were drunks!
with free housing and three meals a day!
and we were waiting on them, getting older by the minute!
at the end of the week, I could hardly stand up!
and you're worried about roy wilkinson?
no. I'm worried about your retirement plan.
now, I'm gonna write one of you up for murder in the first degree and one of you as an accessory. Whose name goes where?
we got roy drunk.
he didn't want to go to the bar at first.
but you told him that one drink wouldn't hurt, and you gave him another and another until you could practically pour him into that car
Jerry nemec's car.
Roy passed out in the backseat, just like jerry.
just like all the others.
but a man who can't move is heavy.
so you put him on a blanket and you pulled him out of the car - and dragged him into the middle of that alley? - Yes.
you know, you're -- you're making it sound a lot worse than it was.
after we hit him, I just wanted to go home.
but you stopped to make sure he was dead. - Was he?
no. He was just moaning.
Karen pulled the car away.
I thought we were leaving. I was so relieved.
and then she drove around the block and she did it again!
Karen? Anything?
she's lying.
well...
that'll be up to a jury to decide which one of you is telling the truth.
I got to say, I don't like your odds.
I just told commander taylor to arrange a press conference for first thing in the morning
let the world know the mayhans had nothing to do with this.
uh, if you don't mind, I think lieutenant flynn should handle this one.
Yeah. Okay. - Thanks.
Hey, chief. - Yes?
thank you.
he's just kidding, vernon. Go ahead, try it. It's a fruit smoothie.
what kind would you like? We've got strawberry-banana.
got any berries? - Sure I've got berries.
I've got some raspberries. I've got some blueberries.
I've got some strawberries. Here you go.
watch this -- a little bit of juice. Not finished yet.
pop in some ice. Pop on the blade.
give it a quick spin... and just watch.
it takes about three
good morning. - Good morning.
what's that?
real-estate flyer -- four bedrooms, ranch style, big backyard, a pool, a custom gourmet kitchen.
and it's within our price range? - Yeah.
Where's it located?
new copper plumbing, new electric, new roof.
where, though?
great school district, perfect for starting a family.
Fritzy, where is it? - Calabasas.
Cal who?
your phone is the duplex, this tissue box, Parker center, your shoes, the FBI on Wilshire, your underwear...
the valley.
and Calabasas is?
there.
that's not even Los Angeles. - It's L. A. County.
just see the place before you decide you hate it.
Brenda, Los Angeles is a big place.
are you saying you don't want me looking anywhere in the valley?
answer, answer, answer.
let it go to voice -- ... Mail.
deputy chief Johnson.
Yes, sergeant Gabriel.
when was that reported?
okay, where are you now?
I'll be there shortly.
critical missing -- 13-year-old boy missing 1 hour and 35 minutes.
you want to call the office and volunteer?
we could practice carpooling.
Sergei Monroe -- age 13. According to his parents, they sent him to his room last night for arguing with his 16-year-old sister, Theresa, at approximately 8: 00 P. M.Yesterday evening.
this morning, 6: 00 A. M. Sergei's mother goes to wake him up, he's gone.
they look around for about 30 minutes, called 911.
do the Monroes have a home-security system, alarms, video cameras?
no, but apparently Sergei does have a cellphone.
we've been calling it, but it just keeps going straight to voice mail.
any sign of forced entry, busted windows, locks?
no, and we interviewed Mr. and Mrs. Monroe, and their daughter all individually, and they all say the same thing.
it was pretty much a normal evening.
chief, kid could be a runaway. He's done this before.
his father said he only called 911 as a precaution anyway.
or because they're in denial.
all right, David.
Mrs. Monroe, Mr. Monroe, I'm deputy chief Brenda Leigh Johnson of the L. A. P. D.
and this is agent Fritz Howard from the FBI.
Oh, my god -- FBI?
Yeah, we help out with critical missings.
critical? What?
anytime a child 13 or under goes missing, we classify their return as our highest priority, which means we won't stop looking until we find your son.
but Sergei's just -- I told your detectives, he's probably gonna show up at school any minute, or if he tries to come home, he's gonna see all of you here and think he's in even more trouble.
Sergei's run away twice before.
he's had a few problems adapting lately.
adapting to what? - America.
Where's he from? - Russia.
we adopted him five years ago.
and you found him through?
an orphanage. He had no family. There's no one.
there's no one in Russia that's gonna be looking for Sergei or trying to kidnap him.
this is -- my god...
so, the last time you saw Sergei was 8: 00 P. M. Last night after you sent him to his room for arguing with his sister.
Yes.
and what was the argument about?
just him using Theresa's things without permission.
I mean, this is nothing we haven't gone through before.
and where's your daughter now?
Theresa, we need to talk to you again.
Theresa, open the door, please.
so, the entire world stops to pay attention to Sergei. Is that it?
I see you like your privacy.
you see my hair?
it used to be a lot longer than this.
then one night Sergei thought it would be funny to cut it off while I was sleeping.
he does cute stuff like that -- for example, torturing and killing my cat.
and no matter what dad tells you, that's why he put the lock on my door because Sergei is a psycho.
you and Sergei had an argument last night. What was that about?
he and his little pathetic friend Jason were
Jason -- who's Jason?
he'll do anything Sergei tells him. It's pitiful.
and yesterday they both created yet another nightmare for our next-door neighbor, Mr. Taft.
what did they do to the neighbor -- your brother and
Sergei's not my brother!
he's only here because my mom wanted to have a boy, and she couldn't have one herself.
okay, you listen to me, Theresa.
Sergei is missing. This is very serious!
someone may have taken him or -- - Taken him?
come with me.
you really think someone would want to abduct a kid who draws like this?
dad has to paint over the walls in here all the time.
chief, excuse me. There's something you should see.
you're so worried about what someone might be doing to Sergei.
I think you should be more concerned about what Sergei is doing to someone else.
yo, move out a sec. Thanks.
dried blood.
Yeah, I think so, too.
s. I. D. is analyzing the sample right now.
and the turn signal's cracked.
is that hair? - It is.
short, black, pulled from the root. Could be the boy's.
Yes. - Looks close.
whose car is this? - Theresa's.
okay, let's impound the vehicle, and Theresa also said something about Sergei and a next-door neighbor, a Mr. Taft.
let's see if we can talk to him.
chief, chief, this way.
according to a lady three houses down, a Mr. Taft -- divorced, lives alone
had an argument last night with Mr. Monroe.
they were standing right out here in the street, screaming and yelling at each other about Sergei.
now, she doesn't know why.
Sanchez is already over here at the Taft house, right here.
so, we're looking at a runaway here or not?
I'd rather have Sergei answer that question.
look here. These look like fresh tire tracks, chief.
see if they match Theresa's car.
chief, no one's answering the door, but there's something in the backyard that we should look at.
okay.
is it locked?
Fritzy, do you mind?
want to lose the bag?
what is that? A grave? We got to get in there.
Oh, for heaven's sakes.
detective, call judge Reisser.
get a search warrant for the house, the yard, and the cars.
okay, meanwhile, gentlemen, we have exigent circumstances, so let's start digging now.
you don't want to wait for a warrant?
no, no. That grave is probable cause.
shovel, shovel, please!
get the warrant anyway.
I don't want a murderer to get away on a technicality. - Okay.
thank you, thank you, detective.
hold it, hold it, hold it.
I got something. I got something. - Okay.
easy, easy.
it's stiff, chief. It's stiff.
okay, okay.
Hey, what's going on here? What are you doing on my property?
l. A. P. D. We've got a search warrant. Get him out of here.
what the hell is going on here? - We have a warrant, sir.
you have no right to do this! No right!
what the hell are you doing on my property? - Police business, sir.
you have no right to do this! No right!
instead of digging up Ralphie, why don't you arrest that little son of a bitch Sergei that killed my dog?
you saw Sergei Monroe do this to your dog?
trust me -- the kid did it.
when was the last time you saw him?
yesterday morning. What -- is Sergei missing?
did he run away... again?
cause if he has, why don't you do everyone in the neighborhood a favor and stop looking for him?
sir, I find your attitude towards this boy worrisome.
how about this for an attitude?
I want that kid dead. How about that?
you want some more suspects?
why don't you go up and down our street?
ask anyone, 'cause everyone hates Sergei -- not just me.
and his parents are useless.
why didn't you report him to the police then?
I did! But you people -- you didn't do anything at all.
and what's the result?
yesterday I came home from work to find my dog dead on my front lawn.
Sergei and that creepy kid
they let him out of the backyard and they ran him down in cold blood.
now, when you say Sergei ran over Ralphie, you mean this 13-year-old kid was driving the vehicle?
Yeah, yeah, he's done it several times.
he takes his big sister's car out on the street for a race.
and that's against the law, isn't it?
What'd you do about that? Nothing.
so, after you found your dog, you went across the street and argued with Sergei's father.
I told Brian before that I would sue his ass, and I will.
what else did you tell him?
a neighbor heard you arguing.
did you threaten Sergei?
I don't remember what I said. I'll tell you what I did.
I took my dog, who never hurt anyone, and I gave him a decent burial.
and then I got drunk.
and if that's a crime, then go ahead and arrest me.
excuse me one second.
Yeah, uh, listen...
let's you and I go take a walk, okay?
do me a favor. Put your hands in your pockets.
okay, do you want to arrest Mr. Taft for burying his dog in his backyard?
Ralphie is not our victim.
but he could be our motive.
or a good reason for Sergei to vamoose.
it explains why the Monroes weren't very specific about the argument they had with their son.
I sent a patrol car over to check Sergei's best friend, Jason.
nobody home, and he didn't go to school today, either.
but no one's reported him missing, and Jason and Sergei both have rap sheets.
I'm waiting to get them, but who knows?
maybe they took off somewhere together.
so, we need to have a discussion about circumstances.
what circumstances?
you want to call off the critical missing?
this kid, Sergei, has an extensive juvenile record and a history of running away.
it appears that his father punished him, not unjustly, and the boy ran off in the middle of the night.
if we investigated everything based on appearances, we'd have a whole lot less to do.
do I get a vote here?
I think it is too early to say what happened.
I'd like a vote, too, because, as of 3: 00 P. M.Today,
I'm gonna have both presidential candidates in town, and I guess I'm gonna have to decide which one not to protect.
so, tell me, chief Johnson, is half my security force out there looking for a runaway?
you want me to decide right now if this is a critical missing?
I do.
would you be applying this kind of pressure if it was your kid we were looking for?
the city of Los Angeles does not want or expect me to run this department the way I do my family.
Sergei was two weeks shy of his 14th birthday.
if his parents called 911 15 days later, we would have sent one patrol car, two uniforms, and filed a report.
so, what are we doing here?
it doesn't feel like a critical missing.
it really doesn't. - Thank you.
priority homicide will continue the search for Sergei Monroe.
meanwhile, commander Taylor, break down the crisis center.
tell the press that, in line with the family's wishes, we're treating this situation as a runaway.
agent Howard, if you remain concerned, you're welcome to stay, of course.
chief, that guy's crying again.
I put him in the back of my car. What do you want me to do with him?
uh, lieutenant Flynn, you can let Mr. Taft go for now.
and if you would, please help me take Ralphie back across the street. Thank you.
chief, the blood on the front of Theresa Monroe's car is, as suspected, canine, and they've matched one of the hairs embedded in the front fender to poor Ralphie.
who was run over by Sergei, if we can believe Mr. Taft.
chief, I'm guessing that you can trust Mr. Taft on this.
I mean, apart from being a building contractor
and I've never had a good experience with a building contractor yet Mr. Taft has no record.
well, our boy Sergei's got him beat big-time.
I've got his rap sheet here.
charges range from vandalism to marijuana possession.
underage driving without a license?
twice.
also, three times for truancy and disturbing the peace with Guess Who.
Hey, maybe these two boys are just hiding out together.
or they were abducted together.
Jason's 14 -- 6 months older than Sergei.
his parents divorced last year, and he's been slipping out of school ever since, compiling his own history with the L. A. P. D.
tried contacting his mother on her cell, home, and office -- no answer.
Yeah, and there's still no answer at the door at the house, either.
okay, I want to check the dates on their arrest records, see how often they were picked up together and, um -- and where.
uh, detective Sanchez.
as soon as either one of them makes a call, we can lock onto the cellphone tower they're using and find them.
why have you stopped looking for my son?
my whole division is applying every resource at its disposal to find your son.
so, Mr. Monroe, this morning, you were certain that Sergei had run away.
he's never been gone more than five hours before -- never.
and you said you wouldn't stop the search until you found him.
I haven't stopped.
but I have been seriously delayed because both you and your wife withheld information from me about the so-called family argument last night.
all right, look, Mr. Taft is already very upset.
I didn't want to drag him into this. - Drag him into it?
sir, if Mr. Taft's story is true, he may well be the reason that Sergei is missing.
now, did Sergei run over his dog? - Yes.
with Theresa's car? - Yes.
Jason let the dog out. Sergei ran him down.
we asked Theresa not to mention this to you. - Because?
because we were afraid that if you thought Sergei was a problem child, instead of bringing him home, you might arrest him.
look, we're mortified about the entire situation. We apologize.
and we're slow to understand how terrible it could be.
I mean, do you have anything at all?
the name Jason Hetner keeps coming up, and we can't find him, either.
Jason's missing, too?
not technically.
but we can't find him, and we'd really like to.
well, Jason's a bad influence. There's no question about it.
we tried to separate them.
but his mother won't call us back or meet with us, even though they've been arrested together.
uh, speaking of... - Yes, sergeant, what'd you find?
Jason and Sergei both have been reported for trespassing three times at a place known as the tunnels.
it's a neighborhood magnet for
we know what it's a magnet for, and I've absolutely forbidden Sergei to go there again.
I mean, it's dangerous. Why
Oh, Susan, we should go there and see if he's there or if Jason's there.
uh, no, no, no, no, no. We're going.
I would like to come with you.
look, ma'am, I understand why you would like to come, but it is more important that you and your husband go home and wait for Sergei to call.
no, no, our daughter's there with the people you have covering the phones, and Theresa will call us the second that Sergei comes back.
if he sees me, if he hears me call his name, he'd be more likely to answer.
please, I do better with him than anyone else.
Sergei? Sergei, it's mom!
Mrs. Monroe, I have to ask you not to call out, please.
we don't know who all's in here. Thank you.
nice hideout.
all right, lieutenant Provenza, please wait here with the parents.
lieutenant Tao, I'd like to get a patrol car or two, if we can get them.
all right, then, let's see what all's down here.
l. A. P. D. Anyone in here?
just a rat. Just a rat.
relax.
chief? Chief!
okay, okay, okay.
okay, detective Sanchez, lieutenant Flynn, let's find out if Sergei's by himself in here.
detective Daniels, please step outside and call the morgue and S. I. D.
I need this place checked for a weapon and blood.
and I want the search revved up for Jason Hetner, please.
you got it.
Hey, where are you going?
I'm getting some air.
besides, this isn't a critical missing anymore, is it?
what did you find? Hello?
Hello? Is he in there? Did you find him? Hello?
suffered two blows to the head from an almost-blunt instrument
a bad hit here at the left temple, then a very bad hit here at the left central parietal bone
death almost instantaneous.
there wasn't a lot of blood where we found him.
then he died elsewhere.
hmm, that also explains why we found no weapon.
well, look for something that leaves a waffle pattern.
see this cross-hatching with dimples?
probably some sort of tool, I'm guessing.
like for construction?
maybe something a building contractor might have.
sounds right.
were there any signs of molestation? - No, thank god.
the poor kid was murdered, but it stopped there.
would you preserve the wounds for me, doctor?
with a casting or the epidermis itself?
uh, cut out the actual wound, please. Thank you.
would you like that for here or to go?
doctor. - Chief Pope.
uh, time of death?
the boy was found in a dark, moist place, which could have sped up the decomp.
so, I'd have to say, broadly, between 6 and 24 hours.
thank you.
as soon as you can, please, doctor. Excuse me.
I-I made a horrible mistake.
will, we have two things to rely on -- instinct and training.
we went with our gut feelings, and because of that, this boy is dead.
we don't know our culpability yet.
Sergei could have left the house in the middle of the night.
he could have been dead before we got the call.
and on his body, we found a cellphone and some pot, so
so, it wasn't a robbery. What are you suggesting then?
this was, what? A fight between friends or that Sergei was a little drug dealer?
cause that's a big "so what?" He's still a 13-year-old kid.
what about this friend -- this Jason Hetner.
is he a suspect or another possible victim?
uh, I can't say.
we are having trouble locating him, but I have the rest of my detectives and six patrol cars out looking for him.
all right, as of now, Jason Hetner is missing.
use any resources you have to find him. I don't care what it costs.
excuse me, chiefs, detective Sanchez just found Jason.
he's on his way down to Parker Center with him right now.
is the boy all right?
he's okay enough to run.
the little bastard's fast, too.
Yeah, so, his mother finally comes home, and we ask her, you know, "can we look in your garage? Can we look in your son's room"?
and she says, "is this all because he skipped school again"?
like it was nothing at all.
is she here now? Jason's mother?
too tired. Great mom, huh?
didn't see her son this morning. Hadn't seen him since last night.
she finally lets us into Jason's room.
and as I'm looking in the kid's closet, guess who crawls out from under the bed.
and he jumps out the window, and I have to chase him for five blocks.
so, any chance this boy is our murderer?
he ran.
okay, let's go, sergeant.
good work, good work.
Hello, Jason. I'm deputy chief Brenda Leigh Johnson.
I just have a few questions about the last 24 hours.
questions I don't have to answer, right?
that's true.
instead of you and I having a little conversation, I could arrest you and send you to juvie.
and since you've demonstrated that you're a flight risk,
I will personally speak at your petition to detain.
you'll be in custody for the entire six months leading up to your trial.
is that really how you want to spend your summer and fall?
no.
let's try the questions, then, shall we?
you are friends with Sergei Monroe, are you not?
ask Sergei who his friends are.
all right, never mind.
book this little smart aleck. - No, no, no, no, wait, wait, wait. Wait. Wait a minute!
how much trouble am I in?
well, I can guarantee you it's gonna get worse if you don't cooperate.
fine, fine. I'll tell you what happened yesterday.
I just want some protection.
protection from who?
from Sergei.
and why do you need protection from him?
he makes me do things.
makes you? How does he make you?
he just does.
well, what does he use? A knife, a gun?
I mean, come on, you're bigger than Sergei.
he knows.
he knows certain things about me. - What things?
that's not part of the story, okay?
God, all right? He just makes me do things!
I need to know what that means or I am leaving.
I'm leaving. - No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Wait a minute!
okay. If you want to know, okay.
Sergei pulled me into an alley once, and...
he grabbed my hand... pulled me towards him...
asked me if I...
he asked me...
are you saying Sergei made sexual advances on you?
Yes. - What did he do?
he... asked me if I wanted to kiss him.
and I did.
but Sergei didn't. It was a trap.
then every day after that, he threatened to tell people all about me.
so, he's been blackmailing you?
Yeah.
ain't love grand? Geez Louise. This Sergei kid.
he can't know that I'm telling you this.
that's a promise I can keep, provided that you tell me exactly what happened yesterday.
okay.
so, Sergei wanted me to let Ralphie out in Mr. Taft's yard.
he was gonna drive Theresa's car up the street, and the dog would chase it.
I opened the gate, and Ralphie ran out in the front yard.
but Sergei didn't drive off. He...
he gunned the car over the curb, and he hit the dog.
I jumped off the fence.
I ran, and I tried to help Ralphie, but he was making these -- these gurgling sounds.
okay? I'm sorry. - Okay, okay.
what happened then?
well, then, I made Sergei take the car back into the garage.
and look, really, if I had known that he
that he was gonna kill Ralphie, I would have never helped him -- never.
so, did you fight with him after that?
did you punish him for what he did to Ralphie?
punish him?
you're kidding, right?
Jason, Sergei Monroe was found dead this afternoon in a place you two were known to hang out -- the tunnels.
what?
he -- how did...
wait, oh, my -- you think that -- you think that I killed him?
it w-wasn't me! It was Mr. Taft! It was ,Mr. Taft!
I'm telling you, it was Mr. Taft, okay? - How do you know it was Mr. Taft?
because I-I heard him.
he was screaming at Mr. Monroe in the street, okay?
and -- and he was saying to him how he was gonna -- how he's gonna kill Sergei.
right back where we started.
but I didn't hear anything after that. - Damn it.
because that's when Sergei's sister came in the garage when we were hammering out the dents.
and she was freaking out, and I ran. I just ran.
did you say hammering out the dents?
voice-mail recordings from Sergei Monroe's cellphone minus the messages from L. A. P. D.
okay, thank you.
uh, do you have a flashlight, lieutenant, and a cellphone, please?
thank you. Thanks.
are you looking for something, chief?
a circular waffle pattern...
that matches... this.
what do you think, lieutenant?
I think you got a match.
you want me to take off the fender?
Yes, please, and could you bring it to the murder room? Thank you.
Luis, pull that fender.
what makes a child go bad -- nature or nurture?
unfortunately, chief, by the time we get involved, it really doesn't matter.
Sergei, this Theresa, and I hate your stupid guts. I hate you!
you've ruined my car, and when you get home, I'm going to kill you!
message received yesterday at 7: 18 A. M.
damn it, Sergei, the police are outside your house!
man, leave me out of this.
message received yesterday at 7: 43 A. M.
Sergei, you're destroying this family. Mom can't stop crying.
dad's going out of his mind, all because of you. I hope you're dead.
I hope you've been run over the same way you ran over Ralphie.
sounds like there's more than one problem child out there.
there are no more messages in your mailbox
you were right. I should have kept the critical-missing designation.
Yeah. Well...
the odds were stacked against you from the start.
Hey, I was looking at that.
it sold already.
you were right. It was too far away.
the only reason to move out there is the schools.
otherwise, maybe more house than we need.
maybe more trouble than we want to go through.
what do you think?
let's talk about it tonight. Is that okay?
okay.
Hey, have a good day at work. - You too.
lieutenant Provenza, good morning.
I'm on my way to the morgue, and I need you to do a few things for me first.
you had lieutenant Provenza arrest Theresa Monroe for murdering her brother?
Yes.
time of death?
I won't know exactly until I get the confession.
all right, well, uh, I'll watch then.
excuse me.
Theresa's parents haven't asked for a lawyer, but they do want to be in the room while you talk to her.
buzz has already set up some extra cameras.
I'll take care of it.
uh, lieutenant, I need a waiver form, please. - Yes, ma'am.
our daughter would never murder her own brother ever.
well, Theresa told me that she didn't think of Sergei as her actual brother.
and you know what? I believe her.
how can you do this to us after all we've been through?
look, if you want to stay here while I interview your daughter,
I need you and your wife to initial the marked areas and sign on the bottom or leave.
this explains your rights.
Theresa, you recognize this fender?
I didn't do anything to Sergei.
are you suggesting that Theresa ran over our son?
sir, sign the forms or leave! There's no in between!
let's look underneath the fender, please.
on the underside -- see this waffle pattern?
someone was trying to pound the fender back into shape.
this is from Sergei's scalp -- the skin from one of the bludgeoning wounds that killed him!
get it away from me! Get it away from me, mom! Mom!
